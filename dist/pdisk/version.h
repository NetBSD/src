/*
 *	TO ADJUST THE VERSION - change the following six macros.
 *
 * A version is of the form:	N.M{.X}{yZ}
 * 
 * 	N is two digits indicating the major version
 *	M is a single digit indicating relative revision
 *	X is a single digit indicating a bug fix revision
 *	y is a character from the set [dab] indicating stage (dev,alpha,beta)
 *	Z is two digits indicating the delta within the stage
 *
 * Note that within the 'vers' resource all these fields end up
 * comprising a four byte uint32_teger with the property that any later
 * version will be be represented by a larger number.
