     The ppkkgg__aadddd command is used to extract and upgrade packages that have
     been previously created with the pkg_create(1) command.  Packages are
     prepared collections of pre-built binaries, documentation, configura-
     tions, installation instructions and/or other files.  ppkkgg__aadddd can recur-
     sively install other packages that the current package depends on or
     requires from both local disk and via FTP or HTTP.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     The following command line arguments are supported:

     _p_k_g_-_n_a_m_e [_._._.]
             The named packages are installed.  _p_k_g_-_n_a_m_e may be either a URL
             or a local pathname, a package name of "-" will cause ppkkgg__aadddd to
             read from stdin.  If the packages are not found in the current
             working directory, ppkkgg__aadddd will search them in each directory
             named by the PKG_PATH environment variable.  Any dependencies
             required by the installed package will be searched in the same
             location that the original package was installed from.

     --AA      Mark package as installed automatically, as dependency of another
             package.  You can use
                   ppkkgg__aaddmmiinn sseett aauuttoommaattiicc==YYEESS
             to mark packages this way after installation, and
                   ppkkgg__aaddmmiinn uunnsseett aauuttoommaattiicc
             to remove the mark.  If you ppkkgg__aadddd a package without specifying
             --AA after it had already been automatically installed, the mark is
             removed.

     --ff      Force installation to proceed even if prerequisite packages are
             not installed or the install script fails.  Although ppkkgg__aadddd will
             still try to find and auto-install missing prerequisite packages,
             a failure to find one will not be fatal.  This flag also over-
             rides the fatal error when the operating system or architecture
             the package was built on differ from that of the host.

     --II      If an installation script exists for a given package, do not exe-
             cute it.

     --KK _p_k_g___d_b_d_i_r
             Set _p_k_g___d_b_d_i_r as the package database directory.  If this option
             isn't specified, then the package database directory is taken
             from the value of the environment variable PKG_DBDIR if it's set,
             otherwise it defaults to _/_v_a_r_/_d_b_/_p_k_g.

     --LL      Don't add the package to any views after installation.

     --nn      Don't actually install a package, just report the steps that
             would be taken if it was.

     --pp _p_r_e_f_i_x
             Set _p_r_e_f_i_x as the directory in which to extract files from a
             package.  If a package has set its default directory, it will be
             overridden by this flag.  Note that only the first @@ccwwdd directive
             will be replaced, since ppkkgg__aadddd has no way of knowing which
             directory settings are relative and which are absolute.  Only one
             directory transition is supported and the second one is expected
             to go into _p_k_g_d_b.

     --RR      Do not record the installation of a package.  This means that you
             cannot deinstall it later, so only use this option if you know
             what you are doing!

     --ss _v_e_r_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_-_t_y_p_e
             Use a callout to an external program to verify the binary package
             being installed against an existing detached signature file.  The
             signature file must reside in the same directory as the binary
             package.  At the present time, the following verification types
             are defined: none, gpg and pgp5.  The signature will be verified
             at install time, and the results will be displayed.  If the sig-
             nature type is anything other than none, the user will be asked
             if ppkkgg__aadddd should proceed to install the binary package.  The
             user must then take the decision whether to proceed or not,
             depending upon the amount of trust that is placed in the signa-
             tory of the binary package.  Please note that, at the current
             time, it is not possible to use the verification feature when
             using ppkkgg__aadddd to add a binary package via a URL - the package,
             and the related detached signature file, must be local for the
             verification to work.

     --tt _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e
             Use _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e as the input to mktemp(3) when creating a ``staging
             area''.  By default, this is the string _/_v_a_r_/_t_m_p_/_i_n_s_t_m_p_._X_X_X_X_X_X,
             but it may be necessary to override it in the situation where
             space in your _/_v_a_r_/_t_m_p directory is limited.  Be sure to leave
             some number of `X' characters for mktemp(3) to fill in with a
             unique ID.

             You can get a performance boost by setting the staging area
             _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e to reside on the same disk partition as target directo-
             ries for package file installation; often this is _/_u_s_r.

     --uu      If the package that's being installed is already installed,
             either in the same or a different version, an update is per-
             formed.  If this is specified twice, then any dependant packages
             that are too old will also be updated to fulfill the dependency.
             See below for a more detailed description of the process.

     --VV      Print version number and exit.

     --vv      Turn on verbose output.

     --WW _v_i_e_w_b_a_s_e
             Set _v_i_e_w_b_a_s_e as the base directory for the managed views.  The
             default _v_i_e_w_b_a_s_e directory is set by pkg_view(1).  This value
             also may be set from the LOCALBASE environment variable.

     --ww _v_i_e_w
             Set the _v_i_e_w to which packages should be added after installa-
             tion.  The default _v_i_e_w is set by pkg_view(1).  This value also
             may be set from the PKG_VIEW environment variable.

     One or more _p_k_g_-_n_a_m_e arguments may be specified, each being either a file
     containing the package (these usually ending with the ``.tgz'' suffix) or
     a URL pointing at a file available on an ftp or web site.  Thus you may
     extract files directly from their anonymous ftp or WWW locations (e.g.,
     ppkkgg__aadddd ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/pkgsrc/pack-
     ages/NetBSD-3.1/i386/shells/bash-3.2.9.tgz or ppkkgg__aadddd http://www.exam-
     ple.org/packages/screen-4.0.tbz).  Note:  For ftp transfers, if you wish
     to use _p_a_s_s_i_v_e _m_o_d_e ftp in such transfers, set the variable _F_T_P___P_A_S_-
     _S_I_V_E___M_O_D_E to some value in your environment.  Otherwise, the more stan-
     dard ACTIVE mode may be used.  If ppkkgg__aadddd consistently fails to fetch a
     package from a site known to work, it may be because you have a firewall
     that demands the usage of _p_a_s_s_i_v_e _m_o_d_e ftp.

TTEECCHHNNIICCAALL DDEETTAAIILLSS
     ppkkgg__aadddd extracts each package's ``packing list'' into a special staging
     directory in /var/tmp (or $PKG_TMPDIR if set) and then runs through the
     following sequence to fully extract the contents of the package:

           1.   A check is made to determine if the package or another version
                of it is already recorded as installed.  If it is, installa-
                tion is terminated if the --uu option is not given.

                If the --uu option is given, it's assumed the package should be
                replaced by the new version instead.  Before doing so, all
                packages that depend on the pkg being upgraded are checked if
                they also work with the new version.  If that test is success-
                ful, replacing is prepared by moving an existing _+_R_E_Q_U_I_R_E_D___B_Y
                file aside (if it exists), and running pkg_delete(1) on the
                installed package.  Installation then proceeds as if the pack-
                age was not installed, and restores the _+_R_E_Q_U_I_R_E_D___B_Y file
                afterwards.

           2.   A check is made to determine if the package conflicts (from
                @@ppkkggccffll directives, see pkg_create(1)) with an already
                recorded as installed package.  If it is, installation is ter-
                minated.

           3.   All package dependencies (from @@ppkkggddeepp directives, see
                pkg_create(1)) are read from the packing list.  If any of
                these required packages are not currently installed, an
                attempt is made to find and install it; if the missing package
                cannot be found or installed, the installation is terminated.
                If the --uu option was specified twice, any required packages
                that are installed, but which have a version number that is
                considered to be too old, are also updated.  The dependant
                packages are found according to the normal PKG_PATH rules.

           4.   A search is made for any @@ooppttiioonn directives which control how
                the package is added to the system.  The only currently imple-
                mented option is @@ooppttiioonn eexxttrraacctt--iinn--ppllaaccee, which causes the
                package to be extracted directly into its prefix directory
                rather than moving it through a staging area in _/_v_a_r_/_t_m_p.

           5.   If @@ooppttiioonn eexxttrraacctt--iinn--ppllaaccee is enabled, the package is now
                extracted directly into its final location, otherwise it is
                extracted into the staging area.

           6.   The package build information is extracted from the
                _+_B_U_I_L_D___I_N_F_O file and compared against the result of uname(3).
                If the operating system or architecture of the package differ
                from that of the host, installation is aborted.  This behavior
                is overridable with the --ff flag.

           7.   The package build information from _+_B_U_I_L_D___I_N_F_O is then checked
                for USE_ABI_DEPENDS=NO (or IGNORE_RECOMMENDED).  If the pack-
                age was built with ABI dependency recommendations ignored, a
                warning will be issued.

           8.   If the package contains an _i_n_s_t_a_l_l script, it is executed with
                the following arguments:

                _p_k_g_-_n_a_m_e      The name of the package being installed.

                PPRREE--IINNSSTTAALLLL   Keyword denoting that the script is to perform
                              any actions needed before the package is
                              installed.

                If the _i_n_s_t_a_l_l script exits with a non-zero status code, the
                installation is terminated.

           9.   If @@ooppttiioonn eexxttrraacctt--iinn--ppllaaccee is not present in the packing
                list, then it is used as a guide for moving (or copying, as
                necessary) files from the staging area into their final loca-
                tions.

           10.  If an _i_n_s_t_a_l_l script exists for the package, it is executed
                with the following arguments:

                _p_k_g___n_a_m_e      The name of the package being installed.

                PPOOSSTT--IINNSSTTAALLLL  Keyword denoting that the script is to perform
                              any actions needed after the package has been
                              installed.

           11.  After installation is complete, a copy of the packing list,
                _d_e_i_n_s_t_a_l_l script, description, and display files are copied
                into _/_v_a_r_/_d_b_/_p_k_g_/_<_p_k_g_-_n_a_m_e_> for subsequent possible use by
                pkg_delete(1).  Any package dependencies are recorded in the
                other packages' _/_v_a_r_/_d_b_/_p_k_g_/_<_o_t_h_e_r_-_p_k_g_>_/_+_R_E_Q_U_I_R_E_D___B_Y file (if
                an alternate package database directory is specified, then it
                overrides the _/_v_a_r_/_d_b_/_p_k_g path shown above).

           12.  If the package is a depoted package, then add it to the
                default view.

           13.  The staging area is deleted and the program terminates.

           14.  Finally, if we were upgrading a package, any _+_R_E_Q_U_I_R_E_D___B_Y file
                that was moved aside before upgrading was started is now moved
                back into place.

     The _i_n_s_t_a_l_l script is called with the environment variable PKG_PREFIX set
     to the installation prefix (see the --pp option above).  This allows a
     package author to write a script that reliably performs some action on
     the directory where the package is installed, even if the user might
     change it with the --pp flag to ppkkgg__aadddd.  The scripts are also called with
     the PKG_METADATA_DIR environment variable set to the location of the _+_*
     meta-data files, and with the PKG_REFCOUNT_DBDIR environment variable set
     to the location of the package reference counts database directory.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     LOCALBASE   This is the location of the _v_i_e_w_b_a_s_e directory in which all
                 the views are managed.  The default _v_i_e_w_b_a_s_e directory is
                 _/_u_s_r_/_p_k_g.

     PKG_DBDIR   If the --KK flag isn't given, then PKG_DBDIR is the location of
                 the package database directory.  The default package database
                 directory is _/_v_a_r_/_d_b_/_p_k_g.

     PKG_PATH    The value of the PKG_PATH is used if a given package can't be
                 found, it's usually set to _/_u_s_r_/_p_k_g_s_r_c_/_p_a_c_k_a_g_e_s_/_A_l_l.  The
                 environment variable should be a series of entries separated
                 by semicolons.  Each entry consists of a directory name or
                 URL.  The current directory may be indicated implicitly by an
                 empty directory name, or explicitly by a single period.  FTP
                 URLs may not end with a slash.

     PKG_REFCOUNT_DBDIR
                 Location of the package reference counts database directory.
                 The default location is the path to the package database
                 directory with ``.refcount'' appended to the path, e.g.
                 _/_v_a_r_/_d_b_/_p_k_g_._r_e_f_c_o_u_n_t.

     PKG_TMPDIR  Staging directory for installing packages, defaults to
                 /var/tmp.  Set to directory with lots of free disk if you run
                 out of space when installing a binary package.

     PKG_VIEW    The default view can be specified in the PKG_VIEW environment
                 variable.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
     In all cases, ppkkgg__aadddd will try to install binary packages listed in
     dependencies list.

     You can specify a compiled binary package explicitly on the command line.

     # pkg_add /usr/pkgsrc/packages/All/tcsh-6.14.00.tgz

     If you omit the version number, ppkkgg__aadddd will install the latest version
     available.  With --vv, ppkkgg__aadddd emits more messages to terminal.

     # pkg_add -v /usr/pkgsrc/packages/All/unzip

     You can grab a compiled binary package from remote location by specifying
     a URL.  The URL can be put into an environment variable, PKG_PATH.

     # pkg_add -v ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD-3.1/i386/All/firefox-2.0.0.4.tgz

     # export PKG_PATH=ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD-3.1/i386/All/
     # pkg_add -v firefox

     Over time, as problems are found in packages, they will be moved from the
     _A_l_l subdirectory into the _v_u_l_n_e_r_a_b_l_e subdirectory.  If you want to accept
     vulnerable packages by default (and know what you are doing), you can add
     the _v_u_l_n_e_r_a_b_l_e directory to your PKG_PATH like this:

     # export PKG_PATH="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD-3.1/i386/All/;ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD-3.1/i386/vulnerable/"

     (The quotes are needed because semicolon (`;') is a shell meta-charac-
     ter.)  If you do this, consider installing and using the
     _s_e_c_u_r_i_t_y_/_a_u_d_i_t_-_p_a_c_k_a_g_e_s package and running it after every ppkkgg__aadddd.

     Hard links between files in a distribution are only preserved if either
     (1) the staging area is on the same file system as the target directory
     of all the links to the file, or (2) all the links to the file are brack-
     eted by @@ccwwdd directives in the contents file, _a_n_d and the link names are
     extracted with a single ttaarr command (not split between invocations due to
     exec argument-space limitations--this depends on the value returned by
     ssyyssccoonnff(___S_C___A_R_G___M_A_X)).

     Package upgrading needs a lot more work to be really universal.
