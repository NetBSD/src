     The bbppmm command is used to locate and install binary packages from any
     reachable URL.

     The following command-line options are supported:

     --bb _b_a_s_e_U_R_L
             Specify a base URL from which to download binary packages.  The
             default URL is _f_t_p_:_/_/_f_t_p_._N_e_t_B_S_D_._o_r_g_/_p_u_b_/_N_e_t_B_S_D_/_p_a_c_k_a_g_e_s.

     --hh      Print a help message and then exit.

     --mm _m_a_c_h_i_n_e
             Use _m_a_c_h_i_n_e as the machine architecture to be used, instead of
             that returned by uname(1).

     --nn      Don't actually execute the commands to add the package.

     --rr _r_e_l_e_a_s_e
             Use _r_e_l_e_a_s_e as the operating system release to be used, instead
             of that returned by uname(1).

     --VV      Print version number and exit.

     --vv      Turn on verbose output.

     --ww _s_e_c_o_n_d_s
             The number of _s_e_c_o_n_d_s to wait after displaying an error message
             and returning to normal menu operations.

     bbppmm provides a menu-based binary package manager for NetBSD.  bbppmm first
     connects to the URL using ftp(1), and displays a list of categories for
     which binary packages exist.  If no categories are displayed, it could be
     that the machine architecture or operating system release string have
     been wrongly interpreted, and that it will be necessary to override this
     values by means of the command line options.  Within a category, a list
     of packages will be displayed, and by selecting one using the number
     assigned to it, the package will be downloaded automatically, and
     installed, using the pkg_add(1) utility.  It is also possible to change
     the category currently being examined, and to quit from the utility, sim-
     ply by selecting the appropriate choices on the menu.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     The environment variables which govern the behaviour of ftp(1) and
     pkg_add(1) are valid for bbppmm.
