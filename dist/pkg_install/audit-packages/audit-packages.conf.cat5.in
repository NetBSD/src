     The aauuddiitt--ppaacckkaaggeess..ccoonnff file contains the configuration information for
     download-vulnerability-list(8) and audit-packages(8).

     These variables can be defined in the audit-packages.conf(8) file.

     GPG            The full path to the location of the binary used to verify
                    the signature on the downloaded _p_k_g_-_v_u_l_n_e_r_a_b_i_l_i_t_i_e_s file.
                    Currently only GnuPG is supported.

                    The default is "@prefix@/bin/gpg".

     PKGVULNDIR     Specifies the directory containing the _p_k_g_-_v_u_l_n_e_r_a_b_i_l_i_t_i_e_s
                    file.

                    The default is "@pkgdbdir@".

     COMPRESS_TYPE  Specifies which type of compressed _p_k_g_-_v_u_l_n_e_r_a_b_i_l_i_t_i_e_s
                    file to download.  You can also specify COMPRESS_TYPE=""
                    to use and uncompressed version of the file.  If you
                    change this from the default you must specify a COM-
                    PRESS_TOOL.  The currently accepted options are gzip and
                    bzip2.

     COMPRESS_TOOL  The full path to the location of the binary used to decom-
                    press the downloaded _p_k_g_-_v_u_l_n_e_r_a_b_i_l_i_t_i_e_s file.

                    The default is "@gzcat@".

     FETCH_CMD      Specifies the client used to download the
                    _p_k_g_-_v_u_l_n_e_r_a_b_i_l_i_t_i_e_s file.  Currently known tools include
                    curl, ftp, wget and fetch.

                    The default is @ftp@.

     FETCH_ARGS     Specifies optional arguments for the client used to down-
                    load the _p_k_g_-_v_u_l_n_e_r_a_b_i_l_i_t_i_e_s file.

     FETCH_PROTO    Specifies the protocol to use when fetching the
                    _p_k_g_-_v_u_l_n_e_r_a_b_i_l_i_t_i_e_s file.  Currently supports only http
                    and ftp.

                    The default is "ftp".

     IGNORE_URLS    A list of vulnerability URLs to be ignored.  This allows
                    for ignoring certain URLs that are attached to a vulnera-
                    bility.

     The aauuddiitt--ppaacckkaaggeess and ddoowwnnllooaadd--vvuullnneerraabbiilliittyy--lliisstt commands were origi-
     nally implemented and added to NetBSD's pkgsrc by Alistair Crooks on
     September 19, 2000.  During April 2007 aauuddiitt--ppaacckkaaggeess was re-written by
     Adrian Portelli and support was added for compressed files and checking
     signatures on downloaded files.  The original idea came from Roland
     Dowdeswell and Bill Sommerfeld.
