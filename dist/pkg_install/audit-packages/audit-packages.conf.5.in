.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm audit-packages
and
.Nm download-vulnerability-list
commands were originally implemented and added to
.Nx Ap s
pkgsrc by
.An Alistair Crooks
on September 19, 2000.  During April 2007 
.Nm audit-packages 
was re-written by Adrian Portelli and support was added for compressed 
files and checking signatures on downloaded files.  The original idea 
came from Roland Dowdeswell and Bill Sommerfeld.
