DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The ppkkgg__ccrreeaattee command is used to create packages that will subsequently
     be fed to one of the package extraction/info utilities.  The input
     description and command line arguments for the creation of a package are
     not really meant to be human-generated, though it is easy enough to do
     so.  It is more expected that you will use a front-end tool for the job
     rather than muddling through it yourself.  Nonetheless, a short descrip-
     tion of the input syntax is included in this document.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     The following command line options are supported:

     --BB _b_u_i_l_d_-_i_n_f_o_-_f_i_l_e
             Install the file _b_u_i_l_d_-_i_n_f_o_-_f_i_l_e so that users of binary packages
             can see what make(1) definitions were used to control the build
             when creating the binary package.  This allows various build def-
             initions to be retained in a binary package and viewed wherever
             it is installed, using pkg_info(1).

     --bb _b_u_i_l_d_-_v_e_r_s_i_o_n_-_f_i_l_e
             Install the file _b_u_i_l_d_-_v_e_r_s_i_o_n_-_f_i_l_e so that users of binary pack-
             ages can see what versions of the files used to control the build
             were used when creating the binary package.  This allows some
             fine-grained version control information to be retained in a
             binary package and viewed wherever it is installed, using
             pkg_info(1).

     --CC _c_p_k_g_s
             Set the initial package conflict list to _c_p_k_g_s.  This is assumed
             to be a whitespace separated list of package names and is meant
             as a convenient shorthand for specifying multiple @@ppkkggccffll direc-
             tives in the packing list (see PACKING LIST DETAILS section
             below).

     --cc _[_-_]_d_e_s_c
             Fetch package (one line description) from file _d_e_s_c or, if pre-
             ceded by --, the argument itself.  This string should also give
             some idea of which version of the product (if any) the package
             represents.

     --DD _d_i_s_p_l_a_y_f_i_l_e
             Display the file after installing the package.  Useful for things
             like legal notices on almost-free software, etc.

     --dd _[_-_]_d_e_s_c
             Fetch long description for package from file _d_e_s_c or, if preceded
             by --, the argument itself.

     --EE      Add an empty views file to the package.

     --ff _p_a_c_k_l_i_s_t
             Fetch (packing list) for package from the file _p_a_c_k_l_i_s_t or ssttddiinn
             if _p_a_c_k_l_i_s_t is a -- (dash).

     --II _r_e_a_l_p_r_e_f_i_x
             Provide the real prefix, as opposed to the staging prefix, for
             use in staged installations of packages.

     --ii _i_s_c_r_i_p_t
             Set _i_s_c_r_i_p_t to be the install procedure for the package.  This
             can be any executable program (or shell script).  It will be
             invoked automatically when the package is later installed.

     --KK _p_k_g___d_b_d_i_r
             Set _p_k_g___d_b_d_i_r as the package database directory.  If this option
             isn't specified, then the package database directory is taken
             from the value of the environment variable PKG_DBDIR if it's set,
             otherwise it defaults to _/_v_a_r_/_d_b_/_p_k_g.

     --kk _d_s_c_r_i_p_t
             Set _d_s_c_r_i_p_t to be the de-install procedure for the package.  This
             can be any executable program (or shell script).  It will be
             invoked automatically when the package is later (if ever) de-
             installed.

     --LL _S_r_c_D_i_r
             This sets the package's @src directive; see below for a descrip-
             tion of what this does.

     --ll      Check that any symbolic links which are to be placed in the pack-
             age are relative to the current prefix.  This means using
             unlink(2) and symlink(2) to remove and re-link any symbolic links
             which are targeted at full path names.

     --mm _m_t_r_e_e_f_i_l_e
             Run mtree(8) with input from mtreefile before the package is
             installed.  Mtree is invoked as mmttrreeee --uu --ff _m_t_r_e_e_f_i_l_e --dd --ee --pp
             _p_r_e_f_i_x, where _p_r_e_f_i_x is the name of the first directory named by
             a @@ccwwdd directive.

     --nn _p_r_e_s_e_r_v_e_-_f_i_l_e
             The file is used to denote that the package should not be
             deleted.  This is intended for use where the deletion of packages
             may present a bootstrap problem.

     --OO      Go into a (packing list only) mode.  This is used to do (fake
             pkg_add) operations when a package is installed.  In such cases,
             it is necessary to know what the final, adjusted packing list
             will look like.

     --PP _d_p_k_g_s
             Set the initial package dependency list to _d_p_k_g_s.  This is
             assumed to be a whitespace separated list of package names and is
             meant as a convenient shorthand for specifying multiple @@ppkkggddeepp
             directives in the packing list (see PACKING LIST DETAILS section
             below).  In addition, the exact versions of the packages referred
             to in the _d_p_k_g_s list will be added to the packing list in the
             form of @@bbllddddeepp directives.

     --TT _b_u_i_l_d_p_k_g_s
             The exact versions of the packages referred to in the _b_u_i_l_d_p_k_g_s
             list will be added to the packing list in the form of @@bbllddddeepp
             directives.  This directives are stored after those created by
             the --PP option.  _b_u_i_l_d_p_k_g_s is assumed to be a whitespace separated
             list of package names.

     --pp _p_r_e_f_i_x
             Set _p_r_e_f_i_x as the initial directory (base) to start from in
             selecting files for the package.

     --RR      Re-order any directories in the pkg/PLIST file into reverse
             alphabetic order, so that child directories will automatically be
             removed before parent directories.

     --SS _s_i_z_e_-_a_l_l_-_f_i_l_e
             Store the given file for later querying with the pkg_info(1) --SS
             flag.  The file is expected to contain the size (in bytes) of all
             files of this package plus any required packages added up and
             stored as a ASCII string, terminated by a newline.

     --ss _s_i_z_e_-_p_k_g_-_f_i_l_e
             Store the given file for later querying with the pkg_info(1) --ss
             flag.  The file is expected to contain the size (in bytes) of all
             files of this package added up and stored as a ASCII string, ter-
             minated by a newline.

     --tt _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e
             Use _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e as the input to mktemp(3).  By default, this is the
             string _/_t_m_p_/_i_n_s_t_m_p_._X_X_X_X_X_X, but it may be necessary to override it
             in the situation where space in your _/_t_m_p directory is limited.
             Be sure to leave some number of `X' characters for mktemp(3) to
             fill in with a unique ID.

     --UU      Do not update the package file database with any file informa-
             tion.

     --VV      Print version number and exit.

     --vv      Turn on verbose output.

PPAACCKKIINNGG LLIISSTT DDEETTAAIILLSS
     The (packing list) format (see --ff) is fairly simple, being nothing more
     than a single column of filenames to include in the package.  However,
     since absolute pathnames are generally a bad idea for a package that
     could be installed potentially anywhere, there is another method of spec-
     ifying where things are supposed to go and, optionally, what ownership
     and mode information they should be installed with.  This is done by
     embedding specialized command sequences in the packing list.  Briefly
     described, these sequences are:
     @@ccwwdd _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
             Set the internal directory pointer to point to _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y.  All
             subsequent filenames will be assumed relative to this directory.
             Note: @@ccdd is also an alias for this command.
     @@ssrrcc _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
             Set the internal directory pointer for _creation only_ to
             _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y.  That is to say that it overrides @@ccwwdd for package
             creation but not extraction.
     @@eexxeecc _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
             Execute _c_o_m_m_a_n_d as part of the unpacking process.  If _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
             contains any of the following sequences somewhere in it, they
             will be expanded inline.  For the following examples, assume that
             @@ccwwdd is set to _/_u_s_r_/_l_o_c_a_l and the last extracted file was
             _b_i_n_/_e_m_a_c_s.
             %%FF      Expands to the last filename extracted (as specified), in
                     the example case _b_i_n_/_e_m_a_c_s
             %%DD      Expand to the current directory prefix, as set with @@ccwwdd,
                     in the example case _/_u_s_r_/_l_o_c_a_l.
             %%BB      Expand to the (basename) of the fully qualified filename,
                     that is the current directory prefix, plus the last file-
                     spec, minus the trailing filename.  In the example case,
                     that would be _/_u_s_r_/_l_o_c_a_l_/_b_i_n.
             %%ff      Expand to the (filename) part of the fully qualified
                     name, or the converse of %%BB, being in the example case,
                     _e_m_a_c_s.
     @@uunneexxeecc _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
             Execute _c_o_m_m_a_n_d as part of the deinstallation process.  Expansion
             of special %% sequences is the same as for @@eexxeecc.  This command is
             not executed during the package add, as @@eexxeecc is, but rather when
             the package is deleted.  This is useful for deleting links and
             other ancillary files that were created as a result of adding the
             package, but not directly known to the package's table of con-
             tents (and hence not automatically removable).  The advantage of
             using @@uunneexxeecc over a deinstallation script is that you can use
             the (special sequence expansion) to get at files regardless of
             where they've been potentially redirected (see --pp).
     @@mmooddee _m_o_d_e
             Set default permission for all subsequently extracted files to
             _m_o_d_e.  Format is the same as that used by the cchhmmoodd command
             (well, considering that it's later handed off to it, that's no
             surprise).  Use without an arg to set back to default (extrac-
             tion) permissions.
     @@ooppttiioonn _o_p_t_i_o_n
             Set internal package options, the only two currently supported
             ones being _e_x_t_r_a_c_t_-_i_n_-_p_l_a_c_e, which tells the pkg_add command not
             to extract the package's tarball into a staging area but rather
             directly into the target hierarchy (this is typically meant to be
             used only by distributions or other special package types), and
             _p_r_e_s_e_r_v_e, which tells pkg_add to move any existing files out of
             the way, preserving the previous contents (which are also resur-
             rected on pkg_delete, so caveat emptor).
     @@oowwnneerr _u_s_e_r
             Set default ownership for all subsequently extracted files to
             _u_s_e_r.  Use without an arg to set back to default (extraction)
             ownership.
     @@ggrroouupp _g_r_o_u_p
             Set default group ownership for all subsequently extracted files
             to _g_r_o_u_p.  Use without an arg to set back to default (extraction)
             group ownership.
     @@ccoommmmeenntt _s_t_r_i_n_g
             Imbed a comment in the packing list.  Useful in trying to docu-
             ment some particularly hairy sequence that may trip someone up
             later.
     @@iiggnnoorree
             Used internally to tell extraction to ignore the next file (don't
             copy it anywhere), as it's used for some special purpose.
     @@iiggnnoorree__iinnsstt
             Similar to @@iiggnnoorree, but the ignoring of the next file is delayed
             one evaluation cycle.  This makes it possible to use this direc-
             tive in the _p_a_c_k_i_n_g_l_i_s_t file, so you can pack a specialized
             datafile in with a distribution for your install script (or some-
             thing) yet have the installer ignore it.
     @@nnaammee _n_a_m_e
             Set the name of the package.  This is mandatory and is usually
             put at the top.  This name is potentially different than the name
             of the file it came in, and is used when keeping track of the
             package for later deinstallation.  Note that ppkkgg__ccrreeaattee will
             derive this field from the package name and add it automatically
             if none is given.
     @@ddiirrrrmm _n_a_m_e
             Declare directory _n_a_m_e to be deleted at deinstall time.  By
             default, directories created by a package installation are not
             deleted when the package is deinstalled; this provides an
             explicit directory cleanup method.  This directive should appear
             at the end of the package list.  If more than one @@ddiirrrrmm direc-
             tives are used, the directories are removed in the order speci-
             fied.  The _n_a_m_e directory will not be removed unless it is empty.
     @@mmttrreeee _n_a_m_e
             Declare _n_a_m_e as an mtree(8) input file to be used at install time
             (see --mm above).  Only the first @@mmttrreeee directive is honored.
     @@ddiissppllaayy _n_a_m_e
             Declare _n_a_m_e as the file to be displayed at install time (see --DD
             above).
     @@ppkkggddeepp _p_k_g_n_a_m_e
             Declare a dependency on the _p_k_g_n_a_m_e package.  The _p_k_g_n_a_m_e package
             must be installed before this package may be installed, and this
             package must be deinstalled before the _p_k_g_n_a_m_e package is dein-
             stalled.  Multiple @@ppkkggddeepp directives may be used if the package
             depends on multiple other packages.
     @@bbllddddeepp _p_k_g_n_a_m_e
             Declare that this package was built with the exact version of
             _p_k_g_n_a_m_e (since the @@ppkkggddeepp directive may contain wildcards or
             relational package version information).
     @@ppkkggccffll _p_k_g_c_f_l_n_a_m_e
             Declare a conflict with the _p_k_g_c_f_l_n_a_m_e package, as the two pack-
             ages contain references to the same files, and so cannot co-exist
             on the same system.

     Hard links between files in a distribution must be bracketed by @@ccwwdd
     directives in order to be preserved as hard links when the package is
     extracted.  They additionally must not end up being split between ttaarr
     invocations due to exec argument-space limitations (this depends on the
     value returned by ssyyssccoonnff(___S_C___A_R_G___M_A_X)).
