.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
formats text messages to not overflow the terminal's width, and optionally
adds a prefix string to them.
Messages can be fed through the standard input or through multiple
arguments; in the latter case, all of them are concatenated as if they were
separated by a single space.
Different lines (those separated by a new-line character) are treated as
different paragraphs and thus formatted accordingly.
.Pp
In the first synopsis form,
.Nm
formats the message to not overflow the terminal's width.
The message is supposed to start at column 0.
.Pp
In the second synopsis form,
.Nm
also formats the message to not overflow the terminal's width, but it
appends a tag to the beginning of the string.
This tag may or may be not repeated on each line of the text; if it is
not repeated, the text is simply indented.
This synopsis form is useful to easily format two-column tables, being the
first one much shorter than the second one.
The message is supposed to start at column 0.
.Pp
In the third synopsis form,
.Nm
will print information about all supported options and their purpose.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width XlXlengthXX
.It Fl h
Shows a short summary of all available options and their purpose.
.It Fl l Ar length
Specifies the length in characters of te tag.
Useful if the tag is shorter than the desired length, which happens when
formatting two-column tables.
.It Fl r
Repeat the tag on each line.
Otherwise it is only shown on the first one, and all others are indented
appropriately using whitespace.
.It Fl t Ar tag
Specifies the tag to use
