.Nd queries static configuration information of ATF
.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a utility that queries static configuration information of ATF.
Static configuration refers to all those values for settings that
were built into the ATF binaries at build time.
.Pp
In the first synopsis form,
.Nm
will print variable-value pairs for all built-in static variables if
no variable names are provided as arguments.
If any is provided, it will only print the variable-value pairs for
those variables.
The output of the utility does not use the
.Sq =
symbol to separate the variable name from its corresponding value in
an attempt to avoid sourcing the output in shell scripts or Makefiles.
If you need to do that, the
.Fl t
flag allows you to query the value of individual variables without any
surrounding text.
.Pp
In the second synopsis form,
.Nm
will print information about all supported options and their purpose.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl h
Shows a short summary of all available options and their purpose.
.It Fl t
Changes the output of the utility to show the variable values, one
per line, without the variable names.
.El
.Ss Static configuration variables
The following list describes all the variables that are part of ATF's
static configuration:
.Bl -tag -width atfXpkgdatadirXX
.It Va atf_confdir
The path to the directory that contains the system-wide configuration
files for ATF.
.It Va atf_libexecdir
The path to the directory that contains the auxiliary utilities of ATF,
used internally by the public tools.
.It Va atf_pkgdatadir
The path to the directory that contains the files that form the ATF's
shell-scripting library.
.It Va atf_shell
The path to the shell interpreter that will be used by ATF.
.It Va atf_workdir
The path to the temporary directory that the utilities and the test
programs will use to store temporary files in.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
Every variable that is part of the static configuration can be
overridden at run-time by defining an environment variable.
This environment variable has the exact same name as the one shown by
.Nm
except that the name is all composed of uppercase letters.
.Pp
The recognized environment variables are:
.Bl -tag -width ATFXPKGDATADIRXX
.It Ev ATF_CONFDIR
Overrides the built-in value of
.Va atf_confdir .
.It Ev ATF_LIBEXECDIR
Overrides the built-in value of
.Va atf_libexecdir .
.It Ev ATF_PKGDATADIR
Overrides the built-in value of
.Va atf_pkgdatadir .
.It Ev ATF_SHELL
Overrides the built-in value of
.Va atf_shell .
.It Ev ATF_WORKDIR
Overrides the built-in value of
.Va atf_workdir .
