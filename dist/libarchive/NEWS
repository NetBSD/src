Jul 13, 2007: libarchive 2.2.5 released

Jul 12, 2007: libarchive 2.2.4 released

May 26, 2007: libarchive 2.2.3 released
May 26, 2007: Fix memory leaks in ZIP reader and shar writer, add some
	missing system headers to archive_entry.h, dead code cleanup
	from Colin Percival, more tests for gzip/bzip2, fix an
	EOF anomaly in bzip2 decompression.

May 12, 2007: libarchive 2.2.2 released
May 12, 2007: Fix archive_write_disk permission restore by cloning
	entry passed into write_header so that permission info is
	still available at finish_entry time.  (archive_read_extract()
	worked okay because it held onto the passed-in entry, but
	direct consumers of archive_write_disk would break).  This
	required fixing archive_entry_clone(), which now works and has
	a reasonably complete test case.
May 10, 2007: Skeletal cpio implementation.

May 06, 2007: libarchive 2.2.1 released
May 06, 2007: Flesh out a lot more of test_entry.c so as to catch
	problems such as the device node breakage before releasing <sigh>.
May 05, 2007: Fix a bad bug introduced in 2.1.9 that broke device
	node entries in tar archives.
May 03, 2007: Move 'struct stat' out of archive_entry core as well.
	This removes some portability headaches and fixes a bunch
	of corner cases that arise when manipulating archives on
	dissimilar systems.

Apr 30, 2007: libarchive 2.1.10 released
Apr 31, 2007: Minor code cleanup.

Apr 24, 2007: libarchive 2.1.9 released
Apr 24, 2007: Fix some recently-introduced problems with libraries
	(Just let automake handle it and it all works much better.)
	Finish isolating major()/minor()/makedev() in archive_entry.c.

Apr 23, 2007: libarchive 2.1.8 released
Apr 23, 2007: Minor fixes found from building on MacOS X

Apr 22, 2007: libarchive 2.1.7 released
Apr 22, 2007: Eliminated all uses of 'struct stat' from the
	format readers/writers.  This should improve portability;
	'struct stat' is now only used in archive_entry and in
	code that actually touches the disk.

Apr 17, 2007: libarchive 2.1.6 released
	Libarchive now compiles and passes all tests on Interix.

Apr 16, 2007: libarchive 2.1.5 released

Apr 15, 2007: libarchive 2.1b2 released
Apr 15, 2007: New libarchive_internals.3 documentation of internal APIs.
	Not complete, but should prove helpful.
Apr 15, 2007: Experimental "read_compress_program" and "write_compress_program"
	for using libarchive with external compression.  Not yet
	well tested, and likely has portability issues.  Feedback
	appreciated.

Apr 14, 2007: libarchive 2.0.31 released
Apr 14, 2007: More fixes for Interix, more 'ar' work

Apr 14, 2007: libarchive 2.0.30 released
Apr 13, 2007: libarchive now enforces trailing '/' on dirs
	written to tar archives

Apr 11, 2007: libarchive 2.0.29 released
Apr 11, 2007: Make it easier to statically configure for different platforms.
Apr 11, 2007: Updated config.guess, config.sub, libtool

Apr 06, 2007: libarchive 2.0.28 released
Apr 06, 2007: 'ar' format read/write support thanks to Kai Wang.

Apr 01, 2007: libarchive 2.0.27 released
Mar 31, 2007: Several minor fixes from Colin Percival and Joerg Sonnenberger.

Mar 12, 2007: libarchive 2.0.25 released
Mar 12, 2007: Fix broken --unlink flag.

Mar 11, 2007: libarchive 2.0.24 released
Mar 10, 2007: Correct an ACL blunder that causes any ACL with an entry
    that refers to a non-existent user or group to not be restored correctly.
    The fix both makes the parser more tolerant (so that archives created
    with the buggy ACLs can be read now) and corrects the ACL formatter.
Mar 10, 2007: More work on test portability to Linux.

Mar 10, 2007: libarchive 2.0.22 released
Mar 10, 2007: Header cleanups; added linux/fs.h, removed
    some unnecessary headers, added #include guards in bsdtar.
    If you see any obvious compile failures from this, let me know.
Mar 10, 2007: Work on bsdtar test scripts: not yet robust enough
    to enable as part of "make check", but getting better.
Mar 10, 2007: libarchive now returns ARCHIVE_FAILED when
    a header write fails in a way that only affects this item.
    Less bad than ARCHIVE_FATAL, but worse than ARCHIVE_WARN.

Mar 07, 2007: libarchive 2.0.21 released
Mar 07, 2007: Add some ACL tests (only for the system-independent
    portion of the ACL support for now).
Mar 07, 2007: tar's ability to read ACLs off disk got
    turned off for FreeBSD; re-enable it.  (ACL restores and
    libarchive support for storing/reading ACLs from pax
    archives was unaffected.)

Mar 02, 2007: libarchive 2.0.20 released
Mar 2, 2007:  It's not perfect, but it's pretty good.
    Libarchive 2.0 is officially out of beta.

Feb 28, 2007: libarchive 2.0b17 released
Feb 27, 2007: Make the GID restore checks more robust by checking
    whether the current user has too few or too many privileges.

Feb 26, 2007: libarchive 2.0b15 released
Feb 26, 2007: Don't lose symlinks when extracting from ISOs.
    Thanks to Diego "Flameeyes" Pettenò for telling me about the
    broken testcase on Gentoo that (finally!) led me to the cause
    of this long-standing bug.

Feb 26, 2007: libarchive 2.0b14 released
Feb 26, 2007: Fix a broken test on platforms that lack lchmod().

Feb 25, 2007: libarchive 2.0b13 released
Feb 25, 2007: Empty archives were being written as empty files,
    without a proper end-of-archive marker.  Fixed.

Feb 23, 2007: libarchive 2.0b12 released
Feb 22, 2007: Basic security checks added: _EXTRACT_SECURE_NODOTDOT
    and _EXTRACT_SECURE_SYMLINK.  These checks used to be in bsdtar,
    but they belong down in libarchive where they can be used by
    other tools and where they can be better optimized.

Feb 11, 2007: libarchive 2.0b11 released
Feb 10, 2007: Fixed a bunch of errors in libarchive's handling
    of EXTRACT_PERM and EXTRACT_OWNER, especially relating
    to SUID and SGID bits.

Jan 31, 2007: libarchive 2.0b9 released
Jan 31, 2007: Added read support for "empty" archives as a
    distinct archive format.  Bsdtar uses this to handle, e.g.,
    "touch foo.tar; tar -rf foo.tar"

Jan 22, 2007: libarchive 2.0b6 released
Jan 22, 2007: archive_write_disk API is now in place.  It provides
    a finer-grained interface than archive_read_extract.  In particular,
    you can use it to create objects on disk without having an archive
    around (just feed it archive_entry objects describing what you
    want to create), you can override the uname/gname-to-uid/gid lookups
    (minitar uses this to avoid getpwXXX() and getgrXXX() bloat).

Jan 09, 2007: libarchive 2.0a3 released
Jan 9, 2007: archive_extract is now much better; it handles the
    most common cases with a minimal number of system calls.
    Some features still need a lot of testing, especially corner
    cases involving objects that already exist on disk.   I expect
    the next round of API overhaul will simplify building test cases.
Jan 9, 2007: a number of fixes thanks to Colin Percival, especially
    corrections to the skip() framework and handling of large files.
Jan 9, 2007: Fixes for large ISOs.  The code should correctly handle
    very large ISOs with entries up to 4G.   Thanks to Robert Sciuk
    for pointing out these issues.

Sep 05, 2006: libarchive 1.3.1 released
Sep 5, 2006: Bump version to 1.3 for new I/O wrappers.
Sep 4, 2006: New memory and FILE read/write wrappers.
Sep 4, 2006: libarchive test harness is now minimally functional;
    it's located a few minor bugs in error-handling logic

Aug 17, 2006: libarchive 1.2.54 released
Aug 17, 2006: Outline ABI changes for libarchive 2.0; these
   are protected behind #ifdef's until I think I've found everything
   that needs to change.
Aug 17, 2006: Fix error-handling in archive_read/write_close()
   They weren't returning any errors before.
Aug 17, 2006: Fix recursive-add logic to not trigger if it's not set
   Fixes a bug adding files when writing archive to pipe or when
   using archive_write_open() directly.
Jul 2006: New "skip" handling improves performance extracting
   single files from large uncompressed archives.

Mar 21, 2006: 1.2.52 released
Mar 21, 2006: Fix -p on platforms that don't have platform-specific
   extended attribute code.
Mar 20, 2006: Add NEWS file; fill in some older history from other
   files.  I'll try to keep this file up-to-date from now on.

OLDER NEWS SUMMARIES
