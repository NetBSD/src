#	In the following text, the symbol '#' introduces
#	a comment, which continues from that symbol until 
#	the end of the line. A plain comment line has a
#	whitespace character following the comment indicator.
#	There are also special comment lines defined below. 
#	A special comment will always have a non-whitespace 
#	character in column 2.
#
#	A blank line should be ignored.
#
#	The following table shows the corrections that must
#	be applied to compute International Atomic Time (TAI)
#	from the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) values that
#	are transmitted by almost all time services.
#
#	The first column shows an epoch as a number of seconds
#	since 1900.0 and the second column shows the number of
#	seconds that must be added to UTC to compute TAI for
#	any timestamp at or after that epoch. The value on 
#	each line is valid from the indicated initial instant
#	until the epoch given on the next one or indefinitely 
#	into the future if there is no next line.
#	(The comment on each line shows the representation of
#	the corresponding initial epoch in the usual 
#	day-month-year format. The epoch always begins at
#	00:00:00 UTC on the indicated day. See Note 5 below.)
#	
#	Important notes:
#
#	1. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is often referred to
#	as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The GMT time scale is no
#	longer used, and the use of GMT to designate UTC is
#	discouraged.
#
#	2. The UTC time scale is realized by many national 
#	laboratories and timing centers. Each laboratory
#	identifies its realization with its name: Thus
#	UTC(NIST), UTC(USNO), etc. The differences among
#	these different realizations are typically on the
#	order of a few nanoseconds (i.e., 0.000 000 00x s)
#	and can be ignored for many purposes. These differences
#	are tabulated in Circular T, which is published monthly
#	by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures
#	(BIPM). See www.bipm.fr for more information.
#
#	3. The current defintion of the relationship between UTC 
#	and TAI dates from 1 January 1972. A number of different 
#	time scales were in use before than epoch, and it can be 
#	quite difficult to compute precise timestamps and time 
#	intervals in those "prehistoric" days. For more information,
#	consult:
#
#		The Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical
#		Ephemeris.
#	or
#		Terry Quinn, "The BIPM and the Accurate Measurement
#		of Time," Proc. of the IEEE, Vol. 79, pp. 894-905,
#		July, 1991.
#
#	4.  The insertion of leap seconds into UTC is currently the
#	responsibility of the International Earth Rotation Service,
#	which is located at the Paris Observatory: 
#
#	Central Bureau of IERS
#	61, Avenue de l'Observatoire
#	75014 Paris, France.
#
#	Leap seconds are announced by the IERS in its Bulletin C
#
#	See hpiers.obspm.fr or www.iers.org for more details.
#
#	All national laboratories and timing centers use the
#	data from the BIPM and the IERS to construct their
#	local realizations of UTC.
#
#	Although the definition also includes the possibility
#	of dropping seconds ("negative" leap seconds), this has 
#	never been done and is unlikely to be necessary in the 
#	foreseeable future.
#
#	5. If your system keeps time as the number of seconds since
#	some epoch (e.g., NTP timestamps), then the algorithm for
#	assigning a UTC time stamp to an event that happens during a positive
#	leap second is not well defined. The official name of that leap 
#	second is 23:59:60, but there is no way of representing that time 
#	in these systems. 
#	Many systems of this type effectively stop the system clock for 
#	one second during the leap second and use a time that is equivalent 
#	to 23:59:59 UTC twice. For these systems, the corresponding TAI 
#	timestamp would be obtained by advancing to the next entry in the
#	following table when the time equivalent to 23:59:59 UTC
#	is used for the second time. Thus the leap second which
#	occurred on 30 June 1972 at 23:59:59 UTC would have TAI
#	timestamps computed as follows:
#
#	...
#	30 June 1972 23:59:59 (2287785599, first time):	TAI= UTC + 10 seconds
#	30 June 1972 23:59:60 (2287785599,second time):	TAI= UTC + 11 seconds
#	1  July 1972 00:00:00 (2287785600)		TAI= UTC + 11 seconds
#	...
#
#	If your system realizes the leap second by repeating 00:00:00 UTC twice
#	(this is possible but not usual), then the advance to the next entry
#	in the table must occur the second time that a time equivlent to 
#	00:00:00 UTC is used. Thus, using the same example as above:
#
#	...
#       30 June 1972 23:59:59 (2287785599):		TAI= UTC + 10 seconds
#       30 June 1972 23:59:60 (2287785600, first time):	TAI= UTC + 10 seconds
#       1  July 1972 00:00:00 (2287785600,second time):	TAI= UTC + 11 seconds
#	...
#
#	in both cases the use of timestamps based on TAI produces a smooth
#	time scale with no discontinuity in the time interval.
#
#	This complexity would not be needed for negative leap seconds (if they 
#	are ever used). The UTC time would skip 23:59:59 and advance from 
#	23:59:58 to 00:00:00 in that case.  The TAI offset would decrease by 
#	1 second at the same instant.  This is a much easier situation to deal 
#	with, since the difficulty of unambiguously representing the epoch 
#	during the leap second does not arise.

#	Last Update of leap second values:   11 January 2012
#
#	The following line shows this last update date in NTP timestamp 
#	format. This is the date on which the most recent change to
#	the leap second data was added to the file. This line can
#	be identified by the unique pair of characters in the first two 
#	columns as shown below.
#
#$	 3535228800
#
#	The NTP timestamps are in units of seconds since the NTP epoch,
#	which is 1900.0. The Modified Julian Day number corresponding
#	to the NTP time stamp, X, can be computed as 
#
#	X/86400 + 15020
#
#	where the first term converts seconds to days and the second 
#	term adds the MJD corresponding to 1900.0. The integer portion
#	of the result is the integer MJD for that day, and any remainder
#	is the time of day, expressed as the fraction of the day since 0 
#	hours UTC. The conversion from day fraction to seconds or to
#	hours, minutes, and seconds may involve rounding or truncation,
#	depending on the method used in the computation.
#
#	The data in this file will be updated periodically as new leap 
#	seconds are announced. In addition to being entered on the line
#	above, the update time (in NTP format) will be added to the basic 
#	file name leap-seconds to form the name leap-seconds.<NTP TIME>.
#	In addition, the generic name leap-seconds.list will always point to 
#	the most recent version of the file.
#
#	This update procedure will be performed only when a new leap second
#	is announced. 
#
#	The following entry specifies the expiration date of the data
#	in this file in units of seconds since 1900.0.  This expiration date 
#	will be changed at least twice per year whether or not a new leap 
#	second is announced. These semi-annual changes will be made no
#	later than 1 June and 1 December of each year to indicate what
#	action (if any) is to be taken on 30 June and 31 December, 
#	respectively. (These are the customary effective dates for new
#	leap seconds.) This expiration date will be identified by a
#	unique pair of characters in columns 1 and 2 as shown below.
#	In the unlikely event that a leap second is announced with an 
#	effective date other than 30 June or 31 December, then this
#	file will be edited to include that leap second as soon as it is
#	announced or at least one month before the effective date
#	(whichever is later). 
#	If an announcement by the IERS specifies that no leap second is 
#	scheduled, then only the expiration date of the file will 
#	be advanced to show that the information in the file is still
#	current -- the update time stamp, the data and the name of the file 
#	will not change.

#	File expires on:  28 June 2014
