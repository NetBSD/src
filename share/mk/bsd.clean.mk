# __cleanuse is invoked with ${.ALLSRC} as the name of a variable
# (such as CLEANFILES or CLEANDIRFILES), or possibly a list of
# variable names.  ${.ALLSRC:@v@${${v}}@} will be the list of
# files to delete.  (We pass the variable name, e.g. CLEANFILES,
# instead of the file names, e.g. ${CLEANFILES}, because we don't
# want make to replace any of the file names with the result of
# searching .PATH.)
#
# If the list of files is empty, then the commands
# reduce to "true", with an "@" prefix to prevent echoing.
#
# The use of :M* is needed to handle the case that CLEANFILES
# or CLEANDIRFILES is not completely empty but contains spaces.
# This can easily happen when CLEANFILES or CLEANDIRFILES is set
# from other variables that happen to be empty.)
#
# The use of :Q is needed to handle the case that CLEANFILES
# or CLEANDIRFILES contains quoted strings, such as
# CLEANFILES = "filename with spaces".
