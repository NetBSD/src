.Bl -tag -width "include/" -compact
.It Pa dist/
Utilities.
Every utility has its own subdirectory,
where its source and Makefile are located.
.It Pa include/
Include headers.
Every group of header files has its own
subdirectory, where it and its
Makefile are located.
.It Pa lib/

.El
.It Pa compat/
A framework to (re)build the libraries
shipped with
.Nx
for different ABI than the default for
that platform.
.Bl -tag -width "compat/<arch1>/<arch2>/" -compact
.It Pa compat/<arch1>/<arch2>/
Every
.Pa compat/<arch1>/<arch2>/
directory contains a Makefile and a makefile
fragment for building an
.Pa <arch2>
compat libraries for
.Pa <arch1> .
E. g.,
.Pa compat/amd64/i386/
is where the 32-bit compat libraries for the
amd64 port are being built.
.It Pa compatsubdir.mk
The list of subdirectories (the libraries and
ld.elf_so) to build with this ABI.
.It Pa archdirs.mk
The list of subdirectories for each port.
.It Pa Makefile.compat

library and ld.elf_so linkage.

.El
.It Pa crypto/

export restrictions.
.Bl -tag -width "external/" -compact
.It Pa dist/

This is deprecated;
.Pa crypto/external/
should be used instead.
.It Pa external/
Original sources, grouped by license, and then

README's and various import helper scripts.
E. g.,
.Pa external/public-domain/
contains
sources licensed under Public Domain
license;
.Pa external/public-domain/sqlite/dist/
contains original sources;
.Pa external/public-domain/sqlite/bin/ ,
.Pa external/public-domain/sqlite/lib/
and
.Pa external/public-domain/sqlite/

into
.Pa tests/
once they are migrated to the
.Xr atf 7
test framework.
.It Pa rescue/
Makefiles for copying utilities to
.Pa /rescue .
.It Pa share/
Source for utilities/files in

.It Pa stand/
Source for several standalone programs that aren't used by
.Nx
currently.
.It Pa sys/
Header files that get installed into
.Pa /usr/include/sys .
.It Pa ufs/
UFS file system driver.
.It Pa uvm/
Virtual memory manager.
.El
.It Pa tests/
Source for test programs in
.Pa /usr/tests .
These tests use the
.Xr atf 7
test framework.
For library routines, including system calls, the
directory structure of the tests should follow the
directory structure of the real source tree.
For instance, interfaces available via the C
library should follow:
.Pa src/lib/libc/gen -> Pa src/tests/lib/libc/gen ,
.Pa src/lib/libc/sys -> Pa src/tests/lib/libc/sys ,
etc.
Equivalently, all tests for userland utilities
should try to follow their location in the source tree.
If this can not be satisfied, the tests for
a utility should be located under the directory to which
the utility is installed.
Thus, a test for
.Xr env 1
should go to
.Pa src/tests/usr.bin/env .
Likewise, a test for
.Xr tcpdump 8
should be in
.Pa src/tests/usr.sbin/tcpdump ,
even though the source code for the program is located under
.Pa src/external .
.It Pa tools/
Reachover build structure for the host build tools.
Every utility has its own directory, where its Makefile
is located.
.It Pa x11/
Reachover build structure for X11R7; the source is in
.Pa X11SRCDIR .
The directory structure copies the system\'s;
every directory contains a Makefile.
