.Sh DESCRIPTION
A standard
.Nx
installation has the following user group names:
.\" These are currently sorted by gid; perhaps they should be sorted
.\" lexicographically by name instead.
.Bl -tag -width ".Em _tcpdump"
.It Em wheel
Users authorized to elevate themselves to the super-user privileges of
the root user, meaning uid\~0.
Normally the
.Em wheel
group has gid\~0.
.Pp
Users who are not in the group
.Em wheel
are never allowed by
.Xr su 1
to gain root privileges.
.It Em daemon
Used by the set-group-id
.Pq Xr setuid 7
programs
.Xr lpq 1 ,
.Xr lpr 1 ,
and
.Xr lprm 1 .
.\" Unclear why.  Maybe used to be used by uucp stuff too, since
.\" /var/spool/lock ownership is uucp:daemon?
.It Em sys
Historic group.
Unused in modern
.Nx .
.It Em tty
Used by the set-group-id
.Pq Xr setuid 7
programs
.Xr wall 1
and
.Xr write 1
to allow users to send messages to another tty even if they don't own
it.
Static tty device nodes in
.Pa /dev
are all in the group
.Em tty ,
and the
.Xr mount_ptyfs 8
program passes the gid of the
.Em tty
group to the kernel so that all nodes in
.Pa /dev/pts
or equivalent are in the group too.
.It Em operator
Users authorized to take backups of disk devices and shut down the
machine.
.Pp
The disk device nodes in
.Pa /dev
such as
.Pa /dev/rwd0a
are in the group
.Em operator
and group-readable so users in the group can read from disk devices,
for example with
.Xr dump 8 .
The tape device nodes in
.Pa /dev
such as
.Pa /dev/rst0
are in the group
.Em operator
and are both group-readable and group-writable so users in the group
can write to tape devices.
.Pp
The
.Xr shutdown 8
program is executable only by root and members of the
.Em operator
group.
.It Em mail
Historic group.
Unused in modern
.Nx .
.\" Is this true?  Hard to grep for this in src...
.It Em bin
Historic group.
Unused in modern
.Nx .
.It Em wsrc
Historic group.
Unused in modern
.Nx .
.\" Actually it seems to be used in the set lists somehow, but it's
.\" unclear to me how what the significance is.
.It Em maildrop
Used by the set-group-id
.Pq Xr setuid 7
programs
.Xr postdrop 1
and
.Xr postqueue 1
to submit to and examine the
.Xr postfix 1
mail queue at
.Pa /var/spool/postfix/maildrop
and
.Pa /var/spool/postfix/public .
.It Em postfix
Primary group for the
.Em postfix
pseudo-user used by the
.Xr postfix 1
mail transfer agent.
.\" Why are various subdirectories of /var/spool/postfix owned by
.\" postfix:wheel and not postfix:postfix?
.It Em games
Used by various set-group-id
.Pq Xr setuid 7
games to maintain high-scores files and other common files in
.Pa /var/games .
.It Em named
Primary group for the
.Em named
pseudo-user used by the
.Xr named 8
DNS nameserver daemon.
.It Em ntpd
Primary group for the
.Em ntpd
pseudo-user used by the
.Xr ntpd 8
network time protocol daemon.
.It Em sshd
Primary group for the
.Em sshd

.Xr sshd 8
secure shell daemon.
.It Em _pflogd
Primary group for the
.Em _pflogd
pseudo-user used by the
.Xr pflogd 8
log daemon with the
.Xr pf 4
packet filter.
.It Em _rwhod
Primary group for the
.Em _rwhod
pseudo-user used by the

available for the administrator's interpretation.
.It Em _proxy
Primary group for the
.Em _proxy
pseudo-user used by the

and
.Xr tftp-proxy 8
proxy daemons with packet filters such as
.Xr pf 4
or
.Xr ipnat 4 .
.It Em _timedc
Primary group for the
.Em _timedc
pseudo-user used by the
.Xr timedc 8
tool to communicate with the
.Xr timed 8
time server daemon.
.It Em _sdpd
Primary group for the
.Em _sdpd
pseudo-user used by the
.Xr sdpd 8
Bluetooth service discovery protocol daemon.
.It Em _httpd
Primary group for the
.Em _httpd

.It Em nvmm
Users authorized to use the

.It Em nobody

Modern practice is to assign to each different daemon its own separate

does not compromise all the other daemons.

.\" Why?

.It Em users
Regular users, in contrast to staff or guest users.
.Pp
Default primary group for new users, as set in the default
.Xr usermgmt.conf 5

.Xr useradd 8 .
.It Em dialer
Users authorized to make outgoing modem calls.
Unused in modern
