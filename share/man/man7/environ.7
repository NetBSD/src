and
.Xr audiorecord 1 .
.It Ev BLOCKSIZE
The size of the block units used by several commands, most notably
.Xr df 1 ,
.Xr du 1
and
.Xr ls 1 .
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
may be specified in units of a byte by specifying a number,
in units of a kilobyte by specifying a number followed by
.Ql K
or
.Ql k ,
in units of a megabyte by specifying a number followed by
.Ql M
or
.Ql m
and in units of a gigabyte by specifying a number followed
by
.Ql G

.Xr lpr 1 ,
.Xr lpq 1 ,
and
.Xr lprm 1 .
.It Ev RCMD_CMD

.Xr rcmd 1 .
.It Ev SHELL
The full pathname of the user's login shell.
.It Ev TERM
The kind of terminal for which output is to be prepared.
This information is used by commands, such as
.Xr nroff 1

which may exploit special terminal capabilities.
See
.Pa /usr/share/misc/terminfo
.Pq Xr terminfo 5
for a list of terminal types.
.It Ev TERMCAP
The string describing the terminal in
.Ev TERM ,
or, if it begins with a
.Ql / ,
the name of the termcap file.
This is only checked if
.Ev TERMINFO
is not set.
.It Ev TERMINFO
The string describing the terminal in
.Ev TERM ,
or, if it begins with a
.Ql / ,
the name of the terminfo file.
.It Ev TIMEFORMAT
A
.Xr strftime 3
format string that may be used by programs such as
.Xr dump 8
for formatting timestamps.
.It Ev TMPDIR
The directory in which to store temporary files.
Most applications use either

or
.Pa /var/tmp .
Setting this variable will make them use another directory.

Further names may be placed in the environment by the
.Ic export
command and
.Ar name=value
arguments in
.Xr sh 1 ,
or by the
.Ic setenv
command if you use
.Xr csh 1 .
It is unwise to change certain
.Xr sh 1
variables that are frequently exported by
.Pa .profile
files, such as
.Ev MAIL ,
.Ev PS1 ,
.Ev PS2 ,
and
.Ev IFS ,
unless you know what you are doing.
