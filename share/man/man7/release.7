.Sh NAME
.Nm release
.Nd layout of NetBSD releases and snapshots
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This document describes the layout of
.Nx
releases and snapshots.
This layout should be consistent between FTP servers and CD-ROMs,
except possibly the path that leads to the release hierarchy.
.Pp
In this document, the following special words have these definitions:
.Bl -tag -width "<machine_arch>"
.It Aq Em machine
The platform for which the release was built, corresponding to the
.Em hw.machine
sysctl variable, e.g.,
.Em i386
or
.Em amiga .
.It Aq Em machine_arch
The architecture for which a particular installation set was built,
corresponding to the
.Em hw.machine_arch
sysctl variable, e.g.,
.Em i386
or
.Em m68k .
.It Aq Em rel
The release version number.
.El
.Pp
All
.Sy README
files are descriptions of the various files in directories that have
.Dq non-standard
contents.
There may also be a
.Sy README
file at the top-level,
describing who built the snapshot and under what circumstances
.Po e.g., whether it's an official
.Nx
snapshot, or not
.Pc .
.Pp
All
.Sy MD5
files are MD5 digests for the various files in that directory, in the
format produced by the command:
.Sy cksum -a MD5 Aq Sy file .
.Pp
All
.Sy SHA512
files are SHA512 digests for the various files in that directory, in the
format produced by the command:
.Sy cksum -a SHA512 Aq Sy file .
.Pp
The SHA512 digest is safer, but MD5 checksums are provided so that a wider
range of operating systems can check the integrity of the release files.
.Pp
Files that end in
.Sy .tgz
are gzipped tar archives.
This is used in lieu of
.Sy .tar.gz
because the software used to download the sets may incorrectly auto-unpack
files ending in
.Sy .gz
and to accommodate systems which only support 3 character extensions
to file names.
.Pp
All tar archives are relative to the target's
.Sy /
directory, and
.Em do not
include the leading
.Dq / .
.Pp
The root of the release hierarchy may be the root directory of a
CD-ROM, but in all other cases it should be
.Sm off
.Xo
.Sy .../NetBSD-
.Aq Em rel
.Sy / .
.Xc
.Sm on
.Pp
The root of the release hierarchy should contain the following
files and subdirectories:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "<machine>"
.It Sy images/
Image files intended for use in installing
.Nx .
There are different types of images for different platforms, and sometimes
multiple different image types for a single platform.
.Pp
Images in this directory, unlike images in the
.Sm off
.Xo
.Sy .../NetBSD-
.Aq Em rel
.Sy /
.Aq Em machine
.Sy /installation/\\*/
.Xc
.Sm on
directories, contain file systems that
have an internal layout that corresponds to
a complete release for a given machine type.
If built with
.Dq iso-image-source ,
then it will also contain a
.Dq source
directory.
These images are usually bootable.
.Bl -tag -width "NetBSD-<rel>-<machine>.iso"
.It Sy MD5
.It Sy SHA512
.It Sy NetBSD- Ns Ao Em rel Ac Ns Sy - Ns Ao Em machine Ac Ns Sy .iso

in

or created with
.Dq ./build.sh ... iso-image-source ...
after a

.It Sy NetBSD- Ns Ao Em rel Ac Ns Sy - Ns Ao Em machine Ac Ns Sy -install.img.gz

.El
.
.It Sy shared/
Files shared by two or more machine types.
.Bl -tag -width "<machine_arch>"
.It Ao Em machine_arch Ac Ns Pa /
Files which may be shared by all systems of the same

.Aq Em rel
.Sy /shared/
.Aq Em machine_arch
.Sy /
.Xc
.Sm on
with symbolic links pointing to these files from the
.Aq Em machine
subdirectory.
.It Sy ALL/
Files which are completely machine-independent will be
located in
.Sy .../NetBSD- Ns Ao Em rel Ac Ns Sy /shared/ALL/
with symbolic links pointing to these files from the
.Aq Em machine
subdirectory.
.El
.
.It Sy source/
Source code of the operating system should be put into
.Sy .../NetBSD- Ns Ao Em rel Ac Ns Sy /source/
using the following layout:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "sets/"
.It Sy sets/
Sources for the various system sets.
.Bl -tag -width "sharesrc.tgz"
.It Sy MD5
