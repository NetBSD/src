.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
provides red-black trees.
A red-black tree is a binary search tree with the node color as an
extra attribute.
It fulfills a set of conditions:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
Every search path from the root to a leaf consists of the same number of
black nodes.
.It
Each red node (except for the root) has a black parent.
.It
Each leaf node is black.
.El
.Pp
Every operation on a red-black tree is bounded as O(lg n).
The maximum height of a red-black tree is 2lg (n+1).
.Sh TYPES
.Bl -tag -width compact
.It Vt rb_tree_t
A red-black tree.
.It Vt typedef signed int \
(* rbto_compare_nodes_fn)(void *, const void *, const void *);
The node-comparison operator.
Defines an ordering on nodes.
Returns a negative value if the first node precedes the second node.
Returns a positive value if the first node follows the second node.
Returns 0 if the first node and the second are identical according
to the ordering.
.It Vt typedef signed int \
(* rbto_compare_key_fn)(void *, const void *, const void *);
The node-key comparison operator.
Defines the order of nodes and keys.
Returns a negative value if the node precedes the key.
Returns a positive value if the node follows the key.
Returns 0 if the node is identical to the key according to the ordering.
.It Vt rb_tree_ops_t
Defines the operator for comparing two nodes in the same tree,
the operator for comparing a node in the tree with a key,
the offset of member
.Vt rb_node_t
within a node,
and the opaque context passed to the operators.
Members of
.Vt rb_tree_ops_t
are
.Bd -literal
        rbto_compare_nodes_fn rbto_compare_nodes;
        rbto_compare_key_fn rbto_compare_key;
        size_t rbto_node_offset;
        void *rbto_context;
.Ed
.It Vt rb_node_t
A node in a red-black tree has this structure as a member.
.El
.Sh FUNCTIONS
.Bl -tag -width compact
.It Fn rb_tree_init "rbt" "ops"
Initialize the red-black tree
.Fa rbt .
Let the comparison operators given by
.Fa ops
define the order of nodes in the tree for
the purposes of insertion, search, and iteration.
.Fn rb_tree_init
always succeeds.
.It Fn rb_tree_insert_node "rbt" "rb"
Insert the node
.Fa rb
into the tree
.Fa rbt .
Return inserted node on success,
already existing node on failure.
.It Fn rb_tree_remove_node "rbt" "rb"
Remove the node
.Fa rb
from the tree
.Fa rbt .
.It Fn rb_tree_find_node "rbt" "key"
Search the tree
.Fa rbt
for a node exactly matching
.Fa key .
If no such node is in the tree, return
.Dv NULL .
Otherwise, return the matching node.
.It Fn rb_tree_find_node_geq "rbt" "key"
Search the tree
.Fa rbt
for a node that exactly matches
.Fa key
and return it.
If no such node is present, return the first node following
.Fa key
or, if no such node is in the tree, return
.Dv NULL .
.It Fn rb_tree_find_node_leq "rbt" "key"
Search the tree
.Fa rbt
for a node that exactly matches
.Fa key
and return it.
If no such node is present, return the first node preceding
.Fa key
or, if no such node is in the tree, return
.Dv NULL .
.It Fn rb_tree_iterate "rbt" "rb" "direction"
If
.Fa direction
is
.Dv RB_DIR_LEFT ,
return the node in the tree
.Fa rbt
immediately preceding the node
.Fa rb
or, if
.Fa rb
is
.Dv NULL ,
return the last node in
.Fa rbt
or, if the tree is empty, return
.Dv NULL .
.Pp
If
.Fa direction
is
.Dv RB_DIR_RIGHT ,
return the node in the tree
.Fa rbt
immediately following the node
.Fa rb
or, if
.Fa rb
is
.Dv NULL ,
return the first node in
.Fa rbt
or, if the tree is empty, return
.Dv NULL .
