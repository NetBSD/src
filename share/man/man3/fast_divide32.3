.Sh NAME
.Nm fast_divide32 ,
.Nm fast_divide32_prepare ,
.Nm fast_remainder32
.Nd fast 32bit division and remainder
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/bitops.h
.Ft uint32_t
.Fn fast_divide32 "uint32_t v" "uint32_t div" "uint32_t m" "uint8_t s1" \
"uint8_t s2"
.Ft uint32_t
.Fn fast_remainder32 "uint32_t v" "uint32_t div" "uint32_t m" "uint8_t s1" \
"uint8_t s2"
.Ft void
.Fn fast_divide32_prepare "uint32_t div" "uint32_t *m" "uint8_t *s1" \
"uint8_t *s2"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm fast_divide32
and
.Nm fast_remainder32
functions compute the equivalent of
.Fa v / Fa div
and
.Fa v % Fa div
using optimised CPU instructions.
The constants
.Fa m ,
.Fa s1
and
.Fa s2
must first be preset for a given value of
.Fa div
with the
.Nm fast_divide32_prepare
function.
.Sh RATIONALE
These functions are useful for inner loops and other performance-sensitive
tasks.
The functions expand to code that is typically slightly larger than
a plain division instruction, but requires less time to execute.
The code for constant
.Fa div
arguments should be equivalent to the assembly created by GCC.
.Sh EXAMPLE
The following example computes q=a/b and r=a%b:
.Bd -literal
uint32_t a, b, q, r, m;
uint8_t s1, s2;

fast_divide32_prepare(b, &m, &s1, &s2);

q = fast_divide32(a, b, m, s1, s2);
r = fast_remainder32(a, b, m, s1, s2);
