.Sh NAME
.Nm intro
.Nd introduction to the system libraries
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This section provides an overview of the system libraries, their
functions, error returns and other common definitions and concepts.
Most of these functions are available from the standard C library,
.Em libc .
Other libraries, such as the math library,
.Em libm ,
must be indicated at compile time with the
.Fl l
option of the compiler.
.\" .Pp
.\" A subset of the
.\" .Xr libc functions
.\" are available from Fortran;
.\" they are described separately in
.\" .Xr intro 3f .
.Pp
The various system libraries supplied in
.Nx
(followed by the linker flags) are:
.Bl -tag -width "libc (-lc)"
.It Em libasn1 Pq Fl l Ns Ar asn1
The abstract syntax notation (ASN) library provides routines for the
specification of abstract data types.
.It Em libbz2 Pq Fl l Ns Ar bz2
Block-sorting compressor library providing routines for fast and
efficient compression.
.It Em libc Pq Fl l Ns Ar c
The standard C library.
When using the C compiler
.Xr cc 1 ,
it is not necessary to supply the linker flag
.Fl l Ns Ar c
for these functions.
There are several subsystems included inside
.Em libc :
.Bl -tag -width "XXXXXX"
.It standard I/O routines
see
.Xr stdio 3
.It database routines
see
.Xr db 3
.It bit operators
see
.Xr bitstring 3
.It string operators

.Xr string 3
.It character tests and character operators
.It Tn encryption and hash routines

The common error description library.
See
.Xr com_err 3 .
.It Em libcompat Pq Fl l Ns Ar compat
Functions which are obsolete but are available for compatibility with
.Bx 4.3 .
In particular, a number of system call interfaces provided in previous
releases of
.Bx
have been included for source code compatibility.
Use of these routines should, for the most part, be avoided.
The manual page entry
for each compatibility routine indicates the proper interface to use.
.It Em libcrypt Pq Fl l Ns Ar crypt
The crypt library.
See
.Xr crypt 3 .
