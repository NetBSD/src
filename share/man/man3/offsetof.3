.Sh NAME
.Nm offsetof
.Nd offset of a structure member
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stddef.h
.Ft size_t
.Fn offsetof "type" "member"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn offsetof
macro expands to an integer constant expression of type
.Ft size_t
and yields the offset,
in bytes, of the field
.Ar member
from the start of the structure
.Ar type .
.Pp
A compiler error will result if
.Ar member
is not aligned to a byte boundary (i.e. it is a bit-field).
.Sh EXAMPLES
Regardless of the architecture and the
.Tn ABI ,
the following example prints the value zero for the variable
.Va x .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct example {
	double	x;
	int	y;
	char	z;
};

size_t x, y, z;

x = offsetof(struct example, x);
y = offsetof(struct example, y);
z = offsetof(struct example, z);

(void)printf("%zu %zu %zu\en", x, y, z);
