.Nm cdefs
.Nd common definitions and macros
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/cdefs.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.In sys/cdefs.h
header includes some common definitions and macros
typical to the C language conventions of
.Nx .
Among these are:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
Certain C language properties and definitions that
are versioned according to the support in compilers.
Examples include the
.Em __func__
keyword and the
.Em restrict
type qualifier from
.Tn C99 .
.It
Macros and definitions specific to compilers, preprocessors, and linkers; see
.Xr __CONCAT 3 ,
.Xr __UNCONST 3 ,
.Xr __USE 3 ,
.Xr __insn_barrier 3 ,
and
.Xr attribute 3 .
.It
Utility macros provided for convenience; see
.Xr __arraycount 3
and
.Xr bits 3 .
.El
.Pp
The header also contains the
.Fn __RCSID
and
.Fn __KERNEL_RCSID
macros used for version control system
.Pq Tn VCS
identifiers.
Thus, all
.Nx
source code files typically include
.In sys/cdefs.h ,
included as the first thing right after any possible copyright texts;
.Bd -literal -offset indent
