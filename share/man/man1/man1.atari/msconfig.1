.Sh NAME
.Nm msconfig
.Nd Show or change the middle button emulation mode
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl f Ar mouse-device
.Op Ar on|off
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to modify or examine the state of the middle-button emulation mode of
the
.Nx Ns Tn /Atari
mouse driver.
When
.Nm
is used without the
.Ar on|off
parameter, it prints the current state of the emulation mode.
The default mouse device is
.Pa /dev/mouse .
This can be overridden by means of the
.Fl f
option.
.Pp
When the emulation is turned on, a middle-button event can be generated
by simultaneously pressing the left and right buttons.
When turned off, a middle-button event is generated by pushing the fire-button
of joystick1.
Note that you'll need a special type of mouse to use this.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Nx 1.3
