.Sh NAME
.Nm cd
.Nd change working directory
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm cd
.Op Ar directory
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Since
.Nm
affects the current shell execution environment, it is always provided
as a shell regular built-in.
For more information consult the manual page for the shell in use.
.Pp
The
.Ar directory
operand is an absolute or relative pathname which becomes the new
working directory.
The interpretation of a relative pathname by
.Nm
depends on the
.Ev CDPATH
environment variable (see below).
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affect the execution of
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width Ev
.It Ev CDPATH
A colon-separated list of pathnames that refer to directories.
If the
.Ar directory
operand does not begin with a slash
.Pq Ql \&/
character, and the first
component is not dot
.Pq Ql \&.
or dot-dot
.Pq Ql \&.. ,
.Nm
searches for the
.Ar directory
relative to each directory named in the
.Ev CDPATH
variable, in the order listed.
The new working directory is set to the first matching directory found.
An empty string in place of a directory pathname represents the current
directory.
If the new working directory was derived from
.Ev CDPATH ,
it will be printed to the standard output.
.It Ev HOME
If
.Nm cd
is invoked without arguments and the
.Ev HOME
environment variable exists and contains a directory name, that directory
becomes the new working directory.
.It Ev OLDPWD
Set to the previous working directory after a directory change.
Not supported by
.Xr csh 1 .
.It Ev PWD
Set to the current working directory.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std cd
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr csh 1 ,
.Xr ksh 1 ,
.Xr pwd 1 ,
.Xr sh 1 ,
.Xr chdir 2
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm cd
command is expected to be
.St -p1003.2
compatible.
