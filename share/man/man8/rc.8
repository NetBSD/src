.Dt RC 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rc ,
.Nm rc.shutdown ,
.Nm rc.d/
.Nd startup and shutdown scripts
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rc
.Nm rc.shutdown
.Nm rc.d/
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the command script which controls the startup of various services,
and is invoked by
.Xr init 8
as part of the process of entering the automatic reboot to multi-user startup,
or after the single user mode shell has exited.
If
.Xr init 8
is starting the automatic reboot process,
.Nm
is invoked with the argument of
.Sq autoboot .
.Pp
.Nm rc.shutdown
is the command script which shuts down various services, and is invoked by
.Xr shutdown 8
as part of the process of shutting down the system.
.Pp
.Nm rc.d/
is the directory which contains various scripts, one for each service,
which are called by
.Nm
at startup,
.Nm rc.shutdown
at shutdown,
and as necessary during system operation to stop, start, restart, reload,
(etc) the service.
.Ss Operation of rc
.Bl -enum
.It
Source
.Pa /etc/rc.subr
to load various shell functions to use.
.It
If autobooting, set
.Dv $autoboot
to
.Sq yes ,
and enable a flag which prevents the
.Nm rc.d
scripts from performing the check for already running processes
(thus speeding up the boot process).
This speedup won't occur when
.Nm
is started up after exiting the single-user shell.
.It
Invoke
.Xr rcorder 8
to order the files in
.Pa /etc/rc.d/
and assigns the result to a variable.
.It
Calls each script in turn using run_rc_script() (from
.Pa /etc/rc.subr ) ,
which sets
.Dv $1
to
.Sq start ,
and sources the script in a subshell.
If the script has a
.Sq .sh
suffix then it is sourced directly into the current shell.
.El
.Ss Operation of rc.shutdown
.Bl -enum
.It
Source
.Pa /etc/rc.subr
to load various shell functions to use.
.It
Invoke
.Xr rcorder 8
to order the files in
.Pa /etc/rc.d/
that have a
.Dq shutdown
keyword,
reverses that order, and assigns the result to a variable.
.It
Calls each script in turn using run_rc_script() (from
.Pa /etc/rc.subr ) ,
which sets
.Dv $1
to
.Sq stop ,
and sources the script in a subshell.
If the script has a
.Sq .sh
suffix then it is sourced directly into the current shell.
.El
.Ss Contents of rc.d/
.Pp
.Nm rc.d/
is located in
.Pa /etc/rc.d .
The following file naming conventions are currently used in
.Nm rc.d/ :
.Bl -tag -width ALLUPPERCASE -offset indent
.It ALLUPPERCASE
Scripts that are
.Sq placeholders
to ensure that certain operations are done before others, such as:
.Bl -tag -width SERVERS
.It DAEMON
before all daemons
.It LOGIN
before user login processes
.It SERVERS
ensure basic services exist for services that start early.
.El
.It foo.sh
Scripts that are to be sourced into the current shell rather than a subshell.
Extreme care must be taken in using this, as the startup sequence will
terminate if the script does.
.Pa rc.d/fsck.sh
uses this behaviour to terminate the boot in case of a failed disk check.
.It foo
Scripts that are sourced in a subshell.
.El
.Pp
The scripts are expected to support at least the following arguments:
.Bl -tag -width restart -offset indent
.It start
Start the program.
This should check that the program is to be started as specified by
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
If
.Sq forcestart
is given, ignore the rc.conf check and start anyway.
.It stop
If the program is to be started as specified by
.Xr rc.conf 5 ,
stop the program.
This should check that the program is running and complain if it's not.
If
.Sq forcestop
is given, ignore the rc.conf check and attempt to stop.
.It restart
Effectively perform a stop then a start.
.It status
Show the status of the program.
Defaults to displaying the process ID of the process (if running).
.El
.Pp
Other arguments (such as
.Sq reload ,
.Sq dumpdb ,
etc) can be added if necessary.
.Pp
In order to simplify scripts, the run_rc_command() function from
.Pa /etc/rc.subr
may be used.
.Sh FILES
