.Dt INSTALLBOOT 8
.Os 
.Sh NAME
.Nm installboot
.Nd install a bootstrap on an FFS filesystem partition
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm installboot
.Op Fl Ntuv
.Ar device
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm installboot
prepares the
.Pq physically
first partition on a device for boot-strapping from the TOS-ROM. The
bootstrap is written into the bootblock area on the partition, right
in front of the disk pack label, and hence limited in size to
LABELOFFSET bytes. A disk pack label should be created
.Po
see
.Xr disklabel 8
.Pc
before installing the bootstrap.
.Pp
The bootstrap is split into two parts: a small first-stage program
that resides in the
.Pq physically
first 512 bytes on the device
.Pq as specified by Atari Corp. ,
and a second-stage program that immediately follows the first-stage
program. The first-stage program is loaded into memory by the ROM.
After receiving control, it loads the second-stage program and the
disk label. The second-stage boot program uses the stand-alone
filesystem code in
.Dq libsa.a
to load the kernel from the root-filesystem on the device. The
prototype code for the first-stage boot program can be found in
.Pa /usr/mdec/fdboot
.Pq floppy disk code ,
.Pa /usr/mdec/sdboot
.Pq SCSI disk code
and
.Pa /usr/mdec/wdboot
.Pq IDE disk code .
The second-stage boot program is stored in
.Pa /usr/mdec/bootxx .
.Pp
For backwards compatibility with the vendor specific AHDI disk
label, a\ special first-stage boot program is provided in
.Pa /usr/mdec/xxboot.ahdi .
Together with the general second-stage boot program, it is installed
in the AHDI partition where the
.Nx
disk label lives. Furthermore,
the AHDI specifications require an additional bootstrap, which is
written into the AHDI root sector
.Pq disk block zero .
The prototype code for this AHDI compliant bootstrap can be found in
.Pa /usr/mdec/sdb00t.ahdi
and
.Pa /usr/mdec/wdb00t.ahdi .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl N
Do not actually write anything on the disk.
.It Fl t
Number of tracks per cylinder (IDE disk).
.It Fl u
Number of sectors per track (IDE disk).
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
.El
.Pp
The arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width device
.It Ar device
The name of the device on which the bootstrap is to be installed.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following command will install the first-stage and second-stage
boot programs in the bootblock area on
.Dq sd0c :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
installboot sd0
.Ed
.Sh CAVEATS
.Nm
knows too much about kernel internal details, forcing it to
check the running kernel's release and revision.
.Pp
Because neither the floppy disk driver nor
.Xr disklabel 8
are capable of creating a disk pack label on a floppy disk,
.Nm
has to create a\ fictitious label, that is not used by the kernel.
.Pp
Except for installation of the bootcode on floppy,
.Nm
automatically sets the boot preference in NVRAM to
.Nx .

command first appeared in
