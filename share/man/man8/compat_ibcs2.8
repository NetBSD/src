.Sh NAME
.Nm compat_ibcs2
.Nd setup procedure for running iBCS2 binaries
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nx
supports running Intel Binary Compatibility Standard 2 (iBCS2) binaries.
This only applies to i386 systems for now.
Binaries are supported from SCO
.Ux
and other systems derived from
.At V.3 .
iBCS2 support is only well tested using SCO binaries.
XENIX binaries are also supported although not as well tested.
SVR4 binaries are supported by the
.Dv COMPAT_SVR4
option.
.Pp
iBCS2 supports COFF, ELF, and x.out (XENIX) binary formats.
Binaries from SCO OpenServer (version 5.x) are the only ELF binaries
that have been tested.
Most programs should work, but not ones that use or depend on:
.Pp
.Bl -item -compact -offset indent
.It
kernel internal data structures
.It
STREAMS drivers (other than TCP/IP sockets)
.It
local X displays (uses a STREAMS pipe)
.It
virtual 8086 mode
.El
.Pp
The iBCS2 compatibility feature is active for kernels compiled with
the
.Dv COMPAT_IBCS2
option enabled.
If support for iBCS2 ELF executables is desired, the
.Dv EXEC_ELF32
option should be enabled in addition to
.Dv COMPAT_IBCS2 .
.Pp
Many COFF-format programs and most ELF-format programs are dynamically
linked.
This means that you will also need the shared libraries that
the program depends on.
Also, you will need to create a
.Dq shadow root
directory for iBCS2 binaries on your
.Nx
system.
This directory is named
.Pa /emul/ibcs2 .
Any file operations done by iBCS2 programs run under
.Nx
will look in this directory first.
So, if an iBCS2
program opens, for example,
.Pa /etc/passwd ,
.Nx
will first try to open
.Pa /emul/ibcs2/etc/passwd ,
and if that does not exist open the
.Sq real
.Pa /etc/passwd
file.
It is recommended that you install iBCS2 packages
that include configuration files, etc. under
.Pa /emul/ibcs2 ,
to avoid naming conflicts with possible
.Nx
counterparts.
Shared libraries should also be installed in the shadow tree.
.Pp
Generally, you will need to look for the shared libraries that
iBCS2 binaries depend on only the first few times that you install
an iBCS2 program on your
.Nx
system.
After a while, you will have a sufficient set of iBCS2 shared
libraries on your system to be able to run newly imported iBCS2
binaries without any extra work.
.Ss Setting up shared libraries
How to get to know which shared libraries iBCS2 binaries need, and
where to get them? Depending on the file type of the executable, there
are different possibilities (when following these instructions: you
will need to be root on your
.Nx
system to do the necessary
installation steps).
.Bl -tag -width "COFF binaries"
.It COFF binaries
You can simply copy all of the available shared libraries since they
are fairly small in size.
The COFF shared libraries are typically
found in /shlib and can be obtained from the following sources:
.Bd -literal
SCO UNIX version 3.x (aka ODT)
SCO UNIX version 5.x (aka OpenServer)
SCO UnixWare
Many versions of SVR4.2/x86
.Ed
.Pp
After copying the shared libraries, you should have at least the
following files on your system:
.Bd -literal
.Pa /emul/ibcs2/shlib/libc_s
.Pa /emul/ibcs2/shlib/libnsl_s
.Pa /emul/ibcs2/shlib/protlib_s
.Ed
.It ELF binaries
You can simply copy all of the available shared libraries from the
source system or distribution or use
.Xr ldd 1
to determine the libraries required by a specific binary.
.Pp
After copying the shared libraries, you should have at least the
following files on your system:
.Bd -literal
.Pa /emul/ibcs2/usr/lib/libc.so.1
.Pa /emul/ibcs2/usr/lib/libcrypt.so
.Pa /emul/ibcs2/usr/lib/libndbm.so
.Pa /emul/ibcs2/usr/lib/libsocket.so.1
.Ed
.Pp
.El
If you don't have access to a SCO system, you will need to get the
extra files you need from a SCO distribution.
As of January 1998, SCO
sells a copy of SCO OpenServer (iBCS2) and/or SCO UnixWare (SVR4) for
personal/non-commercial use for only the cost of shipping (about $20US).
The distribution comes on an ISO9660-format CDROM which can be
mounted and used to copy the necessary files.
.Pp
Run the following script to copy the basic set of files from a SCO
distribution directory mounted somewhere locally:
.Bd -literal
/usr/share/examples/emul/ibcs2/ibcs2-setup [directory]
.Ed
.Pp
You should now be set up for SCO binaries which only need standard
shared libs.
.Sh BUGS
The information about SCO distributions may become outdated.
.Pp
Attempting to a use a nameserver on the local host does not currently
work due to an absurd shortcut taken by the iBCS2 network code
(remember that there are no kernel sockets).
.Pp
16/32/64 bit offsets may not be handled correctly in all cases.
