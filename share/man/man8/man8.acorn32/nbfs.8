.Sh NAME
.Nm nbfs
.Nd NetBSD boot filing system for RISC OS
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm *NBFS
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a filing system, implemented as a RISC OS relocatable module, to allow
read-only access to
.Nx
file systems from RISC OS.
It supports reading FFSv1, FFSv2, LFSv1, and LVSv2 partitions from disks
supported by FileCore-based filing systems such as ADFS.
.Pp
Pathnames on
.Nm
follow RISC OS conventions, as described in the various RISC OS
.%T User Guides .
The underlying FileCore instance used by
.Nm
is selected by the filing system's special field, while the disk and
.Nx
partition are selected by the disk name.
Thus, to refer to the first
.Nx
partition of the first ADFS hard disk, one
would use
.Pa NBFS#ADFS::4a .
RISC OS file names are generated from
.Nx
file names by replacing
.Ql .
with
.Ql / .
Files whose names contain characters not allowed in RISC OS file names
are not accessible through
.Nm .
Thus, as a full example, the file
.Pa /etc/resolv.conf
on the partition mentioned above would be referred to as
.Pa NBFS#ADFS::4a.$.etc.resolv/conf .
.Sh LIMITATIONS
.Nm
is very limited.
