.Sh NAME
.Nm compat_svr4
.Nd setup procedure for running SVR4/iBCS2 binaries
.Sh DESCRIPTION
NetBSD supports running SVR4/iBCS2 binaries. This code has been tested on
i386 and sparc systems. Most programs should work, but not ones that use
or depend on:
.sp
.Bl -tag -width 123 -compact -offset indent
.It kernel internal data structures
.br
.It the /proc filesystem
.br
.It the pty subsystem
.br
.It the ticotsord loopback rpc mechanism (nis uses this)
.br
.It sound and video interfaces
.br
.It threads (ttsession uses threads)
.br
.It the streams administrative driver
.El
.sp
The SVR4 compatibility feature is active
for kernels compiled with the
.Dv COMPAT_SVR4
option enabled.
Since support for ELF executables is included
only if the kernel is compiled with the
.Dv EXEC_ELF32
or
.Dv EXEC_ELF64
options enabled, kernels which include
.Dv COMPAT_SVR4
should also typically include
.Dv EXEC_ELF32
(for 32-bit ELF support)
and/or
.Dv EXEC_ELF64
(for 64-bit ELF support).
.Pp
Most SVR4 programs are dynamically linked. This means that you will
also need the shared libraries that the program depends on and the
runtime linker. Also, you will need to create a "shadow root"
directory for SVR4 binaries on your NetBSD system. This directory
is named /emul/svr4. Any file operations done by SVR4 programs
run under NetBSD will look in this directory first. So, if a SVR4
program opens, for example, /etc/passwd, NetBSD will
first try to open /emul/svr4/etc/passwd, and if that does not exist
open the 'real' /etc/passwd file. It is recommended that you install
SVR4 packages that include configuration files, etc under /emul/svr4,
to avoid naming conflicts with possible NetBSD counterparts. Shared
libraries should also be installed in the shadow tree.
.Pp
The simplest way to setup your system for SVR4 binaries is:

.Bl -tag -width 123 -compact
.It 1.
Make the necessary directories:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 123 -compact -offset indent
.It (me@netbsd) mkdir -p /emul/svr4/{dev,etc}
.br
.It (me@netbsd) mkdir -p /emul/svr4/usr/{bin,lib}
.br
.It (me@netbsd) mkdir -p /emul/svr4/usr/openwin/{bin,lib}
.El
.Pp
.It 2.
Copy files from an svr4 system:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 123 -compact -offset indent
.It (me@svr4) cd /usr/lib
.br
.It (me@svr4) tar -cf -\ . | \e
.in +5
.It rsh netbsd 'cd /emul/svr4/usr/lib; tar -xpf -'
.in -5
.El
.Pp
If you are running openwindows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 123 -compact -offset indent
.It (me@svr4) cd /usr/openwin/lib
.br
.It (me@svr4) tar -cf -\ . | \e
.in +5
.It rsh netbsd 'cd /emul/svr4/usr/openwin/lib; tar -xpf -'
.in -5
.El
.Pp
.It 3.
Setup the configuration files and devices:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 123 -compact -offset indent
.It (me@netbsd) cd /usr/share/samples/emul/svr4/etc
.br
.It (me@netbsd) cp netconfig nsswitch.conf /emul/svr4/etc
.br
.It (me@netbsd) cp SVR4_MAKEDEV /emul/svr4/dev
.br
.It (me@netbsd) cd /emul/svr4/dev; ./SVR4_MAKEDEV all
.El
.El
.Pp
An alternative method is to mount a whole SVR4 partition in /emul/svr4
and then override with other mounts /emul/svr4/etc and /emul/svr4/dev.
.Sh BUGS
Many system calls are still not emulated. The streams emulation is
incomplete (socketpair does not work yet).
