.Dt BOOT 8 macppc
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm boot
.Nd Macppc system bootstrapping procedures
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss Power fail and crash recovery
Normally, the system will reboot itself at power-up or after crashes.
An automatic consistency check of the file systems will be performed
as described in
.Xr fsck 8 ,
and unless this fails, the system will resume multi-user operations.
.Ss Cold starts
The boot ROM performs a Power On Self Test (POST) then loads Open
Firmware.
Depending on the Open Firmware variable
.Sq Ev auto-boot?
it will either stop at the Open Firmware
prompt or attempt to boot an operating system.
Depending on the contents
of the
.Sq Ev use-nvramrc? ,
.Sq Ev boot-command ,
.Sq Ev boot-device ,
and
.Sq Ev boot-file
Open Firmware variables, it will attempt to boot
.Tn MacOS ,
.Tn "MacOS X" ,
or
.Nx .
.Pp
To boot
.Nx ,
Open Firmware loads the bootloader
.Xr macppc/ofwboot 8
from the specified
.Sq Ev boot-device .
The bootloader then loads the kernel from the
.Sq Ev boot-file ,
.Pq if it exists .
Otherwise, it tries to load (in the following order):
.Pa netbsd , netbsd.gz ,
or
.Pa netbsd.macppc
on the
.Dq a
partition of the same device that had the bootloader.
.Ss "Open Firmware Commands"
An essential but incomplete list of Open Firmware commands follows.
A more thorough list is contained in the FAQ.

.Ss "After bootstrap"
Once the
.Nx Ns Tn /macppc
kernel is booted normally
it initializes itself and proceeds to start the system.
An automatic consistency check of the file systems takes place,
and unless this fails, the system comes up to multi-user operation.
.Pp
The proper way to shut the system down is with the
.Xr shutdown 8
command.
.Pp
If the system crashes, it will enter the kernel debugger,
.Xr ddb 4 ,
if it is configured in the kernel.
If the crash occurred during initialization and the debugger is
not present or is exited, the kernel will halt the system.
.Pp
If the crash occurred during normal operation and the debugger
is not present or is exited, the system will attempt a dump to the
configured dump device (which will be automatically recovered with
.Xr savecore 8
during the next bootstrap cycle), and after the dump is complete (successful
or not) the kernel will attempt a reboot.

.Sh BUGS
The device names used by
.Nx Ns Tn /macppc
and Open Firmware often have no relation to each other.
.Pp
Apple Computer's Open Firmware implementation is easily confused.
It is best to reboot your computer
after a failed boot attempt,
.Ic halt ,
or
.Ic "shutdown -h" .
Use the Open Firmware
.Ic reset-all
command.
.Pp
Apple Computer's Open Firmware implementation is notoriously bad.
Thorough instructions for installing and booting
.Nx
are in the install notes
.Pq Pa INSTALL.html
included with every release of
.Nx .
