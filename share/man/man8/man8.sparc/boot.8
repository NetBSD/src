.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss Power fail and crash recovery
Normally, the system will reboot itself at power-up or after crashes.
An automatic consistency check of the file systems will be performed
as described in
.Xr fsck 8 ,
and unless this fails, the system will resume multi-user operations.
.Ss Cold starts
The
.Nx
boot
.Pa netbsd
from partition a of the boot device,
which must currently be an
.Dq sd
disk.
.Ss Boot program options
.Bl -tag -width xxx
.It Fl a
Prompt for the root file system device, the system crash dump
device, and the path to
.Xr init 8 .
.It Fl d
Bring the system up in debug mode.
Here it waits for a kernel debugger connect; see
.Xr gdb 1 .
.It Fl q
Boot the system in quiet mode.
.It Fl s
Bring the system up in single-user mode.
.It Fl v
Boot the system in verbose mode.
.El
.Pp
Any extra flags or arguments, or the
.Aq Ar boot string
after the -- separator are passed to the boot PROM.
Other flags are currently ignored.
.Pp
The SPARC boot ROM comes in two flavours: an
.Dq old-style
ROM is used in sun4 machines, while a
.Dq new-style
ROM can be found on sun4c and sun4m models.
The
.Dq new-style
SPARC boot ROM is a full-featured Forth system with emacs key bindings.
It can be put in
.Dq old-style
user-interface compatibility mode (in which case it shows a simple
.Sq \*[Gt]
prompt), but this is essentially useless.
However, by default the ROM runs in old-mode; to enter new-mode type
.Sq n .
The ROM then shows a Forth-style
.Dq ok
prompt.
It is recommended to have the ROM always start in its native
.Dq new-style
mode.
Utter the following incantation in new-mode to force the ROM to always start
in new-mode.
.Pp
.Pa \	ok
setenv sunmon-compat? false
.Pp
The ROM will normally load the kernel from
.Dq sd(0,0,0)vmunix .
To change the default so that
.Nx
will be loaded from somewhere else, type the following
.Pp
.Pa \	ok
setenv boot-from sd(0,0,0)netbsd
.Pp
At any time you can break back to the ROM by pressing the
.Sq L1
and
.Sq a
keys at the same time (if the console is a serial port the same is
achieved by sending a
.Sq break ) .
If you do this accidentally you can continue whatever was in progress
by typing
.Sq go .
