.Sh NAME
.Nm boot
.Nd system bootstrapping procedures
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm boot
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss Power fail and crash recovery
Normally, the system will reboot itself at power-up or after crashes.
An automatic consistency check of the file systems will be performed
as described in
.Xr fsck 8 ,
and unless this fails, the system will resume multi-user operations.
.Ss Cold starts
The prep architecture does not allow the direct booting of a kernel
from the hard drive.
Instead it requires a complete boot image to be loaded.
This boot image contains a
.Nx
kernel, which will then provide access to the devices on the machine.
The image can be placed on any device that the firmware considers
a bootable device.
Usually this is either a SCSI disk, tape, CD-ROM, or floppy drive.
.Ss Boot program options
The prep architecture and bootloader does not support any option
parsing at the boot prompt.
.Ss Boot partition
The prep port requires a special boot partition on the primary boot
device in order to load the kernel.
This partition consists of a PC-style i386 partition label, a small
bootloader, and a kernel image.
The prep firmware looks for a partition of type 0x41 (65) and
expects the bootloader, immediately followed by the kernel, to be
there.
The
.Xr prep/mkbootimage 8
command needs to be used to generate this image.
