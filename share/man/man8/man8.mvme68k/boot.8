.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss Power fail and crash recovery
Normally, the system will reboot itself at power-up or after crashes.
An automatic consistency check of the file systems will be performed
as described in
.Xr fsck 8 .
and unless this fails, the system will resume multi-user operations.
.Ss Cold starts from disk
The disk-boot program
.Pa ( /usr/mdec/bootsd )
will attempt to load
.Pa netbsd
from partition A of the boot device,
which must currently be an
.Dq sd
disk.
.Ss Cold starts from tape
The tape-boot program
.Pa ( /usr/mdec/bootst )
will attempt to load
.Pa netbsd
from a SCSI tape drive.
.Ss Cold starts over a network
The network boot program
.Pa ( /usr/mdec/netboot )
will load
.Pa netbsd
from the NFS root as determined by the procedure described in
.Xr diskless 8 .
Note that the MVME147 is unable to boot directly from the
network without the help of a small bootloader program
.Pa ( /usr/mdec/sboot ) .
.Ss Boot program options
.Bl -tag -width xxx
.It Fl a
Prompt for the root file system device, the system crash dump
device, and the path to
.Xr init 8 .
.It Fl d
Bring the system up in debug mode.
Here it waits for a kernel debugger connect; see
.Xr ddb 4 .
.It Fl q
Boot the system in quiet mode.
.It Fl s
Bring the system up in single-user mode.
.It Fl v
Boot the system in verbose mode.
.El
.Pp
Any extra flags or arguments, or the
.Ar <boot string>
after the -- separator are passed to the boot PROM.
Other flags are currently ignored.
.Pp
At any time you can break to the kernel debugger
.Xr ddb 4
(assuming
.Sy options DDB
was specified in the kernel configuration file)
by sending a serial line BREAK character.
If you do this accidentally you can continue whatever was in progress
by typing
.Sq c
followed by the return key.
