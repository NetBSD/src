.Sh NAME
.Nm MAKEDEV
.Nd create system and device special files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar special Op Ar ...
.Pp
.Nm
.Ar device Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to create system and device special files.
As arguments it takes the names of known devices, like
.Ar sd0 ,
or of special targets, like
.Pa all
or
.Pa std ,
which create a collection of device special files.
.Pp
The script is in
.Pa /dev/MAKEDEV
and must be called from the
.Pa /dev
directory.
For the creation of the devices,
.Xr mknod 8
is used, which can only be used for creating devices by the
super-user.
.Pp
The special targets supported on
.Nx Ns / Ns arm26
are:
.Pp
.\" @@@SPECIAL@@@
.Bl -tag -width 01234567 -compact
.It Ar all
Makes all known devices, including local devices. If units are expected for a device
.Pa MAKEDEV
supplies the standard numbers.
.It Ar minimal
A minimal set of devices for install disks, etc.
.It Ar std
The standard devices (console, drum, klog, kmem, mem, null, stderr, stdin, stdout, tty, zero).
.It Ar local
Configuration specific devices which are created by running the
.Pa MAKEDEV.local
shell script with the argument ``all''.

in which the device files are not always sorted, which may result
in an unusual (non-alphabetical) order.
