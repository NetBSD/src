.Dt MKBOOTIMAGE 8 alpha
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mkbootimage
.Nd turn Alpha bootstrap programs into bootable images
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm /usr/mdec/mkbootimage
.Op Fl nv
.Ar infile
.Op Ar outfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility creates bootable image files from
.Nx Ns Tn /alpha
bootstrap programs.
Bootable image files can be placed directly on disk or tape to
create bootable media which can be booted by the SRM console.
This is primarily useful for creating bootable tapes or disk sets
with the
.Pa /usr/mdec/ustarboot
bootstrap program, or for creating firmware upgrade media
using firmware upgrade programs.
.Pp
The bootstrap program
.Ar infile
is padded to a 512-byte boundary, has a properly formed
Alpha Boot Block prepended, and is written to the output file
.Ar outfile .
If no output file is specified, the result is written to
standard output.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility does not install bootstrap programs to make
disks bootable.
To do that, use
.Xr installboot 8 .
Similarly, it is not necessary to use
.Nm
to create images to boot over the network; network-capable
bootstrap programs are usable without modification.
.Pp
The options recognized by
.Nm
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl n
Do not actually write the result to the output file or
standard output.
.It Fl v
Print information about what
.Nm
is doing.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/mdec/ustarboot -compact
.It Pa /usr/mdec/ustarboot
.Dq ustar
file system bootstrap program
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std mkbootimage
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mkbootimage as200_v5_8.exe as200_v5_8.exe.bootimage
.Ed
.Pp
Create a bootable image from the (firmware image) file
.Pa as200_v5_8.exe .
That bootable image could then be written to floppy,
disk, CD-ROM, or tape to create bootable firmware
update media.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
(mkbootimage /usr/mdec/ustarboot; tar cvf - netbsd) | \\
    dd of=/dev/rst0
.Ed
.Pp
Make a bootable image from the bootstrap program
.Pa /usr/mdec/ustarboot ,
concatenate it with a tar file containing a kernel,
and write the output to a tape.
This is an example of how to create a tape which boots a kernel.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr alpha/boot 8 ,
.Xr installboot 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nx Ns Tn /alpha
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Nx 1.4 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
utility was written by
.An Chris Demetriou .
