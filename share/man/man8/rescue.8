.Dt RESCUE 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rescue
.Nd rescue utilities in
.Pa /rescue
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Pa /rescue
directory contains a collection of common utilities intended for use
in recovering a badly damaged system.
With the transition to a dynamically-linked root beginning with
.Nx 2.0 ,
there is a real possibility that the standard tools in
.Pa /bin
and
.Pa /sbin
may become non-functional due to a failed upgrade or a disk error.
The tools in
.Pa /rescue
are statically linked and should therefore be more resistant to
damage.
However, being statically linked, the tools in
.Pa /rescue
are also less functional than the standard utilities.
In particular, they do not have full use of the locale,
.Xr pam 3 ,
and nsswitch libraries.
.Pp
If your system fails to boot, and it shows an error message similar to:
.Pp
.Dl "init: not found"
.Pp
try booting the system with the boot flag
.Dq Fl a
and supplying
.Pa /rescue/init ,
which is the
.Nm
.Xr init 8 ,
as the init path.
.Pp
If your system fails to boot, and it shows a prompt similar to:
.Pp
.Dl "Enter full pathname of shell or RETURN for /bin/sh: "
.Pp
the first thing to try running is the standard shell,
.Pa /bin/sh .
If that fails, try running
.Pa /rescue/sh ,
which is the
.Nm
shell.
To repair the system, the root partition must first be remounted
read-write.
This can be done with the following
.Xr mount 8
command:
.Pp
.Dl "/rescue/mount -uw /"
.Pp
The next step is to double-check the contents of
.Pa /bin ,
.Pa /lib ,
.Pa /libexec ,
and
.Pa /sbin ,
possibly mounting a
.Nx
installation CD-ROM
and copying files from there.
Once it is possible to successfully run
.Pa /bin/sh , /bin/ls ,
and other standard utilities, try rebooting back into the standard
system.
.Pp
The
.Pa /rescue
tools are compiled using
.Xr crunchgen 1 ,
which makes them considerably more compact than the standard
utilities.
