.Sh NAME
.Nm drtest
.Nd stand-alone disk test program
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a stand-alone program used to read a disk
track by track.
It was primarily intended as a test program
for new stand-alone drivers, but has shown
useful in other contexts as well, such as
verifying disks and running speed
tests. For example, when a disk has been formatted
(by
.Xr vax/format 8 ) ,
you can check that
hard errors has been taken care of by running
.Nm .
No hard errors should be found, but in many cases
quite a few soft
.Tn ECC
errors will be reported.
.Pp
While
.Nm
is running, the cylinder number is printed on
the console for every 10th cylinder read.
.Sh EXAMPLES
A sample run of
.Nm
is shown below.
In this example (using a 750),
.Nm
is loaded from the root file system;
usually it
will be loaded from the machine's
console storage device.  Boldface means user input.
As usual, ``#'' and ``@'' may be used to edit input.

.Li Device data: #cylinders=1024, #tracks=16, #sectors=32
.Li Testing hp(0,0), chunk size is 16384 bytes.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The diagnostics are intended to be self explanatory. Note, however, that
the device number
in the diagnostic messages is identified as
.Em typeX
instead of
.Em type(a,u)
where
.Ar X
\&= a*8+u, e.g., hp(1,3) becomes hp11.
