system bootstrapping procedures
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss Power fail and crash recovery
Normally, the system will reboot itself at power-up or after crashes.
An automatic consistency check of the file systems will be performed,
and unless this fails, the system will resume multi-user operations.
.Ss Cold starts
On a NeXT, the boot procedure uses the boot ROM to load a boot program
over the network using BOOTP and TFTP.
The
.Pa /usr/mdec
directory contains a network boot program which should be made available
via
.Xr tftp 1 .
The network boot program will load
.Pa netbsd
from the NFS root as determined by the procedure described in
.Xr diskless 8 .
