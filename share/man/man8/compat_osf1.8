.Sh NAME
.Nm compat_osf1
.Nd setup procedure for running OSF/1 binaries
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nx
supports running OSF/1 (a.k.a Digital Unix, a.k.a. Tru64) binaries on alpha
systems.
Most programs should work, including the ones that use the shared object
libraries. Programs that make direct MACH system calls will not work.
The OSF/1 compatibility feature is active for kernels compiled with the
.Dv COMPAT_OSF1
option enabled. (See
.Xr options 4 .)
.Pp
To run dynamically linked programs, you will need the OSF/1 shared libraries,
runtime linker, and certain configuration files found in /etc.
These are installed in a "shadow root" directory called /emul/osf1.
Any file operations done by OSF/1 programs run under
.Nx
will look in this directory first, and fall back to the file system proper.
So, if an OSF/1 program opens /etc/svc.conf,
.Nx
will first try to open /emul/osf1/etc/svc.conf, and if that file does
not exist it will then try /etc/svc.conf.
Shared libraries and configuration specific to OSF/1 should be installed
in the shadow tree.
.Ss Setting up /emul/osf1
There are many methods of populating /emul/osf1 with the appropriate
files, but the two easiest are:
.Pp
If you have access to an OSF/1 machine, you can copy the contents of:
.Bl -tag -width 123 -compact -offset indent
.It /shlib
.It /usr/shlib
.It /etc/sia
.It /usr/lib/X11/locale
.El
.Pp
(The latter is required to run Netscape Navigator or Communicator.)
.Pp
And the files
.Bl -tag -width 123 -compact -offset indent
.It /etc/svc.conf
.It /usr/ccs/lib/cmplrs/otabase/libots.so
.It /sbin/loader
.El
.Pp
Or, simply NFS mount the appropriate directories under /emul/osf1.
.Sh BUGS
Certain values in /emul/osf1/etc/svc.conf can cause programs to fail
with ``Bad system call''.
.Pp
Pathnames pointed to by symbolic links are not looked up in the
shadow root when running a OSF/1 executable. This is not consistent.
