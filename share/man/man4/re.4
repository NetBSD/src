.Sh DESCRIPTION
The

driver provides support for various NICs based on the RealTek RTL8139C+,
RTL8169, RTL8169S, RTL8168, and RTL8110S PCI/Cardbus Ethernet controllers,
including the following:

.El
.Pp
NICs based on the 8139C+ are capable of 10 and 100Mbps speeds over
CAT5 cable.
NICs based on the 8169, 8169S, 8168, and 8110S are capable of 10, 100, and
1000Mbps operation.
.Pp
All NICs supported by the
.Nm
driver have IP/TCP/UDP checksum offload and hardware VLAN tagging/insertion
features, and use a descriptor-based DMA mechanism.
They are also capable of TCP large send (TCP segmentation offload).
.Pp
The 8139C+ is a single-chip solution combining both a 10/100 MAC and PHY,
and its PHY is supported by
.Xr rlphy 4 .
The 8169 is a 10/100/1000 MAC only, requiring a GMII or TBI external PHY
and some 8169 based boards have Marvell 88E1000 PHY supported by
.Xr makphy 4 .
The 8169S and 8110S are single-chip devices containing both a 10/100/1000
MAC and 10/100/1000 copper PHY, which is supported by
.Xr rgephy 4 .
Standalone 10/100/1000 cards are available in both 32-bit PCI and
64-bit PCI models.
The 8110S is designed for embedded LAN-on-motherboard applications.
.Pp
The 8169, 8169S, and 8110S also support jumbo frames, which can be
configured via the interface MTU setting.
Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the
.Xr ifconfig 8
utility configures the adapter to receive and transmit jumbo frames.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width 10baseTXUTP
.It Cm autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
.It Cm 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Ic mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Ic mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 1000baseTX
Set 1000baseTX operation over twisted pair.
The RealTek GigE chips support 1000Mbps in
.Cm full-duplex
mode only.
.\" .It Cm 1000baseSX
.\" Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation.
.\" Both
.\" .Cm full-duplex
.\" and
.\" .Cm half-duplex
.\" modes are supported.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It Cm full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It Cm half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
.El
.Pp

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 5.2
and was ported to
.Nx 2.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Bill Paul Aq Mt wpaul@windriver.com .
.Sh BUGS
The Xterasys XN-152 32-bit PCI NIC, which uses the RTL8169 MAC and
Marvell 88E1000 PHY, has a defect that causes DMA corruption
if the board is plugged into a 64-bit PCI slot.
The defect lies in the board design, not the chip itself: the PCI
REQ64# and ACK64# lines should be pulled high, but they are not.
The result is that the 8169 chip is tricked into performing 64-bit
DMA transfers even though a 64-bit data path between the NIC and
the bus does not actually exist.
.Pp
Unfortunately, it is not possible to correct this problem in software,
however it is possible to detect it.
When the
.Nm
driver is loaded, it will run a diagnostic routine designed to
validate DMA operation by placing the chip in digital loopback mode
and initiating a packet transmission.
If the card functions properly, the transmitted data will
be echoed back unmodified.
If the echoed data is corrupt, the driver
will print an error message on the console and abort the device attach.
The user should ensure the NIC is installed in a 32-bit PCI slot to
avoid this problem.
.Pp
The RealTek 8169, 8169S, and 8110S chips appear to only be capable of
transmitting jumbo frames up to 7.5K in size.
