.Sh NAME
.Nm iomdkbc
.Nd ARM IOMD keyboard and mouse ports
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd iomdkbc* at iomd?
.Cd pckbd* at iomdkbc?
.Cd pms* at iomdkbc?
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver interfaces machine-independent drivers for PC keyboards and
PS/2 mice to the particular implementation of the keyboard and mouse
ports provided by the
.Tn ARM IOMD20 ,
.Tn ARM7500 ,
and
.Tn ARM7500FE .
The quadrature mouse interface on the
.Tn IOMD20
is handled by the
.Xr acorn32/qms 4
driver.
.Pp
This driver replaces the
.Xr kbd 4
and
.Xr rpckbd 4
drivers, which will be withdrawn in a future
.Nx
release.
If a kernel has
.Xr kbd 4
or
.Xr rpckbd 4
configured,
.Nm
will only be used for the mouse interface (if present).
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr acorn32/qms 4 ,
.Xr kbd 4 ,
.Xr pckbd 4 ,
.Xr pms 4 ,
.Xr rpckbd 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver was introduced in
.Nx 2.0 .
