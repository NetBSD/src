.Ox 6.4
and later in
.Nx 9.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver
was written by
.An Tobias Nygren Aq Mt tnn@NetBSD.org .
.Pp
It was inspired by (and shares its name with) the
.Ox
driver written by
.An Patrick Wildt Aq Mt patrick@blueri.se
but does not share any code.
.Sh BUGS
Some modules can be reconfigured to attach via
.Xr spi 4 ,
typically by moving surface mount zero ohm resistors.
This is currently not supported.
