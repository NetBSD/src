.Nd Exar XR21V141x USB serial adapter
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "uxrcom* at uhub?"
.Cd "ucom* at uxrcom?"
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports serial adapters based on the
XR21V1410, XR21V1412 and XR21V1414 chipsets.
Devices range from single port to eight port (implemented as a
USB hub and two
.Nm
four port instances behind it).
Examples of hardware known to work with this driver are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Dv -offset indent -compact
.It Gearmo GM-U28RS232 8 Port USB to Serial DB9 RS232 Adapter

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver attaches the Exar XR21V141x multiport chipset with individual
port drivers via
.Xr ucom 4 ,
which makes it behave like a
.Xr tty 4 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr tty 4 ,
.Xr ucom 4 ,
.Xr uhub 4 ,
.Xr modem 4 ,
.Xr usb 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Ox 6.5
and in
.Nx 9.1 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver for the single port XR21V1410 was written by
.An Mark Kettenis Aq Mt kettenis@openbsd.org .
The multi-port
.Nx
driver is based on the
.Ox
driver but uses the common
.Xr umodem 4
framework.
The
.Nx
driver was written by
by
.An Simon Burge
