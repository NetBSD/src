.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports NE2000 and compatible (including NE1000) Ethernet
cards.
While the original NE2000 is designed for ISA bus, the compatible
Realtek 8019 chip is widely used on various local busses and
.Nm
driver also supports such devices on various machines.
.Sh MEDIA SELECTION
The Realtek 8019 (ISA, ISAPnP, some PCMCIA) and Realtek 8029 (PCI)
NE2000-compatible Ethernet chips include support for software media
selection.
.Pp
Some cards based on AX88x9x chips (like X-Surf 100) also support media
selection and link auto negotiation through the
.Xr mii 4
interface.
.Pp
If one of the above chips is detected by the driver, the list of supported
media will be displayed.
.Pp
For all other chips supported by the
.Nm
driver, media selection must be performed either via card jumper
settings or by vendor-supplied configuration programs.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "ne0: where did the card go?"
The driver found the card, but was unable to make the card respond
to complete the configuration sequence.
