.Sh NAME
.Nm ne
.Nd NE2000 and compatible Ethernet cards device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ne0 at isa? port 0x300 irq 9"
.Cd "ne* at isapnp?"
.Cd "ne* at mca? slot ?"
.Cd "ne* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "ne* at pcmcia? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports NE2000 and compatible (including NE1000) Ethernet
cards.
.Sh MEDIA SELECTION
The Realtek 8019 (ISA, ISAPnP, some PCMCIA) and Realtek 8029 (PCI)
NE2000-compatible Ethernet chips include support for software media
selection.  If one of these chips is detected by the driver, the list
of supported media will be displayed.
.Pp
For all other chips supported by the
.Nm
driver, media selection must be performed either via card jumper
settings or by vendor-supplied configuration programs.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "ne0: where did the card go?"
The driver found the card, but was unable to make the card respond
to complete the configuration sequence.
