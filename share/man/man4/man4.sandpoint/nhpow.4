.Sh NAME
.Nm nhpow
.Nd driver for the NH-230/231 board control GPIO pins
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "nhpow0 at mainbus0"
.Cd "gpio* at nhpow0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver initializes the LEDs and the fan speed during boot and
establishes a reboot and power-off hook in the kernel.
.Pp
.Nm
also detects a soft power-off condition, which is triggered by holding
the front panel power button pressed for several seconds.
This driver can optionally invoke
.Xr powerd 8
to get a finer control over the system shutdown procedure.
It is capable of reporting a power-button-pressed event.
Refer to the
.Xr powerd 8
manual section for more details.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides access to its 8 bidirectional GPIO pins through the
.Xr gpio 4
controller interface.
The pins have the following meaning when being written:
.Bl -column "Pin" "Active level" "Function" -offset indent
.It Sy "Pin" Ta Sy "Active level" Ta Sy "Function"
.It Li "0" Ta "high" Ta "System power off"
.It Li "1" Ta "high" Ta "Assert system reset to all devices"
.It Li "2" Ta "low"  Ta "Status LED"
.It Li "3" Ta "high" Ta "High speed fan"
.It Li "4" Ta "low"  Ta "Debug LED 1"
.It Li "5" Ta "low"  Ta "Debug LED 2"
.It Li "6" Ta "low"  Ta "USB port 1 LED"
.It Li "7" Ta "low"  Ta "USB port 2 LED"
.El

When reading, the pins have the following meaning:
.Bl -column "Pin" "Active level" "Function" -offset indent
.It Sy "Pin" Ta Sy "Active level" Ta Sy "Function"
.It Li "0" Ta "low"  Ta "Power button pressed"
.It Li "1" Ta "low"  Ta "Reset/install button pressed"
.It Li "4" Ta "high" Ta "H/W version bit 0"
.It Li "5" Ta "high" Ta "H/W version bit 1"
.It Li "6" Ta "high" Ta "H/W version bit 2"
