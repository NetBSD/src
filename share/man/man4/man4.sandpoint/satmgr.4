.Sh NAME
.Nm satmgr
.Nd driver for satellite processor, controlling power, front panel LEDs, and buttons
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "satmgr0 at eumb? unit 0"
.Cd "satmgr0 at eumb? unit 1"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides an interface to the
.Tn NAS
builtin satellite microprocessor which controls the power, front
panel LEDs, and push buttons.
Communication is performed through character sequences, whose
definition and usage depend on the
.Tn NAS
product models.
.Pp
The device file
.Pa /dev/satmgr
can be written to control the satellite processor and the LEDs.
Reading it will return single characters for button press events.
This facility was designed to implement a
.Tn NAS
control
.Tn CGI
program.
.Pp
.Nm
detects a soft power-off condition, which is triggered by holding
the front panel power button pressed for several seconds.
This driver can optionally invoke
.Xr powerd 8
to get a finer control over the system shutdown procedure.
It is capable of reporting a power-button-pressed event.
Refer to the
.Xr powerd 8
manual section for more details.
.Pp
For
.Tn "Kurobox/Linkstation"
.Tn NAS
products it also provides a way to toggle the system watchdog with the
.Xr sysctl 8
utility.
The usage is:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# sysctl -w machdep.satmgr.hwwdog_enable=1
# sysctl -w machdep.satmgr.hwwdog_enable=0
