.Sh NAME
.Nm cardbus ,
.Nm cardslot ,
.Nm cbb
.Nd CardBus driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "cbb*      at pci? dev? function ?"
.Cd "cardslot* at cbb?"
.Cd "cardbus*  at cardslot?"
.Cd "pcmcia*   at cardslot?"
.Cd "XX*       at cardbus? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nx
provides machine-independent bus support and
drivers for CardBus devices.
.Pp
The
.Cm cbb
device represents the CardBus controller.
Each controller has a number
of slots, represented by the
.Cm cardslot
devices.
A slot can have either a CardBus card or a
.Tn PCMCIA
card, which are attached with the
.Cm cardbus
or
.Cm pcmcia
devices, respectively.
.Sh SUPPORTED DEVICES
.Nx
includes the following machine-independent CardBus
drivers, sorted by function and driver name:

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver appeared in
.Nx 1.5 .
.Sh BUGS
.Ss Memory space conflicts
.Nx
maps memory on Cardbus (and therefore PCMCIA cards behind Cardbus) in
order to access the cards (including reading CIS tuples on PCMCIA
cards) and access the devices using the
.Tn RBUS
abstraction.
When the mapping does not work, PCMCIA cards are typically ignored on
insert, and Cardbus cards are recognized but nonfunctional.
On i386, the kernel has a heuristic to choose a memory address for
mapping, defaulting to 1 GB, but choosing 0.5 GB on machines with less
than 192 MB RAM and 2 GB on machines with more than 1 GB of RAM.
The intent is to use an address that is larger than available RAM, but
low enough to work; some systems seem to have trouble with
addresses requiring more than 20 address lines.
On i386, the following kernel configuration line disables the
heuristics and forces Cardbus
memory space to be mapped at 512M; this value makes Cardbus support
(including PCMCIA attachment under a cbb) work on some notebook
models, including the IBM Thinkpad 600E (2645-4AU) and the Compaq
ARMADA M700:
.Pp
.Cd options RBUS_MIN_START="0x20000000"
.Ss PCMCIA addressing choice
By default, on i386 and amd64, the kernel uses
.Dv RBUS_IO_BASE
as 0x4000 and
.Dv RBUS_IO_SIZE
as 0x2000.
On some machines, this fails, due to a requirement that these
addresses fit within 12 bits.
The following kernel options have been reported as helpful:
.Pp
.Cd options RBUS_IO_BASE="0xa00"
.Pp
.Cd options RBUS_IO_SIZE="0x00ff"
