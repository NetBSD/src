.Sh NAME
.Nm cardbus ,
.Nm cardslot ,
.Nm cbb
.Nd CardBus driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "cbb*      at pci? dev? function ?"
.Cd "cardslot* at cbb?"
.Cd "cardbus*  at cardslot?"
.Cd "pcmcia*   at cardslot?"
.Cd "XX*       at cardbus? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nx
provides machine-independent bus support and
drivers for CardBus devices.
.Pp
The
.Cm cbb
device represents the CardBus controller.
Each controller has a number
of slots, represented by the
.Cm cardslot
devices. A slot can have either a CardBus card or a
.Tn PCMCIA
card, which are attached with the
.Cm cardbus
or
.Cm pcmcia
devices, respectively.
.Sh SUPPORTED DEVICES

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver appeared in
.Nx 1.5 .
.Sh BUGS
.Ss Memory space conflicts
.Nx
maps memory on Cardbus and PCMCIA cards in order to access the cards
(including reading CIS tuples on PCMCIA cards)
and access the devices using the
.Tn RBUS
abstraction.
When the mapping does not work, PCMCIA cards are typically ignored on
insert, and Cardbus cards are recognized but nonfunctional.
On i386, the kernel has a heuristic to choose a memory address for
mapping, defaulting to 1 GB, but choosing 0.5 GB on machines with less
than 192 MB RAM and 2 GB on machines with more than 1 GB of RAM.
The intent is to use an address that is larger than available RAM, but
low enough to work; some systems seem to have trouble with
addresses requiring more than 20 address lines.
On i386, the following kernel configuration line disables the
heuristics and forces Cardbus
memory space to be mapped at 512M; this value makes Cardbus support
(including PCMCIA attachment under a cbb) work on some notebook
models, including the IBM Thinkpad 600E (2645-4AU) and the Compaq
ARMADA M700:
