.Sh NAME
.Nm cardbus ,

.Nd CardBus driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "cbb*      at pci? dev? function ?"
.Cd "cardslot* at cbb?"
.Cd "cardbus*  at cardslot?"
.Cd "pcmcia*   at cardslot?"
.Cd "XX*       at cardbus? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nx
provides machine-independent bus support and
drivers for CardBus devices.
.Pp
The
.Cm cbb
device represents the CardBus controller.
Each controller has a number
of slots, represented by the
.Cm cardslot
devices. A slot can have either a CardBus card or a
.Tn PCMCIA
card, which are attached with the
.Cm cardbus
or
.Cm pcmcia
devices, respectively.
.Sh SUPPORTED DEVICES
.Nx
includes the following machine-independent CardBus
drivers, sorted by function and driver name:

systems.
If, on an i386-family system, the
.Nm cbb
driver reports

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver appeared in
.Nx 1.5 .
.Sh BUGS
.Ss Memory space conflicts
.Nx
maps memory on Cardbus and PCMCIA cards in order to access the cards
(including reading CIS tuples on PCMCIA cards)
and access the devices using the
.Tn RBUS
abstraction.
When the mapping does not work, PCMCIA cards are typically ignored on
insert, and Cardbus cards are recognized but nonfunctional.
The location is machine-specific, and the default location does not
work on all hardware.
On i386, the following kernel configuration line, which maps Cardbus
space at 512M rather than 1GB, has been found to make Cardbus support
(including PCMCIA attachment under a cbb) work on some notebook
models, including the IBM Thinkpad 600E (2645-4AU) and the Compaq
ARMADA M700:
