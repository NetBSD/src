.Nm lm
.Nd National Semiconductor LM78, LM79 and compatible hardware monitors
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "lm0 at isa? port 0x290"
.\" .Cd "lm0 at pnpbios0 index ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the
.Tn National Semiconductor
LM series hardware monitors and register compatible chips to be used with
the
.Xr envsys 4
API.
.Pp
These devices possess 11 sensors:
.Bl -column "Sensor" "Units" "Typical" -offset indent
.It Sy "Sensor" Ta Sy "Units" Ta Sy "Typical Use"
.It Li "IN0" Ta "uV DC" Ta "Core voltage"
.It Li "IN1" Ta "uV DC" Ta "unknown"
.It Li "IN2" Ta "uV DC" Ta "+3.3V"
.It Li "IN3" Ta "uV DC" Ta "+5V"
.It Li "IN4" Ta "uV DC" Ta "+12V"
.It Li "IN5" Ta "uV DC" Ta "-12V"
.It Li "IN6" Ta "uV DC" Ta "-5V"
