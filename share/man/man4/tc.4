.Sh NAME
.Nm tc
.Nd TURBOchannel expansion bus driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ss alpha
.Cd "tc* at tcasic?"
.Ss pmax
.Cd "tc* at mainbus0"
.Ss vax
.Cd "tc0 at vsbus0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides machine-independent support for the DEC TURBOchannel
expansion bus found on all DEC 5000-series machines with MIPS, DEC
3000-series with Alpha processors and VAXstation 4000 machines with the
optional TURBOchannel adaptor.
.Pp
Your system may support additional
.Tn TURBOchannel
devices.
Drivers for
.Tn TURBOchannel
devices not listed here are machine-dependent.
Consult your system's
.Xr intro 4
for additional information.
