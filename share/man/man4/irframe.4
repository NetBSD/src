.Sh NAME
.Nm irframe
.Nd IrDA frame level driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "irframe* at oboe?"
.Cd "irframe* at udsir?"
.Cd "irframe* at uirda?"
.Cd "irframe* at ustir?"
.Cd "pseudo-device irframetty"
.Pp
.In dev/irdaio.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for IrDA frame level transmission.
It does not contain the IrDA protocol stack per se, but the stack
can be built on top of the
.Nm
driver.
.Pp
Access to frames is via the
.Xr read 2
and
.Xr write 2
system calls.  Each write constitutes one frame, and each read yields one frame.
The
.Xr poll 2
system call can be used to check for availability of frames.
There are also a number of
.Xr ioctl 2
calls to manipulate the device:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxx
.It Dv IRDA_RESET_PARAMS
Reset the parameters set by
.Dv IRDA_SET_PARAMS .
.It Dv IRDA_SET_PARAMS Fa "(struct irda_params)"
Set the speed, extra beginning of frame bytes, and maximum frame size.
.It Dv IRDA_GET_SPEEDMASK Fa (int)
Get the set of allowable speeds.
.It Dv IRDA_GET_TURNAROUNDMASK Fa (int)
Get the set of allowable turn around times.
