.Nm iteide
.Nd Integrated Technology Express IDE disk controllers driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "iteide* at pci? dev ? function ? flags 0x0000"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the IT8211 and IT8212 IDE controllers which are
found on some Gigabyte motherboards (as
.Dq GigaRAID )
and some PCI cards.
This driver provides the interface with the hardware for the
.Xr ata 4
driver.
.Pp
The optional RAID functionality of the IT8211 and IT8212 is not
supported and is explicitly disabled by the
.Nm
driver.
The controller will act like a regular IDE controller with no RAID
functionality.
