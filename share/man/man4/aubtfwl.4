.Sh NAME
.Nm aubtfwl
.Nd Atheros AR3011/AR3012 Firmware Loader
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "aubtfwl* at uhub?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver manages automatic loading of firmware on the Atheros AR3011
and AR3012 Bluetooth chipsets.
The firmware files should be obtained and placed in a
.Pa ubt/
directory in the search path of the
.Xr firmload 9
kernel subsystem.
Upon attachment, the
.Nm
driver will load the necessary firmware files and the device will detach
and reattach as a generic Bluetooth device using the
.Xr ubt 4
driver.
.Pp
For AR3011 chipsets, you will need the
.Pa ath3k-1.fw
firmware file in
.Pa ubt/ ,
and for AR3012 chipsets, the files
.Pa ar3k/AthrBT_*.dfu
and
.Pa ar3k/ramps_*.dfu
in
.Pa ubt/ar3k/ .
.Pp
The firmware files can be obtained from the Linux firmware
git repository at
.Lk http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git .
