.Sh NAME
.Nm pci
.Nd introduction to machine-independent PCI bus support and drivers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pci* at mainbus? bus ?"
.Cd "pci* at pchb? bus ?"
.Cd "pci* at ppb? bus ?"
.Pp
.Cd options PCIVERBOSE
.Cd options PCI_CONFIG_DUMP
.Cd options PCI_ADDR_FIXUP
.Cd options PCI_BUS_FIXUP
.Cd options PCI_INTR_FIXUP
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nx
includes a machine-independent PCI bus subsystem and several
machine-independent PCI device drivers.
.Pp
Your system may support additional PCI devices and attachments.
Drivers for PCI devices not listed here are machine-dependent.
Consult your system's
.Xr intro 4
for additional information.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width PCI_ADDR_FIXUP -offset 3n
.It Dv PCI_ADDR_FIXUP
Fixup PCI I/O and memory addresses.
.Pp
Some i386 and amd64 BIOS implementations don't allocate I/O space and
memory space for some PCI devices \(em primarily BIOS in PnP mode, or laptops
that expect devices to be configured via ACPI.
Since necessary space isn't allocated, those devices
will not work without special handling.
.Pp
This option allocates I/O space and memory space
instead of relying upon the BIOS to do so.
.Pp
If necessary space is already correctly assigned to the devices,
this option leaves the space as is.
.It Dv PCI_BUS_FIXUP
Fixup PCI bus numbering; needed for many
.Xr cardbus 4
bridges.
.Pp
Each PCI bus and CardBus should have a unique bus number.
But some BIOS implementations don't assign a bus number
for subordinate PCI buses.
And many BIOS implementations
don't assign a bus number for CardBuses.
.Pp
A typical symptom of this is the following boot message:
.D1 Sy cardbus0 at cardslot0: bus 0 device 0...
Please note that this cardbus0 has a bus number
.Sq 0 ,
but normally the bus number 0 is used by the machine's
primary PCI bus.
Thus, this bus number for cardbus is incorrect
.Pq not assigned .
In this situation, a device located in cardbus0 doesn't
show correct device ID,
because its bus number 0 incorrectly refers to the primary
PCI bus, and a device ID in the primary PCI bus is shown
in the boot message instead of the device's ID in the cardbus0.
.Pp
This option assigns bus numbers for all subordinate
PCI buses and CardBuses.
.Pp
Since this option renumbers all PCI buses and CardBuses,
all bus numbers of subordinate buses become different
when this option is enabled.
.It Dv PCI_INTR_FIXUP
Fixup PCI interrupt routing via PCIBIOS or ACPI.
.Pp
Some i386 and amd64 BIOS implementations don't assign an interrupt for
some devices.
.Pp
This option assigns an interrupt for such devices instead
of relying upon the BIOS to do so.
.Pp
If a valid interrupt has already been assigned to a device, this
option leaves the interrupt as is.
