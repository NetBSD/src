.Sh NAME
.Nm pci
.Nd introduction to PCI bus machine-independent drivers and support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Pp
Machine-dependent; depends on the bus topology and PCI-bus interface
of your system. Typical PCI buses are connected to the
main system bus  via a PCI host bridge,  or daisy-chained
via a PCI-PCI bridge to an additional PCI bus.  See the
.Xr intro 4
documentation for your system for details.

.Sh INTRODUCTION
.Nx 1.2 
and later versions include  machine-independent bus support and
drivers for  the following PCI  bus devices.
Not all supported PCI devices are listed below.
Consult the
.Xr intro 4
section for your CPU for additional machine-dependent  drivers
(e.g., console drivers that support PCI video cards).
.Sh SUPPORTED DEVICES

Note that many PCI devices also have EISA, ISA, or ISA Plug-and-Play
variants. These are listed in 
.Xr eisa 4 ,
.Xr isa 4 ,
and
.Xr isapnp 4 ,
respectively.  The manual pages for each individual driver also lists the
supported bus variants.
