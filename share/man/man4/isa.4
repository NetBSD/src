.Sh NAME
.Nm isa
.Nd introduction to machine-independent ISA bus support and drivers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
Attachments are machine-dependent and depend on the bus topology and
.Tn ISA
bus interface of your system.
See
.Xr intro 4
for your system for details.

.Tn ISA
device drivers.
.Pp
Your system may support additional

.Pp
Note that some
.Tn ISA
devices also have newer
.Tn ISA
Plug-and-Play variants.
These are listed in
.Xr isapnp 4 .
Some i386 platforms use
.Xr pnpbios 4
to attach
.Tn ISA
devices.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "Stray interrupt on IRQ 7"
It means the interrupt controller reported an unmasked interrupt on IRQ
7, but no driver attached to that IRQ `claimed' it.
.Pp
There are two reasons this can happen:
.Bl -bullet
.It
In anything other than i386, it would almost always mean that there is a
driver attached to the IRQ, but it is the wrong driver.
.It
On i386, there is the more obscure issue of `default IRQ7's.
That is, when a device asserts an IRQ, but the IRQ is deasserted
after the PIC latches the interrupt and before the CPU acknowledges
it, the PIC just flat out lies about which IRQ it was.
It is usually due to a suboptimally coded driver.
