.Sh NAME
.Nm veriexec
.Nd Veriexec pseudo-device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd pseudo-device veriexec
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Em Veriexec
verifies the integrity of specified executables and files before they are
run or read.
This makes it much more difficult to insert a trojan horse into the system
and also makes it more difficult to run binaries that are not supposed to
be running, for example, packet sniffers, DDoS clients and so on.
.Pp
The
.Nm
pseudo-device is used to load and delete entries to and from the in-kernel
.Em Veriexec
databases, as well as query information about them.
It can also be used to dump the entire database.
.Ss Kernel-userland interaction
.Em Veriexec
uses
.Xr proplib 3
for communication between the kernel and userland.
.Bl -tag -width XXXX
.It Dv VERIEXEC_LOAD
Load an entry for a file to be monitored by
.Em Veriexec .
.Pp
The dictionary passed contains the following elements:
.Bl -column entryxtype string
.It Sy Name	Type	Purpose
.It file	string	filename for this entry
.It entry-type	uint8	entry type ( see below )
.It fp-type	string	fingerprint hashing algorithm
.It fp	data	the fingerprint
.El
.Pp
.Dq entry-type
can be one or more (binary-OR'd) of the following:
.Bl -column veriexecxuntrusted effect
.It Sy Type	Effect
.It Dv VERIEXEC_DIRECT	can execute directly
.It Dv VERIEXEC_INDIRECT	can execute indirectly (interpreter, Xr mmap 2 )
.It Dv VERIEXEC_FILE	can be opened
.It Dv VERIEXEC_UNTRUSTED	located on untrusted storage
.El
.It Dv VERIEXEC_DELETE
Removes either an entry for a single file or entries for an entire mount from
.Em Veriexec .
.Pp
The dictionary passed contains the following elements:
.Bl -column file string
.It Sy Name	Type	Purpose
.It file	string	filename or mount-point
.El
.It Dv VERIEXEC_DUMP
Dump the
.Em Veriexec
monitored files database from the kernel.
.Pp
Only files that the filename is kept for them will be dumped.
The returned array contains dictionaries with the following elements:
.Bl -column entryxtype string
.It Sy Name	Type	Purpose
.It file	string	filename
.It fp-type	string	fingerprint hashing algorithm
.It fp	data	the fingerprint
.It entry-type	uint8	entry type ( see above )
.El
.It Dv VERIEXEC_FLUSH
Flush the
.Em Veriexec
database, removing all entries.
.Pp
This command has no parameters.
.It Dv VERIEXEC_QUERY
Queries
.Em Veriexec
about a file, returning information that may be useful about it.
.Pp
The dictionary passed contains the following elements:
.Bl -column file string
.It Sy Name	Type	Purpose
.It file	string	filename
.El
.Pp
The dictionary returned contains the following elements:
.Bl -column entryxtype string
.It Sy Name	Type	Purpose
.It entry-type	uint8	entry type ( see above )
.It status	uint8	entry status
.It fp-type	string	fingerprint hashing algorithm
.It fp	data	the fingerprint
.El
.Pp
.Dq status
can be one of the following:
.Bl -column fingerprintxmismatch effect
.It Sy Status	Meaning
.It Dv FINGERPRINT_NOTEVAL	not evaluated
.It Dv FINGERPRINT_VALID	fingerprint match
.It Dv FINGERPRINT_MISMATCH	fingerprint mismatch
.El
.El
.Pp
Note that the requests
.Dv VERIEXEC_LOAD ,
.Dv VERIEXEC_DELETE ,
and
.Dv VERIEXEC_FLUSH
are not permitted once the strict level has been raised past 0.
