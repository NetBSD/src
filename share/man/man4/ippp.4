.Sh NAME
.Nm ippp
.Nd isdn synchronous PPP network driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device ippp" Ar count
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver interfaces the IP subsystem of the operating system with the
isdn layer so that a transport of IP packets over an ISDN link
is possible.
.Pp
For configuration of the
.Nm
driver, either the
.Xr ipppctl 8
utility is used or it is configured via
.Xr isdnd 8
and its associated
.Xr isdnd.rc 5
file.
.Pp
In case an IP packet for a remote side arrives in the driver and no
connection is established yet, the driver communicates with the
.Xr isdnd 8
daemon to establish a connection.
.Pp
The driver has support for interfacing to the
.Xr bpf 4
subsystem for using
.Xr tcpdump 8
with the
.Nm
interfaces.
.Pp
The
.Xr ipppctl 8
utility is used to configure all aspects of PPP required to connect to a
remote site.
.Sh LINK0 and LINK1
The
.Em link0
and
.Em link1
flags given as parameters to
.Xr ifconfig 8
have the following meaning for the
.Nm
devices:
.Bl -tag -width link0 -compact
.Pp
.It Li link0
wait passively for connection
.Pp
.It Li link1
auto-dial on output
.El
.Pp
The
.Em link0
and
.Em link1
flags are set to
.Em off
by default.
.Pp
See
.Xr sppp 4
for a more detailed discussion of the flags,
