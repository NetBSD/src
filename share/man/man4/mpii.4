.Sh NAME
.Nm mpii
.Nd LSI Logic Fusion-MPT Message Passing Interface II
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "mpii* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for storage controllers using the
LSI Logic Fusion-MPT Message Passing Interface II
family of chipsets:
.Pp
.Bl -dash -offset indent -compact
.It
LSISAS2004,
LSISAS2008
.El
.Pp
These chipsets can be found on the following controllers:
.Pp
.Bl -dash -offset indent -compact
.It
Dell PERC H200
.It
LSI SAS 9200-8e, SAS 9211-4i, SAS 9211-8i
.El
.Pp
Some models of these controllers have varying degrees of support for RAID 0
and RAID 1.
.Pp
.Nm
supports monitoring of the logical disks in the controller through the  
.Xr bioctl 8
and
.Xr envstat 8
commands.
.Sh EVENTS
The
.Nm
driver is able to send events to      
.Xr powerd 8
if a logical drive in the controller is not online.
The
.Em state-changed
event will be sent to the
.Pa /etc/powerd/scripts/sensor_drive  
script when such condition happens.

.Xr pci 4 ,

.Xr envstat 8 ,
.Xr powerd 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.7 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An James Giannoules
and
.An Mike Belopuhov .
.Sh BUGS
The chips supported by
.Nm
do not use a SCSI-like identifier.
Instead they use an opaque ID and leave discovery order up to the operating
system.
The code to handle this is currently not implemented and therefore it is not a
good idea to run this driver on a multi-boot machine or with more than 1 drive.
