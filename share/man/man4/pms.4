.Sh NAME
.Nm pms
.Nd PS/2 auxiliary port mouse driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd pckbc* at isa?
.Cd pms* at pckbc?
.Cd wsmouse* at pms?
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides an interface to PS/2 auxiliary port mice within the
.Xr wscons 4
framework. Parent device in terms of the autoconfiguration framework is
.Xr pckbc 4 ,
the PC keyboard controller.
.Dq pms
is a generic driver which supports mice using common variants of the PS/2
protocol, including wheel mice of the
.Dq IntelliMouse
breed.  Wheel movements are mapped to a third (z-) axis.  The driver is
believed to work with both 3-button and 5-button mice with scroll wheels.
Mice which use other protocol extensions are not currently supported, but
might be if protocol documentation could be found.
Mouse related data are accessed by
.Xr wsmouse 4
devices.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver has been updated to attempt to renegotiate mouse protocol after seeing
suspicious or defective mouse protocol packets, or unusual delays in the
middle of a packet; this should improve the chances that a mouse will recover
after being switched away or reset (for instance, by a console switch).
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr opms 4 ,
.Xr pckbc 4 ,
.Xr ums 4 ,
.Xr wsmouse 4
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was originally written by Christopher G. Demetriou.  The changes to
merge the
.Dq IntelliMouse
protocol in, and reset the mouse in the event of protocol problems, were
contributed by Peter Seebach.  Special thanks to Ray Trent, at Synaptics,
who contributed valuable insight into how to identify bogus mouse data.
.Sh BUGS
It is possible for the driver to mistakenly negotiate the non-scroll-wheel
protocol, after which it is unlikely to recover until the device is closed
and reopened.
