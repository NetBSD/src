.Sh BUGS
.Bl -bullet
.It
The
.Nm
driver just parses integer values from the
.Xr acpi 4
tree.
It could be more intelligent and parse other controls.
.It
The
.Xr sysctl 8
interface is not great.
The names of the
.Xr sysctl 8
tree are not self-explanatory.
.It
No validity checks are performed on the user input.
Playing with random values and/or unknown controls can harm your
machine.
.It
The name of the driver is too generic.
