.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Microchip Technology
MCP9805/98242 and other chips that conform to JEDEC Standard 21-C section
4.7.
Memory module temperature sensors are optional on DDR2 and newer DIMMs.
Sensors provided by this driver, including the on-chip thresholds for the
Alarm Window and Critical level, are accessed through the
.Xr envsys 4
API.
.Pp
The
.Nm
supports temperature ranges from -256 to +255 degrees C.
