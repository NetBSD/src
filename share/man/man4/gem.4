.Sh NAME
.Nm gem
.Nd ERI/GEM/GMAC Ethernet device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "gem* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "gem* at sbus? slot ? offset ?"
.Pp
Configuration of PHYs may also be necessary.
See
.Xr mii 4 .
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the GMac Ethernet hardware found mostly in
the last Apple PowerBooks G3s and most G4-based Apple hardware, as
well as many Sun UltraSPARCs.
.Pp
Cards supported by this driver include:
.Bl -bullet -compact -offset indent
.It
Sun GEM gigabit ethernet (including SX fibre variants)
.It
Sun ERI 10/100
.It
Apple GMAC
.El
.Pp
The GEM family supports hardware checksumming to assist in computing
IPv4 TCP checksums.
The
.Nm
driver supports this feature of the chip.
See
.Xr ifconfig 8
for information on how to enable this feature.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Nx 1.6 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Eduardo Horvath
.Aq eeh@NetBSD.org .
The man page was written by
.An Thomas Klausner
.Aq wiz@NetBSD.org .
.Sh BUGS
On the SX fibre variants of the hardware, the link will stay down if there is
a duplex mismatch.
Also, packet transmission may fail when in
.Cm half-duplex
mode.
