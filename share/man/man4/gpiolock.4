.Sh NAME
.Nm gpiolock
.Nd support for multi-position keylocks attached to GPIO pins
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "gpiolock* at gpio? offset ? mask ?"
.Cd "gpiolock* at gpio?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver allows connecting of multi-position keylocks over GPIO pins.
The keylock driver registers with an in-kernel keylock supporting system
and provides
.Xr kauth 9
support through an experimental security model.
The keylock state can be queried using the hw.keylock sysctl variables.
Only locks with 2-4 positions are currently supported.
The pin number is specified in the kernel configuration with the
.Ar offset
locator.
The
.Ar mask
locator denotes the pins used for the lock (minimum 2, maximum 4 pins are used).
The
.Ar offset
and
.Ar mask
can also be specified when
.Nm
is attached at runtime using the
.Dv GPIOATTACH
.Xr ioctl 2
on the
.Xr gpio 4
device.

The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Nx 6.0 .
