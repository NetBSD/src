.Sh NAME
.Nm umass
.Nd USB mass storage support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "umass*     at uhub?"
.Cd "atapibus*  at umass?"
.Cd "scsibus*   at umass? channel ?"
.Cd "wd*        at umass?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB mass storage class devices.
The driver supports subclasses SCSI, 8020i (ATAPI), 8070i (ATAPI), QIC157 (ATAPI), RBC (subset of SCSI), and UFI (USB Floppy).
The driver handles the protocols Bulk-Only, CBI, and CBI-with-CCI.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver is a port of the
.Fx
driver.
The
.Nm
driver appeared in
.Nx 1.5 .
.Sh NOTES
The driver has some support for certain adapters from In-System
Design that use the (non-standardized) ATA protocol over Bulk-Only.
This hardware is very rare, and the support very likely no longer
works after ATA subsystem redesign to support NCQ on October 7, 2017.
