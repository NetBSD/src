.Sh NAME
.Nm cgfourteen
.Nd Sun accelerated 8/24-bit color frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "cgfourteen* at obio?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm cgfourteen
is a memory based color frame buffer, with graphics acceleration and
overlay capabilities.
Its pixel memory can be mapped into a user process address space by using
the
.Xr mmap 2
system call.
The
.Nm
driver supports the minimal ioctl's needed to run
.Xr Xorg 1 .
.Pp
The driver operates by default in
.Xr sparc/cgthree 4
emulation mode, i.e.
in 8-bit unaccelerated mode.
This emulation does include support for the hardware cursor present on the
.Nm cgfourteen ,
however.
