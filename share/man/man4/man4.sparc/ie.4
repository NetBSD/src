.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to the 10 Mb/s Ethernet network via the
.Tn Intel
82586
Ethernet chip set.
The
.Nm
is found as an on-board interface on Sun 4/100 and 4/200 workstations.
The
.Nm
also exists as a VME card.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network.
