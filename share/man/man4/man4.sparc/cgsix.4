.Sh NAME
.Nm cgsix
.Nd Sun accelerated 8-bit color frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "cgsix* at sbus? slot ? offset ?" Pq sun4c/sun4m
.Cd "cgsix0 at obio0 addr 0xfb000000 level 4" Pq sun4/300

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm cgsix
is a memory based color frame buffer.
It supports the minimal ioctl's needed to run
.Xr X 1 .

.Sh BUGS
Several firmware revisions on
.Nm
boards have a terminal emulation bug that shows up when using the
screen control sequences for inserting blank lines
near the bottom end of the screen
(i.e., the control sequences produced by the
.So al Sc and So AL Sc
capabilities found in the
.Xr termcap 5
database).
The most likely occasion for triggering
this bug is to use a full-screen editor such as
.Xr vi 1
on the workstation's console.
.Pp
To work around this you can set your
.Ev TERM
environment variable to the
.Sq sun-cgsix
terminal definition which is the same as the
.Sq sun
entry, except that the
.Sq al
and
.Sq AL
capabilities have been removed (at the cost of making the scrolling of
the screen slower).
