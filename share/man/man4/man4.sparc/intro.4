.Sh NAME
.Nm intro
.Nd introduction to sparc special files and hardware support
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This section describes the special files, related driver functions,
and networking support
available in the system.
In this part of the manual, the
.Tn SYNOPSIS
section of
each configurable device gives a sample specification
for use in constructing a system description for the
.Xr config 1
program.
The
.Tn DIAGNOSTICS
section lists messages which may appear on the console
and/or in the system error log
.Pa /var/log/messages
due to errors in device operation;
see
.Xr syslogd 8
for more information.
.Pp
This section contains both devices
which may be configured into the system
and network related information.
The networking support is introduced in
.Xr netintro 4 .
.Sh DEVICE SUPPORT
This section describes the hardware supported on the SPARC
platform.
Software support for these devices comes in two forms.
A hardware device may be supported with a character or block
.Em device driver ,
or it may be used within the networking subsystem and have a
.Em network interface driver .
Block and character devices are accessed through files in the file
system of a special type; see
.Xr mknod 8 .
Network interfaces are indirectly accessed through the interprocess
communication facilities provided by the system; see
.Xr socket 2 .
.Pp
A hardware device is identified to the system at configuration time
and the appropriate device or network interface driver is then compiled
into the system.
When the resultant system is booted, the
autoconfiguration facilities in the system probe for the device
and, if found, enable the software support for it.
If a device does not respond at autoconfiguration
time it is not accessible at any time afterwards.
To enable a device which did not autoconfigure,
the system must be rebooted.
.Pp
The autoconfiguration system is described in
.Xr sparc/autoconf 4 .
A list of the supported devices is given below.

.Sh SUPPORTED SYSTEMS
The following Sun SPARC system architectures and models are supported:
.Bl -tag -width speaker
.It sun4
first generation SPARC systems on VMEbus:
.br
Sun 4/100 series (14.28 MHz)
.br
Sun 4/200 series (16.67 MHz)
.br
Sun 4/300 series (25 MHz)
.It sun4c
desktop SPARC systems with Sbus:
.br
SPARCstation 1 (20 MHz)
.br
SPARCstation 1+ (25 MHz)
.br
SPARCstation 2 (40 MHz)
.br
SPARCstation SLC (20 MHz)
.br
SPARCstation ELC (33 MHz)
.br
SPARCstation IPC (25 MHz)
.br
SPARCstation IPX (40 MHz).
.It sun4m
desktop SPARC systems with Mbus for CPUs, and Sbus:
.br
SPARCclassic (50 MHz microSPARC I)
.br
SPARCstation LX (50 MHz microSPARC I)
.br
SPARCstation 4 (70 MHz microSPARC II)
.br
SPARCstation 5 (70, 85, 110 MHz microSPARC II)
.br
SPARCstation 5 (170 MHz TurboSPARC)
.br
SPARCstation 10M (36 MHz SuperSPARC I)
.br
SPARCstation 20M (50 MHz SuperSPARC I)
.br
SPARCstation 10 (Mbus modules)
.br
SPARCstation 20 (Mbus modules)
.El
.Pp
The SPARCstation 2 and IPX can be upgraded with a Weitek PowerUP CPU
that is clock-doubled (i.e. internally it runs at 80 MHz).
.Nx
supports this configuration.
.Pp
Hardware level clones of these systems from other manufacturers
will likely work (e.g. Xerox, Tatung, Axil, Cycle);
other systems which have a SPARC CPU but do not
use Sun's hardware architecture (e.g. Solbourne) will likely not work.
.Pp
The sun4m architecture with Mbus modules for the CPUs is supported
with the following modules with only one CPU:
.Bl -tag -width speaker
.It SM41
40 MHz SuperSPARC I with 1MB SuperCACHE
.It SM51
50 MHz SuperSPARC I with 1MB SuperCACHE
.It SM61
60 MHz SuperSPARC I with 1MB SuperCACHE
.It SM71
75 MHz SuperSPARC II with 1MB SuperCACHE
.It SM81
85 MHz SuperSPARC II with 1MB SuperCACHE
.It HS11
100 MHz Ross Technology hyperSPARC
.It HS21
125 MHz Ross Technology hyperSPARC
.It M151
150 MHz Ross Technology hyperSPARC
.El
.Pp
This list is not exhaustive;
.Nx
is continuously being improved, and may well run on Mbus CPU modules
not listed here.
.Pp
There is also some support for Sun
.Tn JavaStation
computers based on the microSPARC CPU.
.Pp
.Nx
does not yet properly support multiprocessor systems,
but will run on one processor of a multiprocessor system.
.Pp
The Sun 4/400 series, and sun4d (SPARCcenter 1000, 1000E, and
2000) are not supported.
.Pp
The sun4u (UltraSPARC 64-bit) architectures are supported by
.Nx Ns Tn /sparc64 .
