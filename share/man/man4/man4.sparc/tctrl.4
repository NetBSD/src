.Sh NAME
.Nm tctrl
.Nd Tadpole Microcontroller Interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "tctrl0 at obio0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides control over many functions on the
.Tn Tadpole SPARCbook
3 series laptops, via their TS102 chip.
The microcontroller is used to power the TFT display down when the
laptop lid is closed and when the screen is blanked by the
.Xr sparc/pnozz 4
driver.
The
.Nm tctrl
is also used to power the laptop off when the
.Xr reboot 2
system call is used with the
.Ar RB_POWERDOWN
flag is set.
Power button events are forwarded to
.Xr powerd 8 .
The PCMCIA part of the controller is supported by
.Xr sparc/tslot 4 .
