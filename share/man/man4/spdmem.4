.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for generic memory module Serial Presence Detect.
During kernel boot it displays module type, and where possible, the size and
rated speed of the memory module.
Additional information such as bank configuration and width is
printed if the kernel is booted in verbose mode.
.Pp
The Serial Presence Detect data for each memory module is also made accessible
to user mode via
.Xr sysctl 8 .
An entry for each
.Nm
device is created under the
.Dv hw
top-level MIB.
.Pp
Some SPD ROMs also have a temperature sensor.
It's supported by
.Xr sdtemp 4 .
