.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver supports
.Tn Dino
and
.Tn Cujo
Host/PCI bridges found in [ABC][0-9][0-9][0-9]-Class workstations and
GSC / HSC cards.
.Tn Cujo
is a 64 bit datapath version of
.Tn Dino .
.Pp
On some machines it may also provide an additional serial port through the
.Xr com 4
driver, or
.Tn PS/2
keyboard and mouse ports, though the latter are not yet supported.
