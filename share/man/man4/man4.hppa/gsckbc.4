.Sh NAME
.Nm gsckbc
.Nd GSC PS/2 keyboard and mouse interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "gsckbc* at gsc?"
.Cd "pckbd*  at gsckbc?"
.Cd "pms*    at gsckbc?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device is a machine dependent front end to the
.Xr pckbport 9
interface.
It attaches to the GSC PS/2 keyboard and mouse interface found in LASI chips.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "gsckbc_attach: can't map I/O space"
The driver was not able to map the device registers during attachment.
The device will not be usable.
.It "can't find master device"
An error occurred during attachment of the keyboard port so the mouse port
can't be attached too.

.Sh BUGS
Actually the two PS/2 ports are a single device and share a single interrupt.
The firmware lists them as individual devices in the firmware device tree.
This illusion is kept to map the firmware device tree as close as possible
to the kernel device tree.
The first device is caled master, gets the interrupt and the other is the
slave.
Assumption: Master attaches first, gets the interrupt and has lower HPA.
So it is important that the master device, usually the keyboard port,
attaches first to make the slave, usually the mouse port, usable.
