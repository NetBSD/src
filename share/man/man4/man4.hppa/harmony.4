.Sh NAME
.Nm harmony
.Nd CS4215/AD1849 audio interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "harmony* at gsc?"
.Cd "audio*   at harmony?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device uses the
.Tn Crystal Semiconductor
.Tn CS4215
16-Bit Multimedia Audio Codec
or
.Tn Analog Devices
.Tn AD1849
.Tn SoundPort(R) Stereo Codec
chip to implement the audio device interface described in
.Xr audio 4 .
This device is found on most
.Tn HP PA-RISC
workstations.
The
.Nm
has a maximum precision of 16 bits and has a stereo input and stereo output.
.Pp
On
.Tn HP 9000/712
models
.Nm
also provides two additional channels for an add-on
card with two fax/voice modems.
.Pp
One of the hardware registers reflects the state of the
.Tn CHI
bus that is used to communicate with the codec and thus
being sampled at a low accuracy secondary frequency
(such as
.Xr timeout 9 )
produces poor quality random bit stream that is fed into the
entropy pool of
.Xr rnd 4 .

.Sh HISTORY
Support for
.Nm
first appeared in
.Ox 3.3 .
It was ported to
.Nx 1.6
by Chuck Silvers.
.Sh CAVEATS
To trigger entropy collection
.Tn CHI
bus has to be programmed into the data mode that happens once
a single buffer of data has been played or recorded.
