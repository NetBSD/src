.Sh NAME
.Nm gsc
.Nd General System Connect bus on
.Tn HP 9000/700
machines
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "gsc* at lasi?"
.Cd "gsc* at asp?"
.Cd "gsc* at wax?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This is the core I/O bus for all HP 9000/700 workstations.
All I/O subsystems connect to this bus.
The devices can be either on separate chips, expansion
cards or on an integrated megacell, like the LASI MBA.
.Pp
The
.Tn GSC
bus is a 32-bit wide, address and data multiplexed bus.
In its "standard" implementation it has a maximum throughput of 160MB/s,
the "2x" implementation reaches up to 250MB/s.
Some HPPA CPUs directly attach to this bus, namely the PA7100LC and PA7300LC.
.Pp
As for the expansion cards, there are different form-factors, depending on
bus-speed (standard or 2x) and specific models.
The standard formfactor is the "EISA form-factor"; cards that look like
typical EISA cards with a different connector (100-pin female EBBL).
The Series 712 have their own special type
of GSC expansion cards, called the "GIO form-factor", which is quite small and
mostly has only one VLSI chip on it (in most cases LASI/WAX).
Newer systems sometimes feature the "HSC formfactor", which is a 1U-VME
card-like expansion card with a 100-pin male pin+socket connector.
Mixing cards with different speeds is supported but downgrades
the performance of the whole I/O-subsystem.
.Sh SUPPORTED DEVICES
