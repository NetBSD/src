.Dt MEM 4 hppa
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mem ,
.Nm kmem
.Nd memory files and memory controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "mem* at mainbus0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver controls and restricts access to the systems memory
by the hardware buses and the processor.
.Pp
It also provides an interface to userland through the special files
.Pa /dev/mem
and
.Pa /dev/kmem .
Physical memory is accessed through
.Pa /dev/mem ,
while kernel virtual memory is accessed through
.Pa /dev/kmem .
Access to kernel virtual addresses not currently mapped to memory will fail.
On hppa, the physical memory range is always contiguous and starts at
address 0; kernel virtual memory begins at address 0 as well.
.Pp
The writeability of the
.Pa /dev/mem
and
.Pa /dev/kmem
special files are controlled by the system securelevel in addition to the
filesystem permissions.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/kmem -compact
.It Pa /dev/mem
.It Pa /dev/kmem
.El
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver originates from
.Ox .
It was ported to
.Nx 1.6
by Matthew Fredette.
.Sh BUGS
On some systems featuring a
.Dq Viper
memory controller,
.Nx
may not configure bus arbitration correctly, causing the boot process
to freeze during either
.Nm
or
.Xr cpu 4
device probe.
