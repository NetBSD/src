.Sh NAME
.Nm ubsec
.Nd Broadcom and BlueSteel uBsec 5x0x crypto accelerator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ubsec* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports cards containing any of the following chips:
.Bl -tag -width "Broadcom BCM5821" -offset indent
.It Bluesteel 5501
The original chipset, no longer made.
This extremely rare unit
was not very fast, lacked an RNG, and had a number of other bugs.
.It Broadcom BCM5801
A BCM5805 without public key engine or random number generator.
.It Broadcom BCM5802
A slower version of the BCM5805.
.It Broadcom BCM5805
Faster version of Bluesteel 5601.
.It Broadcom BCM5820
64 bit version of the chip, and significantly more advanced.
.It Broadcom BCM5821
Faster version of the BCM5820.
This is the chip found on the Sun Crypto Accelerator 1000.
.It Broadcom BCM5822
Faster version of the BCM5820.
.It Broadcom BCM5823
Faster version of the BCM5822 that also supports AES.
.It Broadcom BCM5825
Faster PCI Express or PCI-X version of the chip.
.It Broadcom BCM5860
IPSec/SSL Security Processor that is faster and has more features.
.It Broadcom BCM5861
Faster version of the BCM5860.
.It Broadcom BCM5862
Faster version of the BCM5861.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver registers itself to accelerate DES, Triple-DES, MD5, SHA1,
MD5-HMAC, and SHA1-HMAC operations for
.Xr opencrypto 9 ,
and thus for
.Xr ipsec 4
and
.Xr crypto 4 .
The driver also supports acceleration of AES-CBC with the BCM5823 or newer.
.Pp
On those models which contain a public key engine (almost all of the
more recent ones), this feature is registered with the
.Xr crypto 4
subsystem.
.Pp
On all models except the Bluesteel 5501 and Broadcom 5801, the driver
registers itself to provide random data to the
.Xr rnd 4
subsystem.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Ox 2.8 .
The
.Nm
device driver was imported to
.Fx 5.0 ,
back-ported to
.Fx 4.8 ,
and subsequently imported to
.Nx 2.0 .
.Sh BUGS
The BCM5801 and BCM5802 have not actually been tested.
