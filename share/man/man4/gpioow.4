.Dt GPIOOW 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm gpioow
.Nd 1-Wire bus bit-banging through GPIO pin
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "gpioow* at gpio? offset 0 mask 0x1"
.Cd "gpioow* at gpio?"
.Cd "onewire* at gpioow?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver allows bit-banging a 1-Wire bus as a master using one GPIO pin.
The pin is used as a data signal.
The GPIO pin must be able to drive an output and read an input.
.Pp
The pin number is specified in the kernel configuration with the
.Ar offset
locator.
The
.Ar mask
locator should always be 0x1.
The
.Ar offset
and
.Ar mask
can also be specified when
.Nm
is attached at runtime using the
.Dv GPIOATTACH
.Xr ioctl 2
on the
.Xr gpio 4
device.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr gpio 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr onewire 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.0
and
.Nx 4.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Alexander Yurchenko Aq Mt grange@openbsd.org
and was ported to
.Nx
by
.An Jeff Rizzo Aq Mt riz@NetBSD.org .
