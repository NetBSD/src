.Nm siop
.Nd Symbios Logic/NCR 53c8xx SCSI driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ss hppa
.Cd "siop* at mainbus? irq 3"
.Cd "siop* at phatomas? irq 3"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Symbios Logic/NCR 53x8xx series of
.Tn SCSI
controller chips:
.Pp
.Bl -dash -compact -offset indent
.It
53c810, 53c810a and 53c815 (Fast
.Tn SCSI )
.It
53c820, 53c825 and 53c825a (Fast-Wide
.Tn SCSI )
.It
53c860 (Ultra
.Tn SCSI )
.It
53c875 and 53c875j (Ultra-Wide
.Tn SCSI )
.It
53c876 (Dual Ultra-Wide
.Tn SCSI )
.It
53c885 (Ultra-Wide
.Tn SCSI
and
.Tn Ethernet )
.It
53c895 (Ultra2-Wide
.Tn SCSI )
.It
53c896 (PCI 64bit, dual Ultra2-Wide
.Tn SCSI )
.It
53c1010-33 (PCI 64bit, dual Ultra160
.Tn SCSI )
.It
53c1510d (PCI 64bit, dual Ultra2-wide
.Tn SCSI )
.El
The SIOP_SYMLED option causes the driver to report SCSI activity on the GPIO
pin 1, which is connected to the activity LED on some adapters.
At this time only the 53c895 based Symbios and Tekram adapters are
known to require this.
.Pp
If both
.Nm
and the
.Xr esiop 4
drivers are compiled,
.Xr esiop 4
will take precedence for controllers it supports.

The
.Nm
driver was written by Manuel Bouyer
.Aq Manuel.Bouyer@lip6.fr
for
.Nx .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
supports the 53c1010-33 in Ultra2-wide mode only.
Use
.Xr esiop 4
for Ultra160 support.
