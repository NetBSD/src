.Sh NAME
.Nm ixg
.Nd Intel(R) 10Gb Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ixg* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for PCI 10Gb Ethernet adapters based on
the Intel(R) 82598EB, 82599, X540 and X550 Ethernet Controllers.
The driver supports Jumbo Frames, TCP Segmentation Offload (TSO).
.Pp
For questions related to hardware requirements,
refer to the documentation supplied with your Intel 10GbE adapter.
All hardware requirements listed apply to use with
.Nx .
.Pp
Support for Jumbo Frames is provided via the interface MTU setting.
Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the
.Xr ifconfig 8
utility configures the adapter to receive and transmit Jumbo Frames.
On
.Nx ,
the maximum MTU size for Jumbo Frames is 9000 bytes.
.Pp
This driver version supports VLANs.
For information on enabling VLANs, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "ixg%d: Unable to allocate bus resource: memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "ixg%d: Unable to allocate bus resource: interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "ixg%d: watchdog timeout -- resetting"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).
.El
.Sh SUPPORT
For general information and support,
go to the Intel support website at:
.Lk http://www.intel.com/support/ .
.\" .Pp
.\" If an issue is identified with the released source code on the supported kernel
.\" with a supported adapter, email the specific information related to the
.\" issue to
.\" .Aq freebsdnic@mailbox.intel.com .

.Xr ifconfig 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver comes from
.Fx ,
where it is called
.Nm ixgbe .
It first appeared in
.Nx 6.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Intel Corporation Aq Mt freebsdnic@mailbox.intel.com .
It was imported from
.Fx
into
.Nx
by
.An David Young Aq Mt dyoung@NetBSD.org .
.Sh BUGS
The hardware supports a maximum MTU of 16114 bytes, but the
.Nx
port of the driver supports only 9000 bytes.
