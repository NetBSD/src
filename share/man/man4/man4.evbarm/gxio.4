.Sh NAME
.Nm gxio
.Nd driver for Gumstix onboard I/O interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "gxio* at pxaip?"
.Cd options GXIO_BLUETOOTH_ON_HWUART
.Cd options GXIO_DEFAULT_EXPANSION
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports several different expansion boards.
Those boards have to be configured either by kernel option or
using boot time parameter.
The supported extension boards is system specific.
.Pp
.Nm
is available for OMAP based Overo/DouVero and Pepper
as well as for XScale based Gumstix boards.
To setup the expansion board on boot the parameter
.Dq expansion
for OMAP and XScale can be used.
Additionally, some XScale systems can connect two expansion boards.
The second board can be configured by the
.Dq busheader
boot parameter.
The
.Nm
driver does not verify validity of both parameters.
.Pp
For Xscale boards the following drivers are available for the peripherals:
.Bl -tag -width -pcdisplay -offset indent
.It sm
SMC91Cxx ethernet interface.
.It smsh
SMSC LAN9118/LAN9218 ethernet interface.
.El
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width GXIO_BLUETOOTH_ON_HWUART -offset 3n
.It Dv GXIO_BLUETOOTH_ON_HWUART
Uses HWUART pins for Bluetooth module.
.Pp
The option only affects Xscale PXA250 based Gumstix boards.
If set, the serial port HWUART is used to control Bluetooth module.
Otherwise no Bluetooth module is configured for PXA250 boards.
.It Dv GXIO_DEFAULT_EXPANSION
Static configuration of expansion board.
.Pp
If configured, the
.Nm
of the processor is setup for the board.
If a boot parameter is used, the boot value is used instead.
.Pp
For Xscale based boards the following values are supported:
.Bl -column
.It basix
.It cfstix
.It etherstix
.It netcf
.It netcf-vx
