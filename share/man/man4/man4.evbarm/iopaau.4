.Sh NAME
.Nm iopaau
.Nd Intel I/O Processor Application Accelerator Unit
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd iopxs* at mainbus?
.Cd iopaau* at iopxs?
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Application Accelerator Unit, or AAU, provides hardware-assisted
support for performing block fills on a region of memory, XOR of
multiple regions of memory
.Pq parity computation ,
and parity verification.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the Application Accelerator Units on the following
Intel I/O Processors:
.Bl -bullet
.\" .It
.\" Intel i80312 Companion I/O
.\" .Pq IOP310
.It
Intel i80321 I/O Processor
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides a back-end to the
.Xr dmover 9
interface, and supports the following
.Xr dmover 9
functions:
.Bl -tag -width "fill8XX"
.It zero
Zero a region of memory
.It fill8
Fill a region of memory with an 8-bit value
.It copy
Copy a region of memory
.It xor2
Perform an XOR of 2 input streams
.It xor3
Perform an XOR of 3 input streams
.It xor4
Perform an XOR of 4 input streams
.It xor5
Perform an XOR of 5 input streams
.It xor6
Perform an XOR of 6 input streams
.It xor7
Perform an XOR of 7 input streams
.It xor8
Perform an XOR of 8 input streams
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr dmover 9
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device first appeared in
.Nx 2.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Jason R. Thorpe Aq Mt thorpej@wasabisystems.com
and contributed by Wasabi Systems, Inc.
.Sh BUGS
Due to limitations in how scatter-gather is done by the AAU hardware,
a given DMA segment must be the same length for the output stream and
each input stream.  The easiest way to achieve this is to ensure that
all streams used in an AAU operation begin at the same offset into a
page.
