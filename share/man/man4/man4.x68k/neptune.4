.Sh NAME
.Nm neptune
.Nd Neptune-X ISA bridge driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "neptune0 at intio0 addr 0xece000 irq 239"
.Cd "ne0 at neptune? addr 0x300"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Neptune-X is a Ethernet interface card initially designed by
Hirofumi Shimada, which uses popular NE2000 or its clone with its
own x68k-proprietary bus to ISA bus bridge.
.Pp
The
.Nx
.Nm
driver takes charge of the ISA bridge part of the Neptune-X.
It is implemented as a more generic `bus' with its own
.Xr bus_space 9
interface, and is intended to be used with
.Xr ne 4
driver.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr isa 4 ,
.Xr ne 4 ,
.Xr x68k/intro 4 ,
.Xr bus_space 9
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device appeared in
.Nx 1.4 .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
itself is always detected when it is specified in the kernel config file.
This is because the Neptune-X ISA bridge is transparent to software.
The attached device is detected appropriately.
