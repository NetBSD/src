.Sh NAME
.Nm intio
.Nd X68K internal I/O space driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "intio0 at mainbus0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a virtual device corresponding to the x68k internal I/O space.
.Pp
Internal I/O space spans from 0xc00000 to 0xffffff of the x68k
physical address space, and is mapped permanently in the kernel virtual space
at the very early time of the kernel startup procedure.
.Pp
.Nm
driver manages the internal I/O space of x68k.
.Pp

.It
Address range management to avoid confliction of address space of
which devices probe by touching hardware port is difficult.
.It
Interrupt vector management.
