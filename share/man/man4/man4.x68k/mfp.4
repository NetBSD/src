.Sh NAME
.Nm mfp
.Nd X68K Multi-function Peripherals
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd mfp0 at intio0 addr 0xe88000 size 0x2000 intr 64
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
drives Motorola MC68901 MFP (Multi-function Peripheral).
.Nm
driver is always required to run the
.Nx Ns /x68k
kernel, because it is connected to important devices such as
the display controller, and provides fundamental functions
like the system clock tick and interrupt controller.
Since
.Nm
provides many functions, most of the jobs as a
device driver is done by its child drivers such as
.Xr kbd 4
and
.Xr clock 4 .
.Nm
driver itself only provides the common way to access its
registers and a few utility functions for other non-child drivers.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr clock 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr kbd 4
.Sh BUGS
Machine-dependent part and machine-independent part should be split.
