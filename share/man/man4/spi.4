.Dt SPI 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm spi
.Nd introduction to machine-independent SPI bus support and drivers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "spi* at mainbus?"
.Pp
Other attachments are machine-dependent and will depend on the bus topology
of your system.
See
.Xr intro 4
for your system for more information.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nx
includes a machine dependent
.Tn SPI
(Serial Peripheral Interface) bus subsystem, and several different
machine-independent
.Tn SPI
device drivers.
.Pp
Your system may support additional machine-dependent SPI devices.
Consult your system's
.Xr intro 4
for additional information.
.Pp
.Tn SPI
is a 4-wire synchronous full-duplex serial bus.
Some systems provide support for
.Tn Microwire ,
which is
.Tn Philips'
name for a strict subset of SPI, with more rigidly defined signaling.
Therefore,
.Tn Microwire
devices are also supported by the
.Tn SPI
framework.
.Pp
Note that when referencing
.Tn SPI
devices in a
.Xr config 1
file, the
.Sq slave
must be provided, as
.Tn SPI
lacks any way to automatically probe devices.
.Sh HARDWARE
.Nx
includes the following machine-independent
.Tn SPI
drivers
.Bl -tag -width pcdisplay -offset indent
.It m25p
STMicroelectronics M25P family of NOR flash devices.
.It mcp23s17gpio
Microchip MCP23S17 16-bit GPIO chip.
.It mcp3kadc
Microchip MCP3x0x SAR analog to digital converter.
.It mcp48x1dac
Microchip MCP4801/MCP4811/MCP4821 digital to analog converter.
.It tm121temp
Texas Instruments TMP121 temperature sensor.

.Sh HISTORY
The machine-independent
.Tn SPI
framework was written by
.An Garrett D'Amore
for the
Champaign-Urbana Community Wireless Network Project (CUWiN), and
appeared in
.Nx 4.0 .
