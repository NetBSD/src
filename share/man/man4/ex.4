.Pp
All versions of the
.Tn EtherLink XL
.Pq except the older 3c900 and 3c905
support IPv4/TCP/UDP checksumming in hardware.
The
.Nm
driver supports this feature of the chip.
See
.Xr ifconfig 8
for information on how to enable this feature.
.Sh MEDIA SELECTION
Some of these network interfaces support the Media Independent Interface
.Pq Tn MII ,
a bus which can have at least one arbitrary Physical interface
.Pq Tn PHY
chip on it.
.Nx
supports
.Tn MII
and has separate drivers for many different
.Tn PHY
chips, including
.Xr ukphy 4 ,
a generic
.Tn PHY
driver that can support many
.Tn PHY
chips that
.Nx
does not yet have a specific driver for.
.Pp
Support for the
.Tn PHY
found on a given
.Tn NIC
must be configured into a
.Nx
kernel
.Xr config 1
for this driver to work properly in those cases.
.Pp
See
.Xr ifmedia 4 ,
and
.Xr mii 4 .
