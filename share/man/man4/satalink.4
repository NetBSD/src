.Sh NAME
.Nm satalink
.Nd Silicon Image SATALink disk controller driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "satalink* at pci? dev ? function ? flags 0x0000"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the Silicon Image SATALink 3112 2-port and 3114 4-port
Serial ATA controllers, and provides the interface with the hardware for
the
.Xr ata 4
driver.
.Pp
The 0x0002 flag forces the
.Nm
driver to disable DMA on chipsets for which DMA would normally be
enabled.
This can be used as a debugging aid, or to work around
problems where the SATA controller is wired up to the system incorrectly.
