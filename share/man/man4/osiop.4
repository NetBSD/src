.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the
.Tn Symbios/NCR
53C710
.Tn SCSI
controller chip.
.Pp
For the
.Tn Symbios/NCR
53C700
.Tn SCSI
host adapters, use the
.Xr oosiop 4
driver.
.Pp
For the
.Tn Symbios/NCR
53C8xx
.Tn PCI
.Tn SCSI
host adapters, use the
.Xr siop 4
or
.Xr esiop 4
driver.
.Sh CONFIGURATION
The
.Nm
driver supports the following
.Sy flags
for use in
.Xr config 1
files:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width "bits 8-15:"
.It bits 0-7 :
disable disconnect/reselect for the corresponding
.Tn SCSI
target
.It bits 8-15 :
disable synchronous negotiation for
.Tn SCSI
target
.It bits 16 :
disable DMA interrupts
.El
.Pp
.Qq Target
is synonymous with
.Tn SCSI
ID number.
.Pp
Note that
.Tn SCSI
tape drives should be allowed to perform disconnect/reselect or performance
will suffer.
.\" .Sh BUGS
.\" Neither
.\" .Tn DMA
.\" or synchronous data transfers are currently supported.
