.Sh NAME
.Nm acpifan
.Nd ACPI Fan
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "acpifan* at acpi?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports fans possibly exposed by the
.Tn BIOS .
Even if a system contains only one physical fan, multiple
.Nm
instances may be present.
In such cases each
.Nm
typically represents an
.Xr acpitz 4
thermal zone, and the combined state of all
instances reveals the speed of the fan.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver does not support controlling the fan.
The current state (on or off) is made available through the
.Xr envsys 4
.Tn API
and the
.Xr envstat 8
command.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr acpi 4 ,
.Xr acpitz 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Nx 6.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Jukka Ruohonen
.Aq jruohonen@iki.fi
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver does not yet support additional functionality introduced in the
.Tn ACPI
4.0 specification.
