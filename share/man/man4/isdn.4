.Sh NAME
.Nm isdn
.Nd ISDN kernel to userland master device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device isdn"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver is used by the
.Xr isdnd 8
daemon to exchange messages with the ISDN kernel part for the purpose
of call establishment, control and disconnection and to access various
control and status information.
.Pp
The messages and message parameters are documented in the include
file
.Pa /usr/include/netisdn/i4b_ioctl.h .
.Pp
The available ioctl's are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact -offset indent
.It Ar I4B_CDID_REQ
Request a unique Call Description IDentifier (cdid) which identifies
uniquely a single interaction of the local D channel with the exchange.
.It Ar I4B_CONNECT_REQ
Actively request a call setup to a remote ISDN subscriber.
.It Ar I4B_CONNECT_RESP
Respond to an incoming call, either accept, reject or ignore it.
.It Ar I4B_DISCONNECT_REQ
Actively terminate a connection.
.It Ar I4B_CTRL_INFO_REQ
Request information about an installed ISDN controller card.
.It Ar I4B_DIALOUT_RESP
Give information about call setup to driver who requested dialing out.
.It Ar I4B_TIMEOUT_UPD
Update the kernels timeout value(s) in case of dynamically calculated
shorthold mode timing changes.
.It Ar I4B_UPDOWN_IND
Inform the kernel userland drivers about interface soft up/down status
changes.
.It Ar I4B_CTRL_DOWNLOAD
Download firmware to active card(s).
.It Ar I4B_ACTIVE_DIAGNOSTIC
Return diagnostic information from active cards.
.El
.Pp
Status and event messages available from the kernel are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact -offset indent
.It Ar MSG_CONNECT_IND
An incoming call from a remote ISDN user is indicated.
.It Ar MSG_CONNECT_ACTIVE_IND
After an incoming call has been accepted locally or an outgoing call has
been accepted by a remote, the exchange signaled an active connection
and the corresponding B-channel is switched through.
.It Ar MSG_DISCONNECT_IND
A call was terminated.
.It Ar MSG_DIALOUT_IND
A userland interface driver requests the daemon to dial out (typically a
network interface when a packet arrives in its send queue).
.It Ar MSG_IDLE_TIMEOUT_IND
A call was terminated by the isdn4bsd kernel driver because a B-channel
idle timeout occurred.
.It Ar MSG_ACCT_IND
Accounting information from a network driver.
.It Ar MSG_CHARGING_IND
Charging information from the kernel.
