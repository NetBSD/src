.Sh NAME
.Nm cnw
.Nd
.Tn Netwave AirSurfer Wireless network driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "cnw*     at pcmcia? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm cnw
interface provides access to a theoretical 1 Mb/s wireless Ethernet network
based on the Netwave AirSurfer Wireless LAN (formerly known as the Xircom
Netwave Wireless LAN).
.Pp
Note that the driver does not support newer devices
such as the Netwave AirSurfer
.Dq Plus ,
or the BayStack 650/660, which can use the
.Xr awi 4
driver.
.Pp
It use 32K of I/O memory mapped to the card along with either 16 I/O ports
or 4K of additional I/O memory for access to command registers.  The
driver currently only supports the use of the additional 4K of I/O memory.
You may need to increase memory space available to the PCMCIA controller.
See
.Xr pcmcia 4
for details.
.Pp
In use, the cards appear to achieve up to a 420Kb/s transfer rate, though
a transfer rate between 250Kb/s and 350Kb/s is typical.  The card
operates in the 2.4Ghz frequency range and is subject to interference
from microwaves as well as earth.
.Sh HARDWARE
Cards supported by the
.Nm
driver include:
.Pp
.Bl -item -offset indent
.It
Xircom CreditCard Netwave
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "cnw0: can't map memory"
Indicates that the driver was not able to allocate 32Kbytes of PCMCIA bus
address space into which to map the device.
See
.Xr pcmcia 4
and increase memory available to the PCMCIA controller.
