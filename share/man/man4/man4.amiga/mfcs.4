serial communications interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "mfc0 at mainbus0"
.Cd "mfcs0 at mfc0 unit 0"
.Cd "mfcs1 at mfc0 unit 1"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Tn MultiFaceCard II/III
controls, among other things, a dual port
.Tn EIA
.Tn RS-232C
.Pf ( Tn CCITT
.Tn V.28 )
communications interface with a multiple character buffer.
.Pp
Input and output for each MultiFaceCard III line may set to a maximum baud
rates of 1152000.  Formula for baud rate:  Baud = 230400 / N with 1 < N < 65536.
.Pp
Input and output for each MultiFaceCard II line may set to a maximum baud
rates of 57600.  Formula for baud rate:  Baud = 115200 / N with 1 < N < 65536.

.It mfcs0: fifo overflow.
The four-character input
.Dq fifo
has overflowed and incoming data has been lost.
.It mfcs0: %d buffer overflows.
The software based input ring buffer
has overflowed %d times and incoming data has been lost.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Tn Amiga
.Nm
device first appeared in
.Nx 1.1
.Sh BUGS
The MultiFaceCard II/III serial ports use the level 6 interrupt and may
experience fifo overflows if the LEV6_DEFER option is used.
