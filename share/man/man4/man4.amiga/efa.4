.Sh NAME
.Nm efa
.Nd ELBOX FastATA 1200 IDE disk controller driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "efa0 at mainbus0"
.\".Cd "options EFA_32BIT_IO"
.\".Cd "options EFA_NO_INTR"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the FastATA 1200 family of IDE controllers and
provides the interface with the hardware for the
.Xr ata 4
driver.
PIO modes 0, 3, 4 and 5 are supported.
.\".Pp
.\"The following kernel configuration options are available:
.\".Bl -ohang
.\".It Cd options EFA_32BIT_IO
.\"Use 32-bit data port.
.\".It Cd options EFA_NO_INTR
.\"Disable hardware interrupt support.
.\".El
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports the following hardware:
.Bl -tag -width "ELBOX FastATA 1200 Mk-IV" -offset indent
.It Em ELBOX FastATA 1200 Mk-III
.It Em ELBOX FastATA 1200 Mk-IV
.It Em ELBOX FastATA 1200 Mk-IV CF/SATA
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ata 4 ,
.Xr wdc 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device first appeared in
.Nx 6.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Radoslaw Kujawa Aq radoslaw.kujawa@gmail.com .
.Sh CAVEATS
Older versions of FastATA 1200 are NOT supported:
.Bl -tag -width "ELBOX FastATA 1200 Mk-II" -offset indent
.It Em ELBOX FastATA 1200 Mk-I
.It Em ELBOX FastATA 1200 Lite
.It Em ELBOX FastATA 1200 GOLD
.It Em ELBOX FastATA 1200 Mk-II
.El
.Pp
These devices do not generate hardware interrupts and need to be driven in
non-standard polling mode.
Code needed to support it is present in driver but does not work correctly.
.Pp
Some of the above devices were also marketed under PowerFlyer and Winner brands.
.Pp
The onboard Gayle IDE controller can not be used when FastATA is installed and
therefore, the
.Nm
driver will not coexist with
.Xr wdc 4
driver attached to
.Xr mainbus 4 .
Both
.Nm
and
.Xr wdc 4
can be enabled in the same kernel, but only one will attach (depending on the
return value of probe function in the
.Nm
driver).
.Pp
DMA modes are not supported, this is a hardware limitation.
.Sh BUGS
Performance is worse than with official AmigaOS driver from ELBOX.
.Pp
Disks partitioned in split mode, which is specific to official AmigaOS FastATA
driver, are not recognized in
.Nx .
