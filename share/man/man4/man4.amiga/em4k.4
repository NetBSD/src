.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Radoslaw Kujawa Aq Mt radoslaw.kujawa@gmail.com .
It was developed using information obtained through reverse engineering
by
.An Frank Wille
and
.An Radoslaw Kujawa .
The authors have no access to official
documentation (which is only available under NDA).
.Sh BUGS
DMA to host memory is not supported.
It is unclear if the hardware supports DMA to host memory at all.
It is possible to implement DMA through bounce buffers in graphics card memory,
but this needs further research.
