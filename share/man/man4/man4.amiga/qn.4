.Sh NAME
.Nm qn
.Nd Ethernet driver for Fujitsu MB86950 based boards
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "qn* at zbus0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to the 10 Mb/s Ethernet network via the
.Tn Fujitsu
MB86950
Ethernet chip set.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
interface supports the following Zorro II expansion cards:
.Bl -tag -width "QuickNet" -offset indent
.It Em QuickNet
Resource Management Force's Ethernet card, manufacturer\ 2011, product\ 2
.El
.Sh NOTES
Multicasting not done yet. If the driver happens to lock up, you may use
.Xr ifconfig 8
to force the driver down and up again. This usually helps.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr amiga/intro 4 ,
.Xr arp 4 ,
.Xr inet 4 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
interface first appeared in
.Nx 1.1
