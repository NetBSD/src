.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm autoconf
.Nd diagnostics from the autoconfiguration code
.Sh DESCRIPTION
When
.Nx
bootstraps it probes the innards of the machine
on which it is running
and locates controllers, drives, and other devices, printing out
what it finds on the console.  This procedure is driven by a system
configuration table which is processed by
.Xr config 1
and compiled into each kernel.
Devices which exist in the machine but are not configured into the
kernel are not detected.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It CPU class not configured.
You tried to boot
.Nx
on a class of
.Tn CPU
type which it doesn't
(or at least this compiled version of
.Nx
doesn't) understand.
.Pp
.It %s at mainbus0.
An Amiga internal device
.Ql %s
was configured
.It not configured.
If this line follows the
.Ql fd0 at fdc0
configuration line, this diagnostic
indicates that a second floppy drive was detected, but was not configured
into the kernel.
.Pp
.It zbus0 at mainbus0 [mem 0x%x-0x%x].
The kernel is configuring AutoConfigured expansion boards.  If any Zorro
II memory was detected, the virtual address of the space reserved for
DMA bounce buffers is printed.
.Pp
.It %s at zbus0: pa 0x%x man/prod %d/%d.
A Zorro expansion board was configured.
.Ql pa 0x%0x
is the physical address the board was configured at.
.Ql Man/prod %d/%d
is the manufacturer/product codes.
.Pp
.It %s at zbus0: pa 0x%x man/prod %d/%d not configured.
A Zorro expansion board located at
.Ql pa 0x%0x
with a manufacturer/product code
.Ql %d/%d
was found that is not configured into the kernel.
