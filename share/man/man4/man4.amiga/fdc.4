.Sh NAME
.Nm fdc
.Nd Amiga custom chip floppy disk controller device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "fdc0 at mainbus0"
.Cd "fd* at fdc? unit ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver provides support for the mainboard floppy disk controller and
floppy disk drives on Amiga systems.
.Pp
The driver supports the following floppy diskette formats by using
particular partitions:
.Bl -tag -width Dv -offset indent -compact
.It "880KB " "3.5-inch " 11 sectors/track (``Amiga'') (a)
.It "1.76MB" "3.5-inch " 22 sectors/track (``Amiga'') (a)
.It "880KB " "5.25-inch" 11 sectors/track (``Amiga'') (a)
.It "720KB " "3.5-inch "  9 sectors/track (``MS-DOS'') (b)
.It "1.44MB" "3.5-inch " 18 sectors/track (``MS-DOS'') (b)
.It "720KB " "5.25-inch"  9 sectors/track (``MS-DOS'') (b)
.El
On systems equipped with floppy disk drives capable of using high-density
floppy diskettes,
the driver automatically detects whether the inserted floppy diskette is
either a double-density or a high-density medium.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "fdc: unable to allocate DMA buffer"
The driver found the controller, but was unable to allocate the
amount of chip memory required for its DMA buffers.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr fdformat 1 ,
.Xr amiga/autoconf 4
.Sh BUGS
In order to detect a floppy disk drive's capability of using high-density
media, a high-density diskette has to be inserted for the duration of the
autoconfiguration phase of the drive.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports neither the
.Xr fdformat 1
facility nor the
.In sys/fdio.h
interface.
