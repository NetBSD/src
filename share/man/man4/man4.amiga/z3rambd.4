.Sh CAVEATS
Currently it is up to the user to ensure that given memory board
is not used by the kernel as normal RAM.
It is usually safe to pass the
.Ic -n0
and
.Ic -p
parameters to boot loader.
.Pp
If the kernel is compiled without the
.Nm
driver, it is possible to use Zorro III
memory boards as normal RAM in some configurations.
However, this might have severe performance consequences.
It is advised to use Zorro III memory boards as swap where possible.
