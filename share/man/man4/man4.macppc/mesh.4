.Sh NAME
.Nm mesh
.Nd Apple Macintosh Enhanced SCSI Hardware driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "mesh* at obio? flags 0xffff"
.Cd "scsibus* at mesh?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the SCSI host adapters found on
most supported models with on-board SCSI.  The Apple Network Server models
use the
.Xr esp 4
and
.Xr esiop 4
devices for SCSI, not
.Nm .
.Pp
Models supported by
.Nm
are:
.Bl -dash -compact -offset indent
.It
Apple PowerBook (2400, 3400, G3, and G3 Series)
.It
Apple PowerBook (G3 Series (bronze keyboard))
.It
Apple Power Macintosh/Performa (4400, 54xx, 5500, 6300/160, 6360, 6400, and
6500)
.It
Apple Power Macintosh (7300, 7500, 7600, 8500, 8600, 9500, and 9600)
.It
Apple Workgroup Server 8550
.It
Apple Power Macintosh G3 (Beige G3)
.It
APS Tech (M*Power 604e/200)
.It
Motorola StarMax (3000, 4000, 5000, and 5500)
.It
Power Computing (PowerBase, PowerCenter, PowerCenter Pro, PowerCurve,
PowerTower, PowerTower Pro, and PowerWave)
.It
UMAX (Apus 2000, Apus 3000, C500, and C600)
.It
UMAX (J700, S900)
.El
.Pp
Some models have a separate SCSI bus dedicated to external devices using
the
.Xr esp 4
device.
On these systems, the
.Nm
SCSI bus is operated in SCSI
.Sq Fast
mode
.Pq "10 MB/s"
and the external
.Xr esp 4
bus is operated at 5 MB/s.  This applies only to the following models:
.Bl -dash -compact -offset indent
.It
Apple Power Macintosh (7300, 7500, 7600, 8500, 8600, 9500, and 9600)
