.Sh NAME
.Nm ncrsc
.Nd NCR 53c710 SCSI I/O Processor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ncrsc0 at pcctwo? ipl 2"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides an abstraction layer between the SCSI hardware
fitted to
.Tn Motorola
MVME167 and MVME177 single board computers (NCR73C710),
and the machine independent SCSI drivers described in
.Xr scsibus 4 .
.Pp
In addition to sending the required SCSI commands to
target devices on the SCSI bus, the
.Nm
driver deals with DMA, device interrupts, sync/async negotiation
and target disconnects/reconnects.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Too many to mention.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mvme68k/pcctwo 4 ,
.Xr scsibus 4
.Sh BUGS
The current
.Nm
driver should be obsoleted and replaced with a machine independent
version.
