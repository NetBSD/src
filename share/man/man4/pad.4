.Nm
is a pseudo-device driver which provides support for feeding back PCM data
from consumers of an

device to userland.
.Pp
The raw PCM data readable from
.Pa /dev/padN
is encoded in stereo little-endian 16-bit linear PCM at 44100 Hz.
.Sh FILES
The
.Nm
pseudo-device driver receives data from
.Pa /dev/audioN
and feeds the raw PCM output to
.Pa /dev/padN .
.Pa /dev/audioN
is created once
.Pa /dev/padN
is opened.

Record the output of an application (in this case, audioplay):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ ffmpeg -f s16le -ar 44100 -ac 2 -i /dev/pad0 output.wav
$ audioplay -d /dev/audio1 input.wav
