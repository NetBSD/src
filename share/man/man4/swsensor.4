.Sh NAME
.Nm swsensor
.Nd software environmental sensor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device swsensor"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides a software environmental sensor that works with
.Xr  sysctl 8
and
.Xr envstat 8 .
The driver creates a single sensor which is intended to be loaded as a
kernel module.
By default, the sensor is of type ENVSYS_UNITS_INTEGER.
This can be overridden when the module is loaded by passing the desired
sensor type in the property list with
.Xr modload 8 .
For example,
.Dl Ic modload -i type=1 swsensor
will create a sensor of type ENVSYS_UNITS_SFANRPM.
.Pp
The sensor's raw value can be manually updated by modifying the
.Xr sysctl 8
variable
.Dq hw.swsensor.cur_value .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr envstat 8 ,
.Xr modctl 8 ,
.Xr sysctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Paul Goyette
and first appeared in
.Nx 6.0 .
