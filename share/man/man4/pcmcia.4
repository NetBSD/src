.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver appeared in
.Nx 1.3 .
.Sh BUGS
.Ss IO space conflicts
.Nx 
probes the pcmcia IO bus width and uses that information to decide
where to map PCMCIA IO space. For 10-bit wide cards, 0x300-0x3ff is
used. For 12-bit wide cards, 0x400-0x4ff is used.
.Pp
Neither choice is perfect. In the 12-bit case, 0x400 appears to work
on substantially more devices than 0x300. In the event that pcmcia
devices are mapped in 0x400-0xfff and appear to be nonfunctional,
remapping to 0x300-0x3ff may be appropriate; consult
.Cd options PCIC_ISA_ALLOC_IOBASE
and
.Cd options PCIC_ISA_ALLOC_IOSIZE
in
.Xr options 4 .
Example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# Avoid pcmcia bus space conflicts with the default io space
# allocation on 12-bit wide busses (base 0x400 size 0xfff).
options PCIC_ISA_ALLOC_IOBASE=0x300
options PCIC_ISA_ALLOC_IOSIZE=0x0ff
