.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver appeared in
.Nx 1.3 .
.Sh BUGS
.Ss IO space conflicts
.Nx
probes the
.Tn PCMCIA
IO bus width and uses that information to decide
where to map
.Tn PCMCIA
IO space.
For 10-bit wide cards, 0x300-0x3ff is used.
For 12-bit wide cards, 0x400-0x4ff is used.
.Pp
Neither choice is perfect.
In the 12-bit case, 0x400 appears to work
in substantially more devices than 0x300.
In the event that
.Tn PCMCIA
devices are mapped in 0x400-0x4ff and appear to be nonfunctional,
remapping to 0x300-0x3ff may be appropriate; consult
.Cd options PCIC_ISA_ALLOC_IOBASE
and
.Cd options PCIC_ISA_ALLOC_IOSIZE
in
.Xr options 4 .
Example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# Avoid PCMCIA bus space conflicts with the default IO space
# allocation on 12-bit wide busses (base 0x300 size 0xff).
options PCIC_ISA_ALLOC_IOBASE=0x300
options PCIC_ISA_ALLOC_IOSIZE=0x0ff
.Ed
.Ss Interrupt conflicts
.Nx
attempts to probe for available interrupts to assign to
.Tn PCMCIA
devices.
In some cases, it is not possible to detect
all interrupts in use; in such cases, use of
.Cd options PCIC_ISA_INTR_ALLOC_MASK
may be necessary.
See
.Xr options 4 .
.Ss Unconfigured devices
During autoconfiguration, if a message is displayed saying that your card
is "not configured" it indicates that there isn't support for your card
compiled into the kernel.
To fix this problem, it may simply be a matter
of adding the manufacturer and product IDs to the
.Tn PCMCIA
database or adding a front-end attachment to an existing driver.
In the latter case, it is normally always necessary to get a dump
of the CIS table from the card.
You can do this by adding
.Cd options PCMCIACISDEBUG
and
.Cd options PCMCIADEBUG
into your kernel config file.
Additionally, you will have to patch the kernel to enable run-time
debugging.
This can be done in the source by changing the variables
.Va pcmcia_debug
and
.Va pcmciacis_debug
to 0xff.
Alternatively, you can patch the same variables at run-time using
.Xr ddb 4 .
For most drivers you should also consider enabling any driver-specific
debugging options.
