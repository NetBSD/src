.Dt KCOV 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm kcov
.Nd kernel code coverage tracing
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd options KCOV
.Pp
.In sys/kcov.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver implements collection of code coverage inside the kernel.
It can be enabled on a per thread basis from userland,
allowing the kernel program counter to be collected during syscalls triggered by
the same thread.
.Pp
The
.Nm
descriptors (KD) are allocated during
.Xr open 2 ,
and are associated with a file descriptor.
A thread can enable the
.Nm
device.
When this happens,
this thread becomes the owner of the
.Nm
descriptors (KD),
and no thread can disable this KD except the owner.
.Pp
A
.Nm
descriptor (KD)
is freed when its file descriptor is closed iff the KD is not active on a thread.
If it is,
we ask the thread to free it when it exits.
.Pp
The collected coverage can be accessed by mapping the device
using
.Xr mmap 2 .
The buffers are mapped without risk that the kernel frees a buffer still mapped in a process.
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
is not enabled but requires the compile-time configuration
.Cd makeoptions KCOV
.Cd options KCOV
to be present,
see
.Xr options 4 .
.Pp
The following
.Xr ioctl 2
calls are provided:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Dv KCOV_IOC_SETBUFSIZE Fa uint64_t *nentries
Allocate a coverage buffer with a capacity of
.Fa nentries .
The buffer can be accessed using
.Xr mmap 2
whereas the returned pointer must be interpreted as an array of
.Vt kcov_int_t
entries.
Note that kcov_int_t is volatile.
The first entry contains the number of entries in the array,
excluding the first entry.
.It Dv KCOV_IOC_ENABLE Fa void
Enable code coverage tracing for the current thread.
.It Dv KCOV_IOC_DISABLE Fa void
Disable code coverage tracing for the current thread.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/kcov -compact
.It Pa /dev/kcov
Default device node.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
In the following example,
the
.Xr read 2
syscall is traced and the coverage displayed, which in turn can be passed to
.Xr addr2line 1
in order to translate the kernel program counter into the file name and line
number it corresponds to.
