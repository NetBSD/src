.Sh NAME
.Nm urtwn
.Nd Realtek RTL8188CU/RTL8192CU USB IEEE 802.11b/g/n wireless network device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "urtwn* at uhub? port ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports USB 2.0 wireless network devices based on Realtek
RTL8188CUS, RTL8188CE-VAU, RTL8188RU, and RTL8192CU chipsets.
.Pp
The RTL8188CUS is a highly integrated 802.11n adapter that combines
a MAC, a 1T1R capable baseband and an RF in a single chip.
It operates in the 2GHz spectrum only.
The RTL8188RU is a high-power variant of the RTL8188CUS.
The RTL8188CE-VAU is a PCI Express Mini Card adapter that attaches
to the USB interface.
.Pp
The RTL8192CU is a highly integrated multiple-in, multiple-out (MIMO)
802.11n adapter that combines a MAC, a 2T2R capable baseband and an
RF in a single chip.
It operates in the 2GHz spectrum only.
.Pp
These are the modes the
.Nm
driver can operate in:
.Bl -tag -width "IBSS-masterXX"
.It BSS mode
Also known as
.Em infrastructure
mode, this is used when associating with an access point, through
which all traffic passes.
This mode is the default.
.It monitor mode
In this mode the driver is able to receive packets without
associating with an access point.
This disables the internal receive filter and enables the card to
capture packets from networks which it wouldn't normally have access to,
or to scan for access points.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured to use
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) or
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK).
WPA is the de facto encryption standard for wireless networks.
It is strongly recommended that WEP
not be used as the sole mechanism
to secure wireless communication,
due to serious weaknesses in it.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured at runtime with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or on boot with
.Xr ifconfig.if 5 .
.Sh FILES
The driver needs at least version 1.1p0 of the following firmware files,
which are loaded when an interface is attached:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It /libdata/firmware/urtwn/urtwn-rtl8192cfwT
.It /libdata/firmware/urtwn/urtwn-rtl8192cfwU
.It /libdata/firmware/urtwn/urtwn-rtl8723fw
.El
.Pp
A prepackaged version of the firmware, designed to be used with
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
can be found at:
.Bd -literal -offset 3n
http://firmware.openbsd.org/firmware/urtwn-firmware-1.1p0.tgz
.Ed
.Sh HARDWARE
The following adapters should work:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Airlink101 AWLL5088
.It Aus. Linx AL-9604R1S
.It B-Link BL-LW05-5R
.It Belkin F7D1102 Surf Wireless Micro
.It D-Link DWA-121
.It D-Link DWA-133
.It D-Link DWA-135
.It Digitus DN-7042
.It Edimax EW-7811Un
.It EDUP EP-N8508
.It Full River FR-W100NUL
.It Hercules Wireless N USB Pico HWNUp-150
.It Netgear WNA1000A
.It Planex GW-USEco300
.It Planex GW-USNano2
.It Planex GW-USValue-EZ
.It Planex GW-USWExtreme
.It POWCHIP POW-N18
.It Sitecom WL-365
.It Solwise NET-WL-UMD-606N
.It TRENDnet TEW-648UBM
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following
.Xr ifconfig.if 5
example configures urtwn0 to join whatever network is available on boot,
using WEP key
.Dq 0x1deadbeef1 ,
channel 11, obtaining an IP address using DHCP:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
nwkey 0x1deadbeef1 chan 11
dhcp
.Ed
.Pp
Configure urtwn0 to join network
.Dq my_net
using WPA with passphrase
.Dq my_passphrase :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig urtwn0 nwid my_net wpakey my_passphrase
.Ed
.Pp
Join an existing BSS network,
.Dq my_net :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig urtwn0 192.168.1.1 netmask 0xffffff00 nwid my_net
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "urtwn%d: error %d, could not read firmware %s"
For some reason, the driver was unable to read the microcode file from the
filesystem.
The file might be missing or corrupted.
.It "urtwn%d: device timeout"
A frame dispatched to the hardware for transmission did not complete in time.
The driver will reset the hardware.
This should not happen.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.9
and in
.Nx 7.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Damien Bergamini
.Aq damien@openbsd.org
for
.Ox
and ported to
.Nx
by
.An NONAKA Kimihiro
.Aq nonaka@NetBSD.org .
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
driver does not support any of the 802.11n capabilities offered by the
adapters.
Additional work is required in
.Xr ieee80211 9
before those features can be supported.
