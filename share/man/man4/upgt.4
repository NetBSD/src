.Sh NAME
.Nm upgt
.Nd Conexant/Intersil PrismGT SoftMAC USB IEEE 802.11b/g wireless network device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "upgt* at uhub? port ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the USB 2.0 Conexant/Intersil PrismGT series wireless
adapters based on the GW3887 chipset.
.Pp
These are the modes the
.Nm
driver can operate in:
.Bl -tag -width "IBSS-masterXX"
.It BSS mode
Also known as
.Em infrastructure
mode, this is used when associating with an access point, through
which all traffic passes.
This mode is the default.
.\" .It IBSS mode
.\" Also known as
.\" .Em IEEE ad-hoc
.\" mode or
.\" .Em peer-to-peer
.\" mode.
.\" This is the standardized method of operating without an access point.
.\" Stations associate with a service set.
.\" However, actual connections between stations are peer-to-peer.
.\" .It Host AP
.\" In this mode the driver acts as an access point (base station)
.\" for other cards.
.It monitor mode
In this mode the driver is able to receive packets without
associating with an access point.
This disables the internal receive filter and enables the card to
capture packets from networks which it wouldn't normally have access to,
or to scan for access points.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured to use
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) or
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK).
WPA is the de facto encryption standard for wireless networks.
It is strongly recommended that WEP
not be used as the sole mechanism
to secure wireless communication,
due to serious weaknesses in it.
The
.Nm
driver relies on the software 802.11 stack for both encryption and decryption
of data frames.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured at runtime with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or on boot with
.Xr ifconfig.if 5 .
.Sh FILES
The driver needs a firmware file which is loaded when an interface is
brought up:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Pa /libdata/firmware/upgt/upgt-gw3887
.El
.Pp
Currently these firmware files can not be included in
.Nx
base system.
Please download these files and put them into
the above firmware directory.
.Pp
A tar archive file that includes
.Pa upgt-gw3887
firmware can be found at:

.Sh EXAMPLES
The following
.Xr ifconfig.if 5
example configures upgt0 to join whatever network is available on boot,
using WEP key
.Dq 0x1deadbeef1 ,
channel 11, obtaining an IP address using
.Xr dhcpcd 8 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ssid 'my network' nwkey 0x1deadbeef1 chan 11
dhcp

.\"The following

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.3 .
It was ported to
.Nx
by FUKAUMI Naoki and first appeared in
.Nx 6.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Marcus Glocker Aq mglocker@openbsd.org .
.Pp
The hardware specification was reverse engineered by the people at
.Lk http://lekernel.net/prism54/ .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver just supports the USB 2.0 devices (GW3887 chipset) but not the
USB 1.0 devices containing the NET2280, ISL3880, and ISL3886 chipsets.
Some further efforts would be necessary to add USB 1.0 support to the
driver.
