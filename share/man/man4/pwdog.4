.Sh NAME
.Nm pwdog
.Nd Quancom PWDOG1 watchdog timer device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pwdog0 at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Quancom PWDOG1 boards.
.Pp
If the kernel crashes, the watchdog timer is not reset and the system will
reboot (assuming a proper connection is made between the PWDOG1 and
the motherboard).
Alternatively, the watchdog can be reinitialized via a userland process which
ensures that process scheduling, not just kernel timeout processing, is still
taking place.
.Pp
The timeout period of the PWDOG1 card is set using DIP switches and cannot
be changed by software.

and
