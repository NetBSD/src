.Sh NAME
.Nm sii
.Nd
SII SCSI adaptor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "sii* at ibus0 addr ?"
.Cd "scsibus* at sii?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the
.Tn DEC
SII SCSI adaptor ASIC used in
the DECstation 2100, 3100, and 5100.
.Pp
The
.Nm
is a medium-performance implementation of the SCSI-I common command set
supporting synchronous and asynchronous SCSI devices.
.Pp
The SII cabling is unusual: the bulkhead connector is very similar
to a standard submicro wide SCSI-II connector, but has the other gender.
.Pp
The
.Nm
chip only supports DMA to or from a fixed window in memory.
The driver uses this "window" area as a bounce buffer, copying data
to and from the DMA region.

driver first appeared in
