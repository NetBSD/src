.Sh NAME
.Nm le
.Nd
DECstation AMD 7990 LANCE ethernet interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "le? at mainbus	with le_pmax"		(3100 baseboard)
.Cd "le*? at tc	with le_tc"		(5000/200 baseboard)
.Cd "le? at ioasic  with le_ioasic"	(ioasic baseboard)
.Cd "le* at tc?	with le_tc"		(TC option cards)
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides access to a 10Mb/s Ethernet via the
.Tn AMD
7990
.Tn LANCE
Ethernet chip.
All
.Tn LANCE
interfaces on
.Tn DECstations
are supported, as are interfaces on
.Tn "Alpha AXP"
machines with a
.Tn TurboChannel
bus.
.Pp
The
.Nm 
driver employs the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) described in
.Xr arp 4
to map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local network.
.Pp
Selective reception of multicast Ethernet frames is provided
by a 64-bit mask; multicast destination addresses are hashed to a
bit entry using the Ethernet CRC function.
.Pp
No support is provided for switching between media ports.
The
.Tn DECstation
3100 provides both AUI and BNC (thinwire or 10base2) connectors.
Port selection is via a manual switch and is not software configurable.
.Pp
The
.Tn DECstation
model 5000/200
.Tn PMAD-AA
baseboard device provides only a BNC connector.
.Pp
The
.Nm ioasic
baseboard devices and the 
.Tn PMAD-AA
.Tn TurboChannel
option card provide only an AUI port.

.Sh BUGS
On all front-ends, performance is impaired by hardware which
forces a software copy of packets to and from DMA buffers.
The
.Nm ioasic
machines and the
.Tn DECstation
3100 must 
copy packets to and from non-contiguous DMA buffers.
The 
.Tn DECstation
5000/200 and the
.Tn PMAD-AA 
must copy to and from an onboard SRAM DMA buffer.
The CPU overhead is noticeable, but all machines
can sustain full 10 Mb/s media speed.
.Sh HISTORY
This
.Nm
driver is derived from a
.Nm
driver that first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
Support for multiple bus attachments first appeared in
.Nx 1.2 .
