.Sh NAME
.Nm ibus
.Nd pmax internal I/O space driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ibus0 at mainbus0"
.Cd "ibus0 at tc? slot ? offset ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a virtual device corresponding to the pmax internal I/O space found
on DEC 2100, 3100, 5100 and 5000/200 systems.
.Pp
Internal I/O space spans the pmax physical address space, and is
mapped permanently in the kernel virtual space at the very early time
of the kernel startup procedure.
.Pp
.Nm
driver manages the internal I/O space of pmax.

.It
Address range management to avoid confliction of address space of
which devices probe by touching hardware port is difficult.
.It
Interrupt vector management.
