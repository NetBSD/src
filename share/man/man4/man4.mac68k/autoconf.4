.Sh NAME
.Nm autoconf
.Nd diagnostics from the autoconfiguration code
.Sh DESCRIPTION
When
.Nx
bootstraps it probes the innards of the machine
on which it is running
and locates controllers, drives, and other devices, printing out
what it finds on the console.  This procedure is driven by a system
configuration table which is processed by
.Xr config 1
and compiled into each kernel.
Devices which exist in the machine but are not configured into the
kernel are usually not detected.
The exception to this is the case of
.Tn NuBus
expansion boards.
All
.Tn NuBus
slots are probed,
and information about any cards found is reported even if the card
is not currently configured.
