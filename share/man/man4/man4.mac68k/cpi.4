.Sh NAME
.Nm cpi
.Nd parallel printer driver for Creative Systems Inc. Hurdler CPI Nubus card
.\"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "cpi* at nubus? flags 0x1"
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to parallel printer ports.
.\"
.Sh CONFIGURATION
The
.Nm
driver supports the following
.Sy flags
for use in
.Xr config 1
files:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width "bits 16-23:"
.It bit 0 :
use the CIO counters 1 and 2 as a 32 bit
.Xr timecounter 9 .
.El
.\"
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
interface supports the Creative Systems Inc. Hurdler CPI Nubus card,
which is based on a Zilog Z8536 CIO.
.\"
.Pp
The parallel port on the Hurdler CPI card is wired as follows:
.Bl -column "/STROBE" "Page error" "SubD pin" "Z8536 pin" "Z8536 signal"
.It Sy "Signal"		SubD pin	Z8536 pin	Z8536 signal
.It /STROBE	Strobe	1	22	PC3
.It D0		2	33	PA0
.It \&D1		3	32	PA1
.It D2		4	31	PA2
.It D3		5	30	PA3
.It D4		6	29	PA4
.It D5		7	28	PA5
.It D6		8	27	PA6
.It D7		9	26	PA7
.It /ACK		10	21 + 11	PC2 + PB3
.It BUSY		11	19 + 14	PC0 + PB6
.It PE	Paper Error	12	20	PC1
.It SEL	Select	13	13	PB5
.It /AUTOFD	Auto Feed	14	12	PB4
.It /FAULT		15	9	PB1
.It /RESET		16	8	PB0
.It /SELIN	Select \&In	17	10	PB2
.El
.Pp
The Z8536 INT line (pin 24) is wired to PB7 (pin 15).

.Sh CAVEATS
The Hurdler CPI Nubus card does not use a TTL buffer to
drive the parallel interface.
Instead, the card's Z8536 CIO drives the printer port directly.
Printers terminating the parallel interface with less
than 2 kOhms may cause permanent damage to the Z8536 CIO.
