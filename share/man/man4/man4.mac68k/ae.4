.Sh NAME
.Nm ae
.Nd Ethernet driver for DP8390-based NuBus Ethernet boards
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ae* at nubus?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Ethernet network via the
National Semiconductor DP8390 Ethernet chip set.  This set includes
the DP83902.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the
local network.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
interface is currently known to support the following NuBus cards:
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.Bl -item -compact
.It
Asante MacCon Series
.It
Asante MacCon-i Series
.It
Asante MacCON-III+ PDS card
.It
Farallon EtherMac Series
.It
Farallon EtherWave Series
.It
Apple EtherTalk NB
.It
3Com EtherLink NB
.El
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag -compact
.It ae%d at nubus%d: address %s, type %s  %dKB memory.
This is a normal autoconfiguration message noting the 6 byte physical
Ethernet address of the adapter, its manufacturer, and how much buffer
memory it has.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
interface first appeared in
.Nx 1.0 .
