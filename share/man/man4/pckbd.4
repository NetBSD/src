.Sh NAME
.Nm pckbd
.Nd PC keyboard driver for wscons
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd pckbc* at isa?
.Cd pckbd* at pckbc?
.Cd "wskbd* at pckbd? console ?"
.Cd options PCKBD_LAYOUT=XXX
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver supports PC/AT keyboards within the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
It doesn't provide direct device driver entry points but makes its
functions available via the internal
.Xr wskbd 4
interface.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports a number of different key mappings which
can be chosen from with the kernel option
.Li PCKBD_LAYOUT
at compile time or with the utility
.Xr wsconsctl 8
(variable:
.Dq encoding )
at runtime.
Other mappings can be used if the whole keymap is replaced by means of
.Xr wsconsctl 8 .
.Pp
Because PC keyboard hardware doesn't contain a beeper, requests for
.Dq keyboard beeps
cannot be handled directly.
On alpha and i386 a helper device attached
to the
.Xr pcppi 4
driver allows the use of the standard ISA speaker for this purpose.
On acorn32,
.Xr vidcaudio 4
performs this function.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To set a German keyboard layout without
.Dq dead accents
and sending an ESC character before the key symbol if the ALT
key is pressed simultaneously, use
.Ic wsconsctl Fl w Ar encoding=de.nodead.metaesc .
To set it at kernel build time, add
.D1 Cd options PCKBD_LAYOUT="(KB_DE | KB_NODEAD | KB_METAESC)"
to the kernel configuration file.
