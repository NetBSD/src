.Sh NAME
.Nm bt3c
.Nd 3Com Bluetooth PC Card driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "bt3c* at pcmcia? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the 3Com Bluetooth PC Card, model 3CRWB6096, to
the Bluetooth protocol stack.
.Sh FIRMWARE
This card needs firmware loaded before it will work. Due to copyright restrictions
we cannot distribute the firmware with NetBSD, but if you have the card then you
should have received a CD with the drivers on, or you may download the latest
version from the 3Com website. Create a directory named
.Nm
in the search path of the
.Xr firmload 9
kernel subsystem. Now, extract the driver archive and find the firmware file
called
.Nm "BT3CPCC.bin" ,
and place this file in the newly created directory. The firmware will be loaded
automatically as needed.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -tag -width XXX -compact
.It "bt3c%d: Cannot open firmware"
This will be printed to the console if the device cannot open the firmware file
as described above.
.Pp
.It "bt3c%d: Antenna In"
.It "bt3c%d: Antenna Out"
If the kernel is compiled with the
.Dv DIAGNOSTIC
option, these messages will be produced on the console when the card antenna
position is changed.
.Pp
.It "bt3c%d: sleeping"
.It "bt3c%d: waking up"
These messages will be produced when the card is enabled or disabled due to
power change events.
