.Sh NAME
.Nm ms
.Nd Sun workstation mouse driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device mouse"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides an interface to the workstation console mouse.
This
.Tn Mouse Systems
three-button device produces five-byte blobs of the form:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
b dx dy dx dy
.Ed
.Pp
where
.Dq b
is the button state, encoded as
.Li 0x80|(~buttons)
-- there are three buttons (4=left, 2=middle, 1=right) --
and
.Dq \&dx
and
.Dq \&dy
are X and Y delta values, none of which are in the range
.Bq Li 0x80..0x87 .
.Pp
The device special file
.Pa /dev/mouse
is used to get direct access to the mouse input stream.
The following
ioctl's are supported (mostly just enough to keep the
.Ic X
server going):
.Bl -tag -width VUIDSFORMAT
.It Dv VUIDSFORMAT
Set translation mode.
The argument is of type
.Fa "int *" ,
the only value supported is
.Dv VUID_FIRM_EVENT .
.It Dv VUIDGFORMAT
Get translation mode.
The argument is of type
.Fa "int *" .
.Dv VUID_FIRM_EVENT
is always returned.
.El
.Ss OPTIONS
The mouse driver can be configured using the following kernel configuration
file options.
.Bl -tag -width VUIDSFORMAT
.It Cd options SUN_MS_BPS=integer
This option causes the kernel to communicate with the mouse using the serial
baud rate
.Va integer .
It is useful for mice which do not communicate at 1200 baud.
