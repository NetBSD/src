.Sh NAME
.Nm kbd
.Nd Sun workstation keyboard
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device kbd"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides an interface to the workstation console keyboard.
.Qq type 2 ,
.Qq type 3 ,
.Qq type 4 ,
and
.Qq type 5
keyboards are supported.
The
.Qq type 5
keyboard is treated as if it were a
.Qq type 4 .
All types generate keycodes encoding the
key identity and motion (up or down) as the keys are pressed and released.
The
.Nm
driver either passes the keycodes to an application as they come in, or
translates them into
.Tn ASCII
characters first according to a set of built-in tables.
.Pp
If the keyboard is configured as the device
to be used for system console input
.Pq see Xr eeprom 8 ,
it will be internally connected to the
.Pa /dev/console
device special file, which can be used as a
.Xr tty 4
device.
.Pp
The device special file
.Pa /dev/kbd
is used to get direct access to the keyboard input stream.
The following
ioctl's are supported (mostly just enough to keep the
.Ic X
server going):
.Bl -tag -width KIOCSDIRECT
.It KIOCTRANS
Set translation mode.
The argument is of type
.Fa "int *" ,
the only value supported is
.Dv TR_UNTRANS_EVENT .
.It KIOCGTRANS
Get translation mode.
The argument is of type
.Fa "int *" .
.Dv TR_UNTRANS_EVENT
is always returned.
.It KIOCGETKEY
Fill in old-style key station translation.
The argument is of type
.Fa "struct okiockey *" .
.It KIOCCMD
Send a command to the keyboard.
The argument is of type
.Fa "int *" ,
and can have one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width KBD_CMD_NOCLICK
.It KBD_CMD_BELL
Start the keyboard beeper.
.It KBD_CMD_NOBELL
Stop the keyboard beeper.
.It KBD_CMD_CLICK
Instruct the keyboard to make extra noise when touching keys.
.It KBD_CMD_NOCLICK
Instruct the keyboard to stop making extra noise when touching keys.
.El
.It KIOCTYPE
Get keyboard type.
The argument is of type
.Fa "int *" ,
in which one of the values
.Dv KB_SUN2 ,
.Dv KB_SUN3
or
.Dv KB_SUN4
will be returned.
.It KIOCSDIRECT
Route the keyboard input stream through the
.Tn SunOS
compatible event module.
The argument is of type
.Fa "int *" ,
a non-zero value will put the driver into
.Dq event
mode, while a value of zero will make it return to
.Dq ASCII translation
mode.
.It KIOCSKEY
Set key station translation.
The argument is of type
.Fa "struct kiockey *"
.Pq see Pa /usr/include/machine/kbio.h No for more details .
.It KIOCGKEY
Get key station translation.
The argument is of type
.Fa "struct kiockey *" .
.It KIOCLAYOUT
Get keyboard layout
.Pq Do type 4 Dc only .
The argument is of type
.Fa "int *" ,
in which the uninterpreted result of the
.Dv KBD_CMD_GLAYOUT
keyboard command is returned
.Po on Dv KBDUN4
type keyboards this will be the setting of a DIP switch bank
.Pc .
.It KIOCSLED
Set LED state
.Pq Do type 4 Dc only .
The argument is of type
.Fa "char *" ,
and is the inclusive OR of the following flags:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width LED_SCROLL_LOCK -compact
.It LED_NUM_LOCK
.It LED_COMPOSE
.It LED_SCROLL_LOCK
.It LED_CAPS_LOCK
.El
.Pp
Each of these flags turn on the LED in the obvious key.
.It KIOCGLED
Get LED state
.Pq Do type 4 Dc only .
The argument is of type
.Fa "char *" ,
in which the current LED state is returned.
