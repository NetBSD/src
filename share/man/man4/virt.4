.Sh NAME
.Nm virt
.Nd rump kernel virtual network interface
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface acts as a link between a rump kernel and a host
.Xr tap 4
interface.
Interface number <n> always corresponds with the host tap interface tap<n>.
All data sent by
.Nm
is written into
.Pa /dev/tap<n>
and all data read from
.Pa /dev/tap<n>
is passed as Ethernet input to the rump kernel.
.Pp
A
.Nm
interface can be created and destroyed in the normal fashion with
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
The host's
.Xr tap 4
interface can be further bridged with hardware interfaces to provide
full Internet access to a rump kernel.
