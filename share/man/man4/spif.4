.Sh NAME
.Nm spif
.Nd SBus (spiffy) Serial/Parallel Interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "spif* at sbus? slot ? offset ?                " Pq "sun4c/sun4m/sun4u"
.Cd "stty* at spif?                                " Pq "sun4c/sun4m/sun4u"
.Cd "sbpp* at spif?                                " Pq "sun4c/sun4m/sun4u"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm spif
driver provides support for the Sun Serial/Parallel Interface card
(Sun part number 501-1931), which is based on the
Cirrus Logic CD180 octal serial controller
and the Cirrus Logic PPC2 parallel port controller.
.Pp
The device minor numbers for this driver are encoded as follows:
.Bd -literal

      |   |   |   |   |   +---+---+---> port number
      |   |   |   |   |
      |   |   |   |   +---------------> unused

      |   |
      +---+---------------------------> card number
.Ed
.Pp
Up to four cards are supported in the system.
.Pp
Each of the serial ports has an 8 byte FIFO for receive and transmit as
well as automatic hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "spif%d: ccr timeout"
A timeout occurred while writing to one of the CD180 registers.
.It "stty%d-%d: ring overflow"
Incoming characters were discarded because the application
in control of the device did not read the input fast enough.
