.Sh NAME
.Nm mk48txx
.Nd
.Tn Mostek time-of-day clock driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include \*[Lt]dev/ic/mk48txxreg.h\*[Gt]
.Cd "define mk48txx"
.Cd "file   dev/ic/mk48txx.c    mk48txx"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides access to several models of
.Tn Mostek
time-of-day clock chips. Access methods to retrieve and set date and time
are provided through the
.Em TODR
interface defined in
.Xr todr 9 .
.Pp
To tie in instance of this device to the system, use
.Bd -literal
typedef uint8_t (*mk48txx_nvrd_t)(bus_space_tag_t bus_tag,
    bus_space_handle_t bus_handle, int off);
typedef void (*mk48txx_nvwr_t)(bus_space_tag_t bus_tag,
    bus_space_handle_t bus_handle, int off, uint8_t datum);
.Ed
.nr nS 1
.Ft "todr_chip_handle_t"
.Fn mk48txx_attach "bus_space_tag_t bus_tag" "bus_space_handle_t bus_handle" \
"const char *model" "int year0" \
"mk48txx_nvrd_t nvread" "mk48txx_nvwr_t nvwrite"
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Dv -offset indent
.It Fa bus_tag
.It Fa bus_handle
Specify bus space access to the chip's non-volatile memory
.Pq including the clock registers .
.It Fa model
The chip model which this instance should serve. Must be one of
.Dq mk48t02 ,
.Dq mk48t08 ,
.Dq mk48t18
or
.Dq mk48t59 .
.It Fa year0
The actual year represented by the clock's
.Sq year
counter. This is generally dependent on the system configuration in which
the clock device is mounted. For instance, on Sun Microsystems machines
the convention is to have clock's two-digit year represent the year 1968.
.It Fa nvread
.It Fa nvwrite
Specify alternate access methods for reading resp. writing clock
device registers.  The default, when
.Dv NULL
is passed as an access method, is to access the chip memory
.Pq and clock registers
as if they were direct-mapped with using the specified bus space.
.Pp
Otherwise, the driver will call the respective function to perform the
access, passing it the specified bus space and the offset
.Va off
of the chip memory
.Pq or clock register
location to be read from or written to, respectively.
.El
.Pp
Note that if the resulting date retrieved with the todr_gettime() method
is earlier that January 1, 1970, the driver will assume that the chip's
year counter actually represents a year in the 21st century. This
behaviour can be overridden by setting the global variable
.Va mk48txx_auto_century_adjust
to zero.
.Sh HARDWARE
The following models are supported:
