.Sh NAME
.Nm fujbp ,
.Nm fujhk
.Nd Fujitsu Brightness, Pointer, and Hotkeys
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "fujbp* at acpi?"
.Cd "fujhk* at acpi?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Some Fujitsu laptops come with vendor-specific
.Tn ACPI
devices to manage the laptop hotkeys (such as the
.Sq Eco
button), and to control various built-in components (such as the display,
the touchpad, and the speakers).
The
.Nm
and
.Ic fujhk
drivers provide support, through these
.Tn ACPI
devices, for hotkeys, backlight on/off switch, brightness level control, and
pointer on/off switch.
.Pp
The following
.Xr sysctl 8
read/write variables are provided (when hardware support is available):
.Bl -tag -width hw.acpi.fujbp0.brightness -offset indent
.It Va hw.acpi.fujbp0.brightness
Brightness level (integer).
.It Va hw.acpi.fujbp0.pointer
Pointer switch state (boolean).
.It Va hw.acpi.fujhk0.backlight
Backlight switch state (boolean).
.El
.Pp
Please note, however, that future versions of the drivers may remove these
.Xr sysctl 8
variables without prior notice.

.Xr acpivga 4 ,

.Xr sysmon_pswitch 9
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
and
.Ic fujhk
drivers appeared in
.Nx 6.0 .

.Sh CAVEATS
Brightness level and backlight switch state should be controlled via
.Xr wsconsctl 8
instead of
.Xr sysctl 8 .
.Pp
The
.Xr sysctl 8
variable
.Va hw.acpi.fujbp0.pointer
should be replaced by a platform-independent userland control.
