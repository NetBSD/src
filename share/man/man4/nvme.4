.Sh NAME
.Nm nvme
.Nd Non-Volatile Memory Host Controller Interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "nvme* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for NVMe, or NVM Express,
storage controllers conforming to the
Non-Volatile Memory Host Controller Interface specification.
Controllers complying to specification version 1.1 and 1.2 are known to work.
Other versions should work too for normal operation with the exception of some
pass-through commands.
.Pp
The driver supports the following features:
.Bl -bullet -compact -offset indent
.It
controller and namespace configuration and management using
.Xr nvmectl 8
.It
highly parallel I/O using per-CPU I/O queues
.It
PCI MSI/MSI-X attachment, and INTx for legacy systems
.El
.Pp
On systems supporting MSI/MSI-X, the
.Nm
driver uses per-CPU IO queue pairs for lockless and highly parallelized I/O.
Interrupt handlers are scheduled on distinct CPUs.
The driver allocates as many interrupt vectors as available, up to number
of CPUs + 1.
MSI supports up to 32 interrupt vectors within the system,
MSI-X can have up to 2k.
Each I/O queue pair has a separate command circular buffer.
The
.Nm
specification allows up to 64k commands per queue, the driver currently
allocates 1024 entries per queue, or controller maximum, whatever is smaller.
Command submissions are done always on the current CPU, the command completion
interrupt is handled on the CPU corresponding to the I/O queue ID
- first I/O queue on CPU0, second I/O queue on CPU1, etc.
Admin queue command completion is handled by CPU0 by default.
To keep lock contention to minimum, it is recommended to keep this assignment,
even though it is possible to reassign the interrupt handlers differently
using
.Xr intrctl 8 .
.Pp
On systems without MSI, the driver uses a single HW interrupt handler for
both admin and standard I/O commands.
Command submissions are done on the current CPU, the command completion
interrupt is handled on CPU0 by default.
This leads to some lock contention, especially on command ccbs.
.Pp
The driver offloads command completion processing to soft interrupt,
in order to increase the total system I/O capacity and throughput.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 6.0
and in
.Nx 8.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An David Gwynne
.Aq Mt dlg@openbsd.org
for
.Ox
and ported to
.Nx
by
.An NONAKA Kimihiro
.Aq Mt nonaka@NetBSD.org .
.An Jaromir Dolecek
.Aq Mt jdolecek@NetBSD.org
contributed to making this driver MPSAFE.
.Sh NOTES
At least some
.Tn Intel
.Nm
adapter cards are known to require
.Tn PCIe
Generation 3 slot.
Such cards do not even probe when plugged
into older generation slot.
.Pp
The driver also attaches and works fine for emulated
.Nm
devices under QEMU and
.Tn Oracle
.Tn VirtualBox .
However, there seems to be some broken interaction between
.Tn VirtualBox
5.1.6
and the driver, the emulated
.Nm
controller responds to commands only the first time it is attached,
after reboot or module reload it stops responding.
The virtual machine must be completely powered off
(or even killed) to fix this.
