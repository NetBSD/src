.Sh NAME
.Nm systrace
.Nd enforce and generate policies for system calls
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "options SYSTRACE"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
kernel facility provides a mechanism to manipulate and enforce access
policies for system calls.  Using the
.Nm
facility it is possible to monitor and control a process's access to
the kernel through system calls.
.Pp
Access to the
.Nm
facility is provided to userland processes, such as
.Xr systrace 1 ,
through an
.Xr ioctl 2
interface on the pseudo-device
.Pa /dev/systrace .
This interface allows messages to be sent from the kernel to the
userland process to request confirmation of an access policy.
.Pp
The
.Nm
facility can assign the following policies to system calls for a
specific process:
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width "XXXXXX"
.It SYSTR_POLICY_ASK
Send a message on
.Pa /dev/systrace
requesting the access policy for the system call.
.It SYSTR_POLICY_PERMIT
Immediately allow the system call.
.It SYSTR_POLICY_NEVER
Immediately deny the system call and return an error code.
.El
.Sh SYSTRACE MESSAGES
A
.Xr read 2
operation on the
.Nm
pseudo-device will block if there are no pending messages, or
return the following structure:
.Bd -literal
struct str_message {
	int32_t msg_type;
#define SYSTR_MSG_ASK	1
#define SYSTR_MSG_RES	2
#define SYSTR_MSG_EMUL	3
#define SYSTR_MSG_CHILD	4
	pid_t msg_pid;
	int16_t msg_policy;
	union {
		struct str_msg_emul msg_emul;
		struct str_msg_ask msg_ask;
		struct str_msg_child msg_child;
	} msg_data;
};

struct str_msg_emul {
	char emul[SYSTR_EMULEN];
};

struct str_msg_ask {
	int32_t code;
	int32_t argsize;
	register_t args[SYSTR_MAXARGS];
	register_t rval[2];
	int32_t result;
};

struct str_msg_child {
	pid_t new_pid;
};
.Ed
.Sh IOCTL INTERFACE
The
.Nm
facility supports the following
.Xr ioctl 2
operations:
.Bl -tag -width "XXXXXX"
.It Dv SYSTR_CLONE Fa "int"
Return a
.Nm
file descriptor for
further
.Xr ioctl 2
operations.
.It Dv STRIOCATTACH Fa "pid_t"
Attach to the process with the specified process ID.  This operation
will fail under the following conditions:
.Pp
.Bl -enum -offset indent -compact -width 2n
.It
The process is trying to attach to itself.
.It
The process is a system process.
.It
The process is being traced already.
.It
You do not own the process and you are not root.
.It
The process is
.Xr init 8 ,
and the
kernel was not compiled with
.Cd option INSECURE .
.El
.It Dv STRIOCDETACH Fa "pid_t"
Wake up the process if it is waiting for an answer, and detach from
it.
.It Dv STRIOCANSWER Fa "struct systrace_answer"
Notify the
.Nm
facility in response to a
SYSTR_MSG_ASK
message what to do with a system call that was assigned a policy of
.Dv SYSTR_POLICY_ASK .
.Bd -literal
struct systrace_answer {
	pid_t stra_pid;     /* PID of process being traced */
	int32_t stra_policy;    /* Policy to assign */
	int32_t stra_error;     /* Return value of denied syscall
	                       (will return EPERM if zero) */
	int32_t stra_flags;
#define	SYSTR_FLAGS_RESULT 0x0001    /* Report syscall result */
};
.Ed
.Pp
Valid return values for
.Em stra_policy
are
SYSTR_POLICY_PERMIT, SYSTR_POLICY_ASK and SYSTR_POLICY_NEVER.
.It Dv STRIOCIO Fa "struct systrace_io"
Copy data in/out of the process being traced.
.Bd -literal
struct systrace_io {
	pid_t strio_pid;    /* PID of process being traced */
	int32_t strio_ops;
#define	SYSTR_READ	1
#define	SYSTR_WRITE	2
	void *strio_offs;
	void *strio_addr;
	size_t strio_len;
};
.Ed
.It Dv STRIOCPOLICY Fa "struct systrace_policy"
Manipulate the set of policies.
.Bd -literal
struct systrace_policy {
	int strp_op;
#define	SYSTR_POLICY_NEW	1    /* Allocate a new policy */
#define	SYSTR_POLICY_ASSIGN	2    /* Assign policy to process */
#define	SYSTR_POLICY_MODIFY	3    /* Modify an entry */
	int32_t strp_num;
	union {
		struct {
			int16_t code;
#define SYSTR_POLICY_ASK	0
#define SYSTR_POLICY_PERMIT	1
#define SYSTR_POLICY_NEVER	2
			int16_t policy;
		} assign;
		pid_t pid;
		int32_t maxents;
	} strp_data;
#define strp_pid	strp_data.pid
#define strp_maxents	strp_data.maxents
#define strp_code	strp_data.assign.code
#define strp_policy	strp_data.assign.policy
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Dv SYSTR_POLICY_NEW
operation allocates a new policy with all entries initialized to
.Dv SYSTR_POLICY_ASK ,
and returns the new policy number into
.Va strp_num .
The
.Dv SYSTR_POLICY_ASSIGN
operation attaches the policy identified by
.Va strp_num
to
.Va strp_pid ,
with a maximum of
.Va strp_maxents
entries.
The
.Dv SYSTR_POLICY_MODIFY
operation changes the entry indexed by
.Va strp_code
to
.Va strp_policy .
.It Dv STRIOCGETCWD Fa "pid_t"
Set the working directory of the current process to that of the
specified process.
.It Dv STRIOCRESCWD
Restore the working directory of the current process.
