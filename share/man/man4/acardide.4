.Sh NAME
.Nm acardide
.Nd acard IDE disk controllers driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "acardide* at pci? dev ? function ? flags 0x0000"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the following IDE controllers:
.Bl -item -offset indent
.It
Acard ATP850U Ultra33
.It
Acard ATP860 Ultra66
.It
Acard ATP860-A Ultra66
.It
Acard ATP865-A Ultra100
.El
.Pp
It provides the interface with the hardware for the
.Xr ata 4
driver.
.Pp
The 0x0002 flag forces the
.Nm
driver to disable DMA on chipsets for which DMA would normally be
enabled.
This can be used as a debugging aid, or to work around
problems where the IDE controller is wired up to the system incorrectly.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ata 4 ,
.Xr atapi 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr pciide 4 ,
.Xr wd 4 ,
.Xr wdc 4
.Sh BUGS
The timings used for the PIO and DMA modes for controllers listed above
are for a PCI bus running at 30 or 33 MHz.
This driver may not work properly on overclocked systems.
