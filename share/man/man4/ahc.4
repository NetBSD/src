The
.Nm
device driver supports SCSI controllers based on Adaptec AIC77xx
and AIC78xx SCSI host adapter chips found on many motherboards as well as
Adaptec SCSI controller cards.
.Pp
Driver features include support for twin and wide buses,
fast, ultra or ultra2 synchronous transfers depending on controller type,
.\" tagged queuing, SCB paging, and target mode.
tagged queuing and SCB paging.
.Pp
Memory mapped I/O can be enabled for PCI devices with the
.Dq Dv AHC_ALLOW_MEMIO
configuration option.
Memory mapped I/O is more efficient than the alternative, programmed I/O.
Most PCI BIOSes will map devices so that either technique for communicating
with the card is available.
In some cases,
usually when the PCI device is sitting behind a PCI->PCI bridge,
the BIOS may fail to properly initialize the chip for memory mapped I/O.
The typical symptom of this problem is a system hang if memory mapped I/O
is attempted.
Most modern motherboards perform the initialization correctly and work fine
with this option enabled.
.Pp
.\" Individual controllers may be configured to operate in the target role
.\" through the
.\" .Dq Dv AHC_TMODE_ENABLE
.\" configuration option.
.\" The value assigned to this option should be a bitmap
.\" of all units where target mode is desired.
.\" For example, a value of 0x25, would enable target mode on units 0, 2, and 5.
.\" .Pp
Per target configuration performed in the SCSI-Select menu, accessible at boot
in non-EISA models,
or through an EISA configuration utility for EISA models,
is honored by this driver.
This includes synchronous/asynchronous transfers,
maximum synchronous negotiation rate,
wide transfers,
disconnection,
the host adapter's SCSI ID,
and,
in the case of EISA Twin Channel controllers,
the primary channel selection.
For systems that store non-volatile settings in a system specific manner
rather than a serial EEPROM directly connected to the aic7xxx controller,
the BIOS must be enabled for the driver to access this information.
This restriction applies to all EISA and many motherboard configurations.
.Pp
Note that I/O addresses are determined automatically by the probe routines,
but care should be taken when using a 284x
.Pq VESA No local bus controller
in an EISA system.
The jumpers setting the I/O area for the 284x should match the EISA
slot into which the card is inserted to prevent conflicts with other
EISA cards.
.Pp
Performance and feature sets vary throughout the aic7xxx product line.
The following table provides a comparison of the different chips supported
by the
.Nm
driver.
Note that wide and twin channel features, although always supported
by a particular chip, may be disabled in a particular motherboard
or card design.

.Sh SCSI CONTROL BLOCKS (SCBs)
Every transaction sent to a device on the SCSI bus is assigned a
.Sq SCSI Control Block
(SCB).
The SCB contains all of the information required by the controller
to process a transaction.
The chip feature table lists the number of SCBs that can be stored
in on-chip memory.
All chips with model numbers greater than or equal to 7870 allow
for the on chip SCB space to be augmented with external SRAM up to
a maximum of 255 SCBs.
Very few Adaptec controller configurations have external SRAM.
.Pp
If external SRAM is not available, SCBs are a limited resource.
Using the SCBs in a straight forward manner would only allow the driver to
handle as many concurrent transactions as there are physical SCBs.
To fully use the SCSI bus and the devices on it,
requires much more concurrency.
The solution to this problem is
.Em SCB Paging ,
a concept similar to memory paging.
SCB paging takes advantage of the fact that devices usually disconnect
from the SCSI bus for long periods of time without talking to the
controller.
The SCBs for disconnected transactions are only of use to the
controller when the transfer is resumed.
When the host queues another transaction for the controller to
execute, the controller firmware will use a free SCB if one is
available.
Otherwise, the state of the most recently disconnected (and therefore
most likely to stay disconnected) SCB is saved, via DMA, to host
memory, and the local SCB reused to start the new transaction.
This allows the controller to queue up to
255 transactions regardless of the amount of SCB space.
Since the local SCB space serves as a cache for disconnected
transactions, the more SCB space available, the less host bus
traffic consumed saving and restoring SCB data.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver appeared in
.Fx 2.0
and
.Nx 1.1 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver, the AIC7xxx sequencer-code assembler,
and the firmware running on the aic7xxx chips was written by
.An Justin T. Gibbs .
.Nx
porting is done by Stefan Grefen, Charles M. Hannum,
Michael Graff, Jason R. Thorpe, Pete Bentley,
Frank van der Linden and Noriyuki Soda.
.Sh BUGS
Some Quantum drives (at least the Empire 2100 and 1080s) will not run on an
AIC7870 Rev B in synchronous mode at 10MHz.
Controllers with this problem have a
42 MHz clock crystal on them and run slightly above 10MHz.
This confuses the drive and hangs the bus.
Setting a maximum synchronous negotiation rate of 8MHz in the SCSI-Select
utility will allow normal operation.
