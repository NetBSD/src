.Sh NAME
.Nm amdtemp
.Nd AMD CPU on-die digital thermal sensor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "amdtemp* at pchb?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the on-die digital thermal sensor present
on AMD K8, AMD Barcelona, AMD Phenom, AMD Griffin, and AMD Fusion CPUs.
.Pp
These sensors were officially introduced in AMD K8 Revision F processors,
and provide 0.5 degC accuracy.
Precision was improved in Revision
G chips, which provide two more bits for 0.25 degC steppings.
Each core
has two temperature sensors, and there are up to two cores per CPU socket.
.Pp
AMD Barcelona, AMD Phenom, AMD Griffin, and AMD Fusion provide 0.125 degC
accuracy and provide one temperature sensor for each CPU socket.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver reports temperatures through the
.Xr envsys 4
API.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.4
named
.Dq kate .
It was then ported to
.Nx 5.0 .
The driver has been renamed with support for newer AMD CPUs.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Constantine A. Murenin Aq cnst@openbsd.org
whilst at the University of Waterloo.
It was adapted to
.Nx
by
.An Christoph Egger .
