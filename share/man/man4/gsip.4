.Sh NAME
.Nm gsip
.Nd National Semiconductor DP83820 Gigabit Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "gsip* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Pp
Configuration of PHYs may also be necessary.  See
.Xr mii 4 .
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports Gigabit Ethernet interfaces based on the
National Semiconductor DP83820 Gigabit Ethernet chips.
.Pp
The National Semiconductor DP83820 is found on NetGear GA-622,
Asante FriendlyNet GigaNIX, and other low-cost Gigabit Ethernet
cards.  It uses an external PHY or an external 10-bit interface.
.Pp
The DP83820 supports VLAN tag insertion/removal in hardware.  The
.Nm
driver supports this feature of the chip.
.Pp
The DP83820 chip is a close relative of the DP83815 10/100 Ethernet
chip, which is supported by the
.Xr sip 4
driver, hence the
.Nm
name.
.\" .Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.\" XXX too be done.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Nx 1.6 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver does not support the IPv4/TCP/UDP checksumming features
of the DP83820 chip.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver does not support transmission or reception of jumbo Ethernet
frames.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver does not support the 10-bit interface, which is required in
order to support fiber-optic media.
