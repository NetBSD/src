.Sh NAME
.Nm tda
.Nd TDA8444 fan speed controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "tda0 at iic1 addr 0x24: fan-control"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the TDA8444 DAC used to control the fan speeds
in Sun Blade 1000 and Blade 2000 systems.
The speed of the CPU fan and of the system fan are automatically adjusted
every 60 seconds, based on the currently reported CPU and system
temperatures, respectively.
.Pp
The speed-related values are made available through the
.Xr envstat 8
interface.
The range of the values are:
.Bl -column -offset indent ".Sy System temperature" ".Sy Minimum" ".Sy Maximum"
.It Sy Ta Sy Minimum Ta Sy Maximum
.It Li CPU temperature Ta <=57 Ta >=67
.It Li System temperature Ta <=20 Ta >=30
.It Li Speed value Ta 12 Ta 63
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr admtemp 4 ,
.Xr envstat 8
.Sh BUGS
The temperatures are reported as
.Sq internal
and
.Sq external
instead of
.Sq system
and
.Sq CPU ,
respectively.
