.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
framework provides several disciplines for queuing outgoing network packets.
While traffic shaping is perhaps the most prominent example,
.Nm
provides also other measures related to QoS.
The framework has been integrated to the
.Xr pf 4
packet filter since
.Nx 4.0 .
.Pp
At the implementation level
.Nm
modifies the interface packet queues.
Therefore the driver modifications described in
.Xr altq 9
are required in order to use a certain network card with
.Nm .
