.Sh NAME
.Nm options
.Nd Miscellaneous kernel configuration options
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd options ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page describes a number of miscellaneous kernel
configuration options that may be specified in a kernel config
file.
See
.Xr config 8
for information on how to configure and build kernels.
.Em Note:
Options are passed to the compile process as -D flags to the C
compiler.
.Ss Compatibility Options
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd options COMPAT_09
Enable binary compatibility with
.Nx 0.9 .
This enables support for
16-bit user, group, and process ids (following revisions support
32-bit identifiers),
It also allows the use of the deprecated
.Xr getdomainname 3 ,
.Xr setdomainname 3 ,
and
.Xr uname 3
syscalls.
This option also allows using numeric filesystem identifiers rather
than strings.
Post
.Nx 0.9
versions use string identifiers.
.It Cd options COMPAT_10
Enable binary compatibility with
.Nx 1.0 .
This option allows the use of the filesystem name of
.Dq ufs
as an alias for
.Dq ffs .
The name
.Dq ffs
should be used post 1.0 in
.Pa /etc/fstab
and other files.
It also adds old syscalls for the
.At V
shared memory interface.
This was changed post 1.0 to work on 64-bit architectures.
This option also enables
.Dq sgtty
compatibility, without which programs using the old interface produce
an
.Dq inappropriate ioctl
error.
.It Cd options COMPAT_11
Enable binary compatibility with
.Nx 1.1 .
This allows binaries running on the i386 port to gain direct access to
the io ports by opening
.Pa /dev/io
read/write.
This functionality was replaced by
.Xr i386_iopl 2
post 1.1.
On the
.Tn Atari
port, the location of the disk label was moved after 1.1.
When the
.Em COMPAT_11
option is set, the kernel will read (pre) 1.1 style disk labels as a
last resort.
When a disklabel is re-written, the old style label will be replaced
with a post 1.1 style label.
.It Cd options COMPAT_12
Enable binary compatibility with
.Nx 1.2 .
This allows the use of old syscalls for
.Fn reboot
and
.Fn swapon .
The syscall numbers were changed post 1.2 to add functionality to the
.Xr reboot 2
syscall, and the new
.Xr swapctl 2
interface was introduced.
.It Cd options COMPAT_13
Enable binary compatibility with
.Nx 1.3 .
This allows the use of old syscalls for
.Fn sigaltstack ,
and also enables the old
.Xr swapctl 2
command
.Dv SWAP_STATS
(now called
.Dv SWAP_OSTATS ) ,
which does not include the
.Fa se_path
member of
.Va struct swapent .
.It Cd options COMPAT_43
Enables compatibility with
.Bx 4.3 .
This adds an old syscall for
.Xr lseek 2 .
It also adds the ioctls for
.Dv TIOCGETP
and
.Dv TIOCSETP .
The return values for
.Xr getpid 2 ,
.Xr getgid 2 ,
and
.Xr getuid 2
syscalls are modified as well, to return the parent's pid and
uid as well as the current process's.
It also enables the deprecated
.Dv NTTYDISC
terminal line discipline.
It also provides backwards compatibility with
.Dq old
SIOC[GS]IF{ADDR,DSTADDR,BRDADDR,NETMASK} interface ioctls, including
binary compatibility with code written before the introduction of the
sa_len field in sockaddrs.
It also enables
support for some older pre
.Bx 4.4
socket calls.
.It Cd options COMPAT_SVR4
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with
.At V.4
applications built for the same architecture.
This currently includes the sparc and i386.
.It Cd options COMPAT_LINUX
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with Linux ELF and
.Xr a.out 5
applications built for the same architecture.
This is currently limited to the i386.
.It Cd options COMPAT_SUNOS
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with
.Tn SunOS 4.1
applications built for the same architecture.
This currently includes the sparc and most or all m68k platforms.
.It Cd options COMPAT_ULTRIX
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with
.Tn Ultrix
applications built for the same architecture.
This currently is limited to the pmax.
The functionality of this option is unknown.
.It Cd options COMPAT_FREEBSD
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with
.Fx
applications built for the same architecture.
This is obviously limited to the i386.
.It Cd options COMPAT_HPUX
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with
.Tn HP/UX
applications built for the same architecture.
This is limited to the hp300 port, and has some known bugs.
A limited set of programs do work.
.It Cd options COMPAT_IBCS2
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with iBCS2 applications built for the same architecture.
This is currently limited to the i386.
.It Cd options COMPAT_OSF1
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with
.Tn Digital
.Ux
.Po
formerly
.Tn OSF/1
.Pc
applications built for the same architecture.
This is currently limited to the alpha, and may not even work.
.It Cd options COMPAT_NOMID
Enable compatibility with
.Xr a.out 5
executables that lack a machine ID.
This includes
.Nx 0.8 Ns 's
ZMAGIC format, and 386BSD and BSDI's
QMAGIC, NMAGIC, and OMAGIC
.Xr a.out 5
formats.
.El
.Ss Debugging Options
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd options DDB
Compiles in a kernel debugger for diagnosing kernel problems.
See
.Xr ddb 4
for details.
.Em NOTE:
not available on all architectures.
.It Cd options DDB_FROMCONSOLE=integer
If set to non-zero, DDB may be entered by sending a break on a serial
console or by a special key sequence on a graphics console.
A value of "0" ignores console breaks or key sequences,
It not explicitly specified, the default value is "1".
Note that this sets the value of the
.Em ddb.fromconsole
.Xr sysctl 3
variable which may be changed at run time -- see
.Xr sysctl 8
for details. 
.It Cd options DDB_HISTORY_SIZE=integer
If this is non-zero, enable history editing in the kernel debugger
and set the size of the history to this value.
.It Cd options DDB_ONPANIC
If set to non-zero, the DDB will be entered upon kernel panic.
The default if not specified is "1".
Note that this sets the value of the
.Em ddb.onpanic
.Xr sysctl 3
variable which may be changed at run time -- see
.Xr sysctl 8
for details.
.It Cd options KGDB
Compiles in a remote kernel debugger stub for diagnosing kernel problems
using the
.Dq remote target
feature of gdb.
See
.Xr gdb 1
for details.
.Em NOTE:
not available on all architectures.
.It Cd makeoptions DEBUG="-g"
The -g flag causes
.Pa netbsd.gdb
to be built in addition to
.Pa netbsd .
.Pa netbsd.gdb
is useful for debugging kernel crash dumps with gdb.
The command
.Dl gdb -k
invokes gdb in kernel debugger mode.
See
.Xr gdb 1
for details.
This also turns on
.Em options DEBUG
(which see).
.It Cd options DEBUG
Turns on miscellaneous kernel debugging.
Since options are turned into preprocessor defines (see above),
.Em options DEBUG
is equivalent to doing a
.Em #define DEBUG
throughout the kernel.
Much of the kernel has
.Em #ifdef DEBUG
conditionalized debugging code.
Note that many parts of the kernel (typically device drivers) include their own
.Em #ifdef XXX_DEBUG
conditionals instead.
This option also turns on certain other options,
which may decrease system performance.
.It Cd options DIAGNOSTIC
Adds code to the kernel that does internal consistency checks.
This code will cause the kernel to panic if corruption of internal data
structures is detected.
.It Cd options KTRACE
Add hooks for the system call tracing facility, which allows users to
watch the system call invocation behavior of processes.
See
.Xr ktrace 1
for details.
.It Cd options MSGBUFSIZE=integer
This option sets the size of the kernel message buffer.
This buffer holds the kernel output of
.Fn printf
when not (yet) read by
.Xr syslogd 8 .
This is particularly useful when the system has crashed and you wish to lookup
the kernel output from just before the crash.
Also, since the autoconfig output becomes more and more verbose,
it sometimes happens that the message buffer overflows before
.Xr syslogd 8
was able to read it.
Note that not all systems are capable of obtaining a variable sized message
buffer.
There are also some systems on which memory contents are not preserved
across reboots.
.It Cd options MALLOCLOG
Enables an event log for
.Xr malloc 9 .
Useful for tracking down
.Dq Data modified on freelist
and
.Dq multiple free
problems.
.It Cd options MALLOCLOGSIZE=integer
Defines the number of entries in the malloc log.
Default is 100000 entries.
.El
.Ss File Systems
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd file-system FFS
Includes code implementing the Berkeley Fast File System
.Em ( FFS ) .
Most machines need this if they are not running diskless.
.It Cd file-system EXT2FS
Includes code implementing the Second Extended File System
.Em ( EXT2FS ) .
This is the most commonly used file system on the Linux operating system,
and is provided here for compatibility.
Some of the specific features of
.Em EXT2FS
like the "behavior on errors" are not implemented.
This file system can't be used with UID or GID greater than 65535.
See
.Xr mount_ext2fs 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system LFS
.Em [EXPERIMENTAL]
Include the Log-structured File System
.Em ( LFS ) .
See
.Xr mount_lfs 8
and
.Xr newlfs 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system MFS
Include the Memory File System
.Em ( MFS ) .
This file system stores files in swappable memory, and produces
notable performance improvements when it is used as the file store
for
.Pa /tmp
and similar file systems.
See
.Xr mount_mfs 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system NFS
Include the client side of the Network File System
.Pq Tn NFS
remote file sharing protocol.
Although the bulk of the code implementing
.Tn NFS
is kernel based, several user level daemons are needed for it to work.
See
.Xr mount_nfs 8
and
.Xr nfsiod 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system CD9660
Includes code for the
.Tn ISO
9660 + Rock Ridge file system, which is the standard file system on many
.Tn CD-ROM
discs.
Useful primarily if you have a
.Tn CD-ROM
drive.
See
.Xr mount_cd9660 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system MSDOSFS
Includes the
.Tn MS-DOS
FAT file system, which is reportedly still used
by unfortunate people who have not heard about
.Nx .
Also implements the
.Tn Windows 95
extensions to the same, which permit the use of longer, mixed case
file names.
See
.Xr mount_msdos 8
and
.Xr fsck_msdos 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system FDESC
Includes code for a file system, conventionally mounted on
.Pa /dev/fd ,
which permits access to the per-process file descriptor space via
special files in the file system.
See
.Xr mount_fdesc 8
for details.
Note that this facility is redundant, and thus unneeded on most
.Nx
systems, since the
.Xr fd 4
pseudodevice driver already provides identical functionality.
On most
.Nx
systems, instances of
.Xr fd 4
are mknoded under
.Pa /dev/fd/
and on
.Pa /dev/stdin ,
.Pa /dev/stdout ,
and
.Pa /dev/stderr .
.It Cd file-system KERNFS
Includes code which permits the mounting of a special file system
(normally mounted on
.Pa /kern )
in which files representing various kernel variables and parameters
may be found.
See
.Xr mount_kernfs 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system NULLFS
Includes code for a loopback file system.
This permits portions of the file hierarchy to be re-mounted in other places.
The code really exists to provide an example of a stackable file system layer.
See
.Xr mount_null 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system PORTAL
.Em [EXPERIMENTAL]
Includes the portal filesystem.
This permits interesting tricks like opening
.Tn TCP
sockets by opening files in the file system.
The portal file system is conventionally mounted on
.Pa /p
and is partially implemented by a special daemon.
See
.Xr mount_portal 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system PROCFS
Includes code for a special file system (conventionally mounted on
.Pa /proc )
in which the process space becomes visible in the file system.
Among
other things, the memory spaces of processes running on the system are
visible as files, and signals may be sent to processes by writing to
.Pa ctl
files in the procfs namespace.
See
.Xr mount_procfs 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system UMAPFS
Includes a loopback file system in which user and group ids may be
remapped -- this can be useful when mounting alien file systems with
different uids and gids than the local system.
See
.Xr mount_umap 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system UNION
.Em [EXPERIMENTAL]
Includes code for the union file system, which permits directories to
be mounted on top of each other in such a way that both file systems
remain visible -- this permits tricks like allowing writing (and the
deleting of files) on a read-only file system like a
.Tn CD-ROM
by mounting a local writable file system on top of the read-only file system.
See
.Xr mount_union 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system CODA
.Em [EXPERIMENTAL]
Includes code for the Coda file system.
Coda is a distributed file system like NFS and AFS.  It is
freely available, like NFS, but it functions much like AFS in being a
"stateful" file system.  Both Coda and AFS cache files on your local
machine to improve performance.  Then Coda goes a step further than AFS
by letting you access the cached files when there is no available
network, viz. disconnected laptops and network outages.  In Coda, both
the client and server are outside the kernel which makes them easier
to experiment with.  Coda is available for several UNIX and non-UNIX
platforms.
See http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu for more details.
NOTE: You also need to enable the pseudo-device, vcoda, for the Coda
filesystem to work.
.El
.Ss File System Options
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd options NFSSERVER
Include the server side of the
.Em NFS
(Network File System) remote file sharing protocol.
Although the bulk of the code implementing
.Em NFS
is kernel based, several user level daemons are needed for it to
work.
See
.Xr mountd 8
and
.Xr nfsd 8
for details.
.It Cd options QUOTA
Enables kernel support for file system quotas.
See
.Xr quotaon 8 ,
.Xr edquota 8 ,
and
.Xr quota 1
for details.
Note that quotas only work on
.Dq ffs
file systems, although
.Xr rpc.rquotad 8
permits them to be accessed over
.Em NFS .
.It Cd options FFS_EI
Enable ``Endian-Independant'' FFS support.
This allows a system to mount an FFS filesystem created for another
architecture, at a small performance cost for all FFS filesytems.
See also
.Xr newfs 8 ,
.Xr fsck_ffs 8 ,
.Xr dumpfs 8
for filesystem byte order status and manipulation.
.It Cd options NVNODE=integer
This option sets the size of the cache used by the name-to-inode translation
routines, (a.k.a. the
.Fn namei
cache, though called by many other names in the kernel source).
By default, this cache has
.Dv NPROC
(set as 20 + 16 * MAXUSERS) * (80 + NPROC / 8) entries.
A reasonable way to derive a value of
.Dv NVNODE ,
should you notice a large number of namei cache misses with a tool such as
.Xr systat 1 ,
is to examine your system's current computed value with
.Xr sysctl 8 ,
(which calls this parameter "kern.maxvnodes") and to increase this value
until either the namei cache hit rate improves or it is determined that
your system does not benefit substantially from an increase in the size of
the namei cache.
.It Cd options EXT2FS_SYSTEM_FLAGS
This option changes the behavior of the APPEND and IMMUTABLE flags
for a file on an
.Em EXT2FS
filesystem.
Without this option, the superuser or owner of the file can
set and clear them.
With this option, only the superuser can set them, and
they can't be cleared if the securelevel is greater than 0.
See also
.Xr chflags 1 .
.It Cd options NFS_BOOT_BOOTP
Enable use of the BOOTP protocol (RFC 951, 1048) to get configuration
information if NFS is used to mount the root file system.
See
.Xr diskless 8
for details.
.It Cd options NFS_BOOT_DHCP
Same as
.Dq NFS_BOOT_BOOTP
, but use the DHCP extensions to the
BOOTP protocol (RFC 1541).
.It Cd options NFS_BOOT_BOOTPARAM
Enable use of the BOOTPARAM protocol, consisting of RARP and
BOOTPARAM RPC, to get configuration information if NFS
is used to mount the root file system.
See
.Xr diskless 8
for details.
.It Cd options NFS_BOOT_RWSIZE=value
Set the initial NFS read and write sizes for diskless-boot requests.
The normal default is 8Kbytes.  This option provides a way to lower
the value (e.g., to 1024 bytes) as a workaround for buggy network
interface cards or boot proms. Once booted, the read and write request
sizes can be increased by remounting the filesystem. See
.Xr mount_nfs 8
for details.
.El
.Ss Miscellaneous Options
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd options LKM
Enable loadable kernel modules.
See
.Xr lkm 4
for details.
.Em NOTE :
not available on all architectures.
.It Cd options INSECURE
Hardwires the kernel security level at -1.
This means that the system
always runs in secure level 0 mode, even when running multiuser.
See the manual page for
.Xr init 8
for details on the implications of this.
The kernel secure level may manipulated by the superuser by altering the
.Em kern.securelevel
.Xr sysctl 3
variable (the secure level may only be lowered by a call from process ID 1,
i.e.
.Xr init 8 ) .
See also
.Xr sysctl 8
and
.Xr sysctl 3 .
.It Cd options UCONSOLE
Normally, only the superuser can execute the
.Dv TIOCCONS
.Xr ioctl 2 ,
which redirects console output to a non-console tty.
See
.Xr tty 4
for details.
This option permits any user to execute the
.Dv TIOCCONS
.Xr ioctl 2 .
This is useful on
machines such as personal workstations which run
.Xr X 1
servers, where one would prefer to permit console output to be
viewed in a window without requiring a suid root program to do it.
.It Cd options MACHINE_NONCONTIG
This option changes part of the VM/pmap interface, to allow for
non-contiguous memory.
On some ports it is not an option.
These ports typically only use one of the interfaces.
.It Cd options MEMORY_DISK_HOOKS
This option allows for some machine dependent functions to be called when
the
.Tn RAM
disk driver is configured.
This can result in automatically loading a
.Tn RAM
disk from floppy on open (among other things).
.It Cd options MEMORY_DISK_IS_ROOT
Forces the
.Tn RAM
disk to be the root device.
This can only be overridden when
the kernel is booted in the 'ask-for-root' mode.
.It Cd options NTP
Turns on in-kernel precision timekeeping support used by software
implementing
.Em NTP
(Network Time Protocol, RFC1305).
The
.Em NTP
option adds an in-kernel Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) for normal
.Em NTP
operation, and a Frequency-Locked Loop (FLL) for intermittently-connected
operation.
.Xr xntpd 8
will employ a user-level PLL when kernel support is unavailable,
but the in-kernel version has lower latency and more precision, and
so typically keeps much better time.
The interface to the kernel
.Em NTP
support is provided by the
.Xr ntp_adjtime 2
and
.Xr ntp_gettime 2
system calls, which are intended for use by
.Xr xntpd 8
and are enabled by the option.
On systems with sub-microsecond resolution timers, or where (HZ / 100000)
is not an integer, the
.Em NTP
option also enables extended-precision arithmetic to keep track of
fractional clock ticks at NTP time-format precision.
.It Cd options PPS_SYNC
This option enables a kernel serial line discipline for receiving time
phase signals from an external reference clock such as a radio clock.
(The
.Em NTP
option (which see) must be on if the
.Em PPS_SYNC
option is used.)
Some reference clocks generate a Pulse Per Second (PPS) signal in
phase with their time source.
The
.Em PPS
line discipline receives this signal on either the data leads
or the DCD control lead of a serial port.
.Em NTP
uses the PPS signal to discipline the local clock oscillator to a high
degree of precision (typically less than 50 microseconds in time and
0.1 ppm in accuracy).
.Em PPS
can also generate a serial output pulse when the system receives a PPS
interrupt.
This can be used to measure the system interrupt latency and thus calibrate
.Em NTP
to account for it.
Using
.Em PPS
usually requires a
gadget box
to convert from TTL to RS-232 signal levels.
The gadget box and PPS are described in more detail in the HTML documentation
shipped with the xntpd distribution.
.It Cd option SETUIDSCRIPTS
Allows scripts with the setuid bit set to execute as the effective
user rather than the real user, just like binary executables.
.Pp
.Em NOTE :
Using this option will also enable
.Em option FDSCRIPTS
.It Cd option FDSCRIPTS
Allows execution of scripts with the execute bit set, but not the
read bit, by opening the file and passing the file descriptor to
the shell, rather than the filename.
.Pp
.Em NOTE :
Execute only (non-readable) scripts will have
.Va argv[0]
set to
.Pa /dev/fd/* .
What this option allows as far as security is
concerned, is the ability to safely ensure that the correct script
is run by the interpreter, as it is passed as an already open file.
.It Cd options RTC_OFFSET=integer
The kernel (and typically the hardware battery backed-up clock on
those machines that have one) keeps time in
.Em UTC
(Universal Coordinated Time, once known as
.Em GMT ,
or Greenwich Mean Time)
and not in the time of the local time zone.
The
.Em RTC_OFFSET
option is used on some ports (such as the i386) to tell the kernel
that the hardware clock is offset from
.Em UTC
by the specified number of minutes.
This is typically used when a machine boots several operating
systems and one of them wants the hardware clock to run in the
local time zone and not in
.Em UTC ,
e.g.
.Em RTC_OFFSET=300
means
the hardware clock is set to US Eastern Time (300 minutes behind
.Em UTC ) ,
and not
.Em UTC .
(Note:
.Em RTC_OFFSET
is used to initialize a kernel variable named
.Va rtc_offset
which is the source actually used to determine the clock offset, and
which may be accessed via the kern.rtc_offset sysctl variable.
See
.Xr sysctl 8
and
.Xr sysctl 3
for details.
Since the kernel clock is initialized from the hardware clock very
early in the boot process, it is not possible to meaningfully change
.Va rtc_offset
in system initialization scripts.
Changing this value currently may only be done at kernel compile
time or by patching the kernel and rebooting).
.It Cd options KMEMSTATS
The kernel memory allocator,
.Xr malloc 9 ,
will keep statistics on its performance if this option is enabled.
Unfortunately, this option therefore essentially disables the
.Fn MALLOC
and
.Fn FREE
forms of the memory allocator, which are used to enhance the performance
of certain critical sections of code in the kernel.
This option therefore can lead to a significant decrease in the
performance of certain code in the kernel if enabled.
Examples of such code include the
.Fn namei
routine, the
.Xr ccd 4
driver,
the
.Xr ncr 4
driver,
and much of the networking code.
.It Cd options MAXUPRC=integer
Sets the
.Em RLIMIT_NPROC
resource limit, which specifies the maximum number of simultaneous
processes a user is permitted to run, for process 0;
this value is inherited by its child processes.
It defaults to
.Em CHILD_MAX ,
which is currently defined to be 80.
Setting
.Em MAXUPRC
to a value less than
.Em CHILD_MAX
is not permitted, as this would result in a violation of the semantics of
.St -p1003.1-90 .
.It Cd options SHORTCORENAME
If set, process core dumps are named 
.Nm core .
If not specified, they are named
.Nm programname.core 
(the default in 4.4BSD). Note that this changes the value of the 
.Em kern.shortcorename 
sysctl variable which may be changed at run time. See
.Xr sysctl 8
and
.Xr sysctl 3
for details. 
.El
.Ss Networking Options
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd options GATEWAY
Enables
.Em IPFORWARDING
(which see)
and (on most ports) increases the size of
.Em NMBCLUSTERS
(which see).
In general,
.Em GATEWAY
is used to indicate that a system should act as a router, and
.Em IPFORWARDING
is not invoked directly.
(Note that
.Em GATEWAY
has no impact on protocols other than
.Tn IP ,
such as
.Tn CLNP
or
.Tn XNS ) .
.It Cd options IPFORWARDING
Enables IP routing behavior.
With this option enabled, the machine
will forward IP datagrams between its interfaces that are destined for
other machines.
Note that even without this option, the kernel will
still forward some packets (such as source routed packets) -- removing
.Em GATEWAY
and
.Em IPFORWARDING
is insufficient to stop all routing through a bastion host on a
firewall -- source routing is controlled independently.
To turn off source routing, use
.Em options IPFORWSRCRT=0
(which see).
Note that IP forwarding may be turned on and off independently of the
setting of the
.Em IPFORWARDING
option through the use of the
.Em net.inet.ip.forwarding
sysctl variable.
If
.Em net.inet.ip.forwarding
is 1, IP forwarding is on.
See
.Xr sysctl 8
and
.Xr sysctl 3
for details.
.It Cd options IPFORWSRCRT=value
If
.Em value
is set to zero, source routing of IP datagrams is turned off.
If
.Em value
is set to one (the default) or the option is absent, source routed IP
datagrams are forwarded by the machine.
Note that source routing of IP packets may be turned on and off
independently of the setting of the
.Em IPFORWSRCRT
option through the use of the
.Em net.inet.ip.forwsrcrt
sysctl variable.
If
.Em net.inet.ip.forwsrcrt
is 1, forwarding of source routed IP datagrams is on.
See
.Xr sysctl 8
and
.Xr sysctl 3
for details.
.It Cd options MROUTING
Includes support for IP multicast routers.
You certainly want
.Em INET
with this.
Multicast routing is controlled by the
.Xr mrouted 8
daemon.
.It Cd options INET
Includes support for the
.Tn TCP/IP
protocol stack.
You almost certainly want this.
See
.Xr inet 4
for details.
This option is currently required.
.It Cd options MCLSHIFT=value
This option is the base-2 logarithm of the size of mbuf clusters.
The
.Bx
networking stack keeps network packets in a linked
list, or chain, of kernel buffer objects called mbufs.
The system provides larger mbuf clusters as an optimization for
large packets, instead of using long chains for large packets.
The mbuf cluster size,
or
.Em MCLBYTES,
must be a power of two, and is computed as two raised to the power
.Em MCLSHIFT .
On systems with Ethernet network adaptors,
.Em MCLSHIFT
is often set to 11, giving 2048-byte mbuf clusters, large enough to
hold a 1500-byte
.Tn Ethernet
frame in a single cluster.
Systems with network interfaces supporting larger frame sizes like
.Tn ATM ,
.Tn FDDI ,
or
.Tn HIPPI
may perform better with
.Em MCLSHIFT
set to 12 or 13, giving mbuf cluster sizes of 4096 and 8192 bytes,
respectively.
.It Cd options NS
Include support for the
.Tn Xerox
.Tn XNS
protocol stack.
See
.Xr ns 4
for details.
.It Cd options ISO,TPIP
Include support for the ubiquitous
.Tn OSI
protocol stack.
See
.Xr iso 4
for details.
.It Cd options EON
Include support for tunneling
.Tn OSI
protocols over
.Tn IP .
.It Cd options CCITT,LLC,HDLC
Include support for the
.Tn CCITT
(nee
.Tn ITU-TSS )
.Tn X.25
protocol stack.
The state of this code is currently unknown, and probably contains bugs.
.It Cd options NETATALK
Include support for the
.Tn AppleTalk
protocol stack.
The kernel provides provision for the
.Em Datagram Delivery Protocol
(DDP), providing SOCK_DGRAM support and
.Tn AppleTalk
routing.
This stack is used by the
.Em NETATALK
package, which adds support for
.Tn AppleTalk
server services via user libraries and applications.
.It Cd options IPNOPRIVPORTS
Normally, only root can bind a socket descriptor to a so-called
.Dq privileged
.Tn TCP
port, that is, a port number in the range 0-1023.
This option eliminates those checks from the kernel.
This can be useful if there is a desire to allow daemons without
privileges to bind those ports, e.g. on firewalls.
The security tradeoffs in doing this are subtle.
This option should only be used by experts.
.It Cd options TCP_COMPAT_42
.Tn TCP
bug compatibility with
.Bx 4.2 .
In
.Bx 4.2 ,
.Tn TCP
sequence numbers were 32-bit signed values.
Modern implementations of TCP use unsigned values.
This option clamps the initial sequence number to start in
the range 2^31 rather than the full unsigned range of 2^32.
Also, under
.Bx 4.2 ,
keepalive packets must contain at least one byte or else
the remote end would not respond.
.It Cd options PFIL_HOOKS
This option turns on the packet filter interface hooks.
See
.Xr pfil 9
for details.
.It Cd options IPFILTER_LOG
This option, in conjunction with
.Em pseudo-device ipfilter ,
enables logging of IP packets using ip-filter.
.It Cd options IPFILTER_DEFAULT_BLOCK
This option sets the default policy of ip-filter.
If it is set, ip-filter will block packets by default.
.It Cd options PPP_BSDCOMP
Enable support for BSD-compress
.Pq Sq bsdcomp
compression in ppp.
.It Cd options PPP_DEFLATE
Enable support for deflate
compression in ppp.
.It Cd options PPP_FILTER
This option turns on
.Xr pcap 3
based filtering for ppp connections.
This option is used by
.Xr pppd 8
which needs to be compiled with
.Em PPP_FILTER
defined (the current default).

for the default value, which is port specific.
Increase this value if you get
.Dq out of space in kmem_map
panics.
.\" , which mean you have run out of mallocable kernel memory.
.It Cd options BUFCACHE=value
Size of the buffer cache as a percentage of total available
.Tn RAM .
Ignored if BUFPAGES is also specified.
.It Cd options NBUF=value
.It Cd options BUFPAGES=value
These options set the number of pages available for the buffer cache.
Their default value is a machine dependent value, often calculated as
between 5% and 10% of total available
.Tn RAM .

.Ss amiga-specific Options
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd options BB060STUPIDROM
When the bootloader (which passes
.Tn AmigaOS
.Tn ROM
information) claims we have a 68060
.Tn CPU
without
.Tn FPU ,
go look into the Processor Configuration Register (PCR) to find out.
You need this with
.Tn Amiga
.Tn ROM Ns s
up to (at least) V40.xxx (OS3.1),
when you boot via the bootblocks and don't have a DraCo.
.It Cd options LIMITMEM=value
If there, limit the part of the first memory bank used by
.Nx
to value megabytes.
Default is unlimited.
.It Cd options NKPTADD=addvalue
.It Cd options NKPTADDSHIFT=shiftvalue
The
.Tn CPU
specific
.Tn MMU
table for the kernel is pre-allocated at kernel startup time.
Part of it is scaled with
.Va maxproc ,
to have enough room to hold the user program
.Tn MMU
tables; the second part is a fixed amount for the kernel itself.
.Pp
The third part accounts for the size of the file buffer cache.
Its size is either
.Dv NKPTADD
pages (if defined) or memory size in bytes divided by two to
the power of
.Dv NKPTADDSHIFT .
The default is undefined
.Dv NKPTADD
and
.Dv NKPTADDSHIFT=24 ,
allowing for 16 buffers per megabyte of main memory (while
a GENERIC kernel allocates about half of that).
When you get "can't get KPT page" panics, you should increase
.Dv NKPTADD
(if defined), or decrease
.Dv NKPTADDSHIFT
by one.

.It Cd options FALCON_SCSI
Include support for the 5380-SCSI configuration as found on the Falcon.
.It Cd options RELOC_KERNEL
If set, the kernel will relocate itself to TT-RAM, if possible.
This will give you a slightly faster system.
.Em Beware
that on some TT030 systems,
the system will frequently dump with MMU-faults with this option enabled.
.It Cd options SERCONSOLE
Allow the modem1-port to act as the system-console.
A carrier should be active on modem1 during system boot to active
the console functionality.

.Po
.Tn i386 ,
.Tn i486 ,
.Tn Pentium ,
or
.Tn Pentium Pro
.Pc .
If the appropriate class for your
.Tn CPU
is not configured, the kernel will use the highest class available
that will work.
In general, using the correct
.Tn CPU
class will result in the best performance.
At least one of these options must be present.
.It Cd options CPURESET_DELAY=value
specifies the time (in millisecond) to wait before doing a hardware reset
in the last phase of a reboot. This gives the user a chance to see error
messages from the shutdown operations (like NFS unmounts, buffer cache flush,
etc ...). Setting this to 0 will disable the delay. Default is 2 seconds.
.It Cd options MATH_EMULATE
Include the floating point emulator.
This is useful only for

Overrides the base memory size passed in from the boot block.
(Value given in kilobytes.)
Use this option only if the boot block reports the size incorrectly.
(Note that some
