.Dt OPTIONS 4
.Sh NAME
.Nm options
.Nd Miscellaneous kernel configuration options
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd options ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page describes a number of miscellaneous kernel
configuration options that may be specified in a kernel config
file.
See
.Xr config 8
for information on how to configure and build kernels.
.Em Note :
Options are passed to the compile process as -D flags to the C
compiler.
.Ss Compatibility Options
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd options COMPAT_09
Enable binary compatibility with
.Nx 0.9 .
This enables support for
16-bit user, group, and process ids (following revisions support
32-bit identifiers),
It also allows the use of the deprecated
.Xr getdomainname 3 ,
.Xr setdomainname 3 ,
and
.Xr uname 3
syscalls.
This option also allows using numeric filesystem identifiers rather
than strings.
Post
.Nx 0.9
versions use string identifiers.
.It Cd options COMPAT_10
Enable binary compatibility with
.Nx 1.0 .
This option allows the use of the filesystem name of
.Dq ufs
as an alias for
.Dq ffs .
The name
.Dq ffs
should be used post 1.0 in
.Pa /etc/fstab
and other files.
It also adds old syscalls for the
.At V
shared memory interface.
This was changed post 1.0 to work on 64-bit architectures.
This option also enables
.Dq sgtty
compatibility, without which programs using the old interface produce
an
.Dq inappropriate ioctl
error, and
.Pa /dev/io
only works when this option is set in the kernel,
see
.Xr io 4
on ports that support it.
.It Cd options COMPAT_11
Enable binary compatibility with
.Nx 1.1 .
This allows binaries running on the i386 port to gain direct access to
the io ports by opening
.Pa /dev/io
read/write.
This functionality was replaced by
.Xr i386_iopl 2
post 1.1.
On the
.Tn Atari
port, the location of the disk label was moved after 1.1.
When the
.Em COMPAT_11
option is set, the kernel will read (pre) 1.1 style disk labels as a
last resort.
When a disklabel is re-written, the old style label will be replaced
with a post 1.1 style label.
This also enables
.Em EXEC_ELF_NOTELESS
option.
.It Cd options COMPAT_12
Enable binary compatibility with
.Nx 1.2 .
This allows the use of old syscalls for
.Fn reboot
and
.Fn swapon .
The syscall numbers were changed post 1.2 to add functionality to the
.Xr reboot 2
syscall, and the new
.Xr swapctl 2
interface was introduced.
This also enables
.Em EXEC_ELF_NOTELESS
option.
.It Cd options COMPAT_13
Enable binary compatibility with
.Nx 1.3 .
This allows the use of old syscalls for
.Fn sigaltstack ,
and also enables the old
.Xr swapctl 2
command
.Dv SWAP_STATS
(now called
.Dv SWAP_OSTATS ) ,
which does not include the
.Fa se_path
member of
.Va struct swapent .
.It Cd options COMPAT_14
Enable binary compatibility with
.Nx 1.4 .
This allows some old
.Xr ioctl 2
on
.Xr wscons 4
to be performed, and allows the
.Dv NFSSVC_BIOD
mode of the
.Xr nfssvc 2
system call to be used for compatibility with the deprecated nfsiod program.
.It Cd options COMPAT_43
Enables compatibility with
.Bx 4.3 .
This adds an old syscall for
.Xr lseek 2 .
It also adds the ioctls for
.Dv TIOCGETP
and
.Dv TIOCSETP .
The return values for
.Xr getpid 2 ,
.Xr getgid 2 ,
and
.Xr getuid 2
syscalls are modified as well, to return the parent's pid and
uid as well as the current process's.
It also enables the deprecated
.Dv NTTYDISC
terminal line discipline.
It also provides backwards compatibility with
.Dq old
SIOC[GS]IF{ADDR,DSTADDR,BRDADDR,NETMASK} interface ioctls, including
binary compatibility with code written before the introduction of the
sa_len field in sockaddrs.
It also enables
support for some older pre
.Bx 4.4
socket calls.
.It Cd options COMPAT_SVR4
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with
.At V.4
applications built for the same architecture.
This currently includes the i386, m68k and sparc port.
.It Cd options COMPAT_LINUX
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with Linux ELF and
.Xr a.out 5
applications built for the same architecture.
This currently includes the alpha, i386, powerpc, and m68k
ports. There is also a minimal support for running Linux
binaries on Mips ports, but it is experimental at
the moment.
.It Cd options COMPAT_SUNOS
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with
.Tn SunOS 4.1
applications built for the same architecture.
This currently includes the sparc, sparc64 and most or all m68k ports.
Note that the sparc64 requires the
.Em COMPAT_NETBSD32
option for 64-bit kernels, in addition to this option.
.It Cd options COMPAT_ULTRIX
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with
.Tn Ultrix
applications built for the same architecture.
This currently is limited to the pmax.
The functionality of this option is unknown.
.It Cd options COMPAT_FREEBSD
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with
.Fx
applications built for the same architecture.
At the moment this is limited to the i386 port.
.It Cd options COMPAT_HPUX
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with
.Tn HP/UX
applications built for the same architecture.
This is limited to the hp300 port, and has some known bugs.
A limited set of programs do work.
.It Cd options COMPAT_IBCS2
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with iBCS2 or SVR3 applications built for the same architecture.
This is currently limited to the i386 and vax ports.
.It Cd options COMPAT_IRIX
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with IRIX o32 binaries built for the same architecture.
This feature is experimental, and it is currently limited to
the sgimips port of
.Nx .
.It Cd options COMPAT_OSF1
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with
.Tn Digital
.Ux
.Po
formerly
.Tn OSF/1
.Pc
applications built for the same architecture.
This is currently limited to the alpha port.
.It Cd options COMPAT_NOMID
Enable compatibility with
.Xr a.out 5
executables that lack a machine ID.
This includes
.Nx 0.8 Ns 's
ZMAGIC format, and 386BSD and BSDI's
QMAGIC, NMAGIC, and OMAGIC
.Xr a.out 5
formats.
.It Cd options COMPAT_NETBSD32
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with 32-bit applications built for the same architecture.
This is currently limited to the sparc64 port, and only applicable for
64-bit kernels.
.It Cd options COMPAT_SVR4_32
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with 32-bit SVR4 applications built for the same architecture.
This is currently limited to the sparc64 port, and only applicable for
64-bit kernels.
.It Cd options COMPAT_AOUT_M68K
On m68k architectures which have switched to ELF,
this enable binary compatibility with
.Nx Ns Tn /m68k
.Xr a.out 5
executables on
.Nx Ns Tn /m68k
ELF kernel.
This handles alignment incompatibility of m68k ABI between
a.out and ELF which causes the structure padding differences.
Currently only some system calls which use
.Va struct stat
are adjusted and some binaries which use
.Xr sysctl 3
to retrieve network details would not work properly.
.It Cd options EXEC_ELF_NOTELESS
Run unidentified ELF binaries as
.Nx
binaries.
This might be needed for very old
.Nx
ELF binaries on some archs.
These old binaries didn't contain an appropriate
.Li .note.netbsd.ident
section, and thus can't be identified by the kernel as
.Nx
binaries otherwise.
Beware - if this option is on, the kernel would run
.Em any
unknown ELF binaries as if they were
.Nx
binaries.
.El
.Ss Debugging Options
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd options DDB
Compiles in a kernel debugger for diagnosing kernel problems.
See
.Xr ddb 4
for details.
.Em NOTE :
not available on all architectures.
.It Cd options DDB_FROMCONSOLE=integer
If set to non-zero, DDB may be entered by sending a break on a serial
console or by a special key sequence on a graphics console.
A value of "0" ignores console breaks or key sequences,
It not explicitly specified, the default value is "1".
Note that this sets the value of the
.Em ddb.fromconsole
.Xr sysctl 3
variable which may be changed at run time -- see
.Xr sysctl 8
for details.
.It Cd options DDB_HISTORY_SIZE=integer
If this is non-zero, enable history editing in the kernel debugger
and set the size of the history to this value.
.It Cd options DDB_ONPANIC
If set to non-zero, DDB will be entered upon kernel panic.
The default if not specified is "1".
Note that this sets the value of the
.Em ddb.onpanic
.Xr sysctl 3
variable which may be changed at run time -- see
.Xr sysctl 8
for details.
.It Cd options DDB_BREAK_CHAR=integer
This option overrides the using break to enter the kernel debugger
on the serial console.
The value given will is the ascii value to be used instead.
This is currently only supported by the com driver.
.It Cd options KGDB
Compiles in a remote kernel debugger stub for diagnosing kernel problems
using the
.Dq remote target
feature of gdb.
See
.Xr gdb 1
for details.
.Em NOTE :
not available on all architectures.
.It Cd options KGDB_DEV
Device number
.Po
as a
.Dv dev_t
.Pc
of kgdb device.
.It Cd options KGDB_DEVADDR
Memory address of kgdb device.
.It Cd options KGDB_DEVMODE
Permissions of kgdb device.
.It Cd options KGDB_DEVNAME
Device name of kgdb device.
.It Cd options KGDB_DEVRATE
Baud rate of kgdb device.
.It Cd makeoptions DEBUG="-g"
The -g flag causes
.Pa netbsd.gdb
to be built in addition to
.Pa netbsd .
.Pa netbsd.gdb
is useful for debugging kernel crash dumps with gdb.
The command
.Dl gdb -k
invokes gdb in kernel debugger mode.
See
.Xr gdb 1
for details.
This also turns on
.Em options DEBUG
(which see).
.It Cd options DEBUG
Turns on miscellaneous kernel debugging.
Since options are turned into preprocessor defines (see above),
.Em options DEBUG
is equivalent to doing a
.Em #define DEBUG
throughout the kernel.
Much of the kernel has
.Em #ifdef DEBUG
conditionalized debugging code.
Note that many parts of the kernel (typically device drivers) include their own
.Em #ifdef XXX_DEBUG
conditionals instead.
This option also turns on certain other options,
which may decrease system performance.
.It Cd options DIAGNOSTIC
Adds code to the kernel that does internal consistency checks.
This code will cause the kernel to panic if corruption of internal data
structures is detected. These checks can decrease performance up to 15%.
.It Cd options KSTACK_CHECK_MAGIC
Check kernel stack usage and panic if stack overflow is detected.
This check is performance sensitive because it scans stack on each context
switch.
.It Cd options KTRACE
Add hooks for the system call tracing facility, which allows users to
watch the system call invocation behavior of processes.
See
.Xr ktrace 1
for details.
.It Cd options MSGBUFSIZE=integer
This option sets the size of the kernel message buffer.
This buffer holds the kernel output of
.Fn printf
when not (yet) read by
.Xr syslogd 8 .
This is particularly useful when the system has crashed and you wish to lookup
the kernel output from just before the crash.
Also, since the autoconfig output becomes more and more verbose,
it sometimes happens that the message buffer overflows before
.Xr syslogd 8
was able to read it.
Note that not all systems are capable of obtaining a variable sized message
buffer.
There are also some systems on which memory contents are not preserved
across reboots.
.It Cd options MALLOCLOG
Enables an event log for
.Xr malloc 9 .
Useful for tracking down
.Dq Data modified on freelist
and
.Dq multiple free
problems.
.It Cd options MALLOCLOGSIZE=integer
Defines the number of entries in the malloc log.
Default is 100000 entries.
.It Cd options SYSTRACE
Add hooks for the system call policy facility.
See
.Xr systrace 1
for details.
.It Cd options UVMHIST
Enables the UVM history logs, which create in-memory traces of
various UVM activities. These logs can be displayed be calling
.Fn uvmhist_dump
or
.Fn uvm_hist
with appropriate arguments from DDB.
See the kernel source file sys/uvm/uvm_stat.c for details.
.It Cd options UVMHIST_PRINT
Prints the UVM history logs on the system console as entries are added.
Note that the output is
.Em extremely
voluminous, so this option is really only useful for debugging
the very earliest parts of kernel initialization.
.El
.Ss File Systems
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd file-system FFS
Includes code implementing the Berkeley Fast File System
.Em ( FFS ) .
Most machines need this if they are not running diskless.
.It Cd file-system EXT2FS
Includes code implementing the Second Extended File System
.Em ( EXT2FS )
, revision 0 and revision 1 with the
.Em filetype
and
.Em sparse_super
options.  This is the most commonly used file system on the Linux operating
system, and is provided here for compatibility.
Some of the specific features of
.Em EXT2FS
like the "behavior on errors" are not implemented.
This file system can't be used with UID or GID greater than 65535.
See
.Xr mount_ext2fs 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system LFS
.Em [EXPERIMENTAL]
Include the Log-structured File System
.Em ( LFS ) .
See
.Xr mount_lfs 8
and
.Xr newfs_lfs 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system MFS
Include the Memory File System
.Em ( MFS ) .
This file system stores files in swappable memory, and produces
notable performance improvements when it is used as the file store
for
.Pa /tmp
and similar file systems.
See
.Xr mount_mfs 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system NFS
Include the client side of the Network File System
.Pq Tn NFS
remote file sharing protocol.
Although the bulk of the code implementing
.Tn NFS
is kernel based, several user level daemons are needed for it to work.
See
.Xr mount_nfs 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system CD9660
Includes code for the
.Tn ISO
9660 + Rock Ridge file system, which is the standard file system on many
.Tn CD-ROM
discs.
Useful primarily if you have a
.Tn CD-ROM
drive.
See
.Xr mount_cd9660 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system MSDOSFS
Includes the
.Tn MS-DOS
FAT file system, which is reportedly still used
by unfortunate people who have not heard about
.Nx .
Also implements the
.Tn Windows 95
extensions to the same, which permit the use of longer, mixed case
file names.
See
.Xr mount_msdos 8
and
.Xr fsck_msdos 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system NTFS
.Em [EXPERIMENTAL]
Includes code for the
.Tn Microsoft Windows NT
file system.
See
.Xr mount_ntfs 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system FDESC
Includes code for a file system, conventionally mounted on
.Pa /dev/fd ,
which permits access to the per-process file descriptor space via
special files in the file system.
See
.Xr mount_fdesc 8
for details.
Note that this facility is redundant, and thus unneeded on most
.Nx
systems, since the
.Xr fd 4
pseudodevice driver already provides identical functionality.
On most
.Nx
systems, instances of
.Xr fd 4
are mknoded under
.Pa /dev/fd/
and on
.Pa /dev/stdin ,
.Pa /dev/stdout ,
and
.Pa /dev/stderr .
.It Cd file-system KERNFS
Includes code which permits the mounting of a special file system
(normally mounted on
.Pa /kern )
in which files representing various kernel variables and parameters
may be found.
See
.Xr mount_kernfs 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system NULLFS
Includes code for a loopback file system.
This permits portions of the file hierarchy to be re-mounted in other places.
The code really exists to provide an example of a stackable file system layer.
See
.Xr mount_null 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system OVERLAY
Includes code for a file system filter.
This permits the overlay file system to intercept all access to an underlying
file system. This file system is intended to serve as an example of
a stacking file system which has a need to interpose itself between an
underlying file system and all other access.
See
.Xr mount_overlay 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system PORTAL
.Em [EXPERIMENTAL]
Includes the portal filesystem.
This permits interesting tricks like opening
.Tn TCP
sockets by opening files in the file system.
The portal file system is conventionally mounted on
.Pa /p
and is partially implemented by a special daemon.
See
.Xr mount_portal 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system PROCFS
Includes code for a special file system (conventionally mounted on
.Pa /proc )
in which the process space becomes visible in the file system.
Among
other things, the memory spaces of processes running on the system are
visible as files, and signals may be sent to processes by writing to
.Pa ctl
files in the procfs namespace.
See
.Xr mount_procfs 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system UMAPFS
Includes a loopback file system in which user and group ids may be
remapped -- this can be useful when mounting alien file systems with
different uids and gids than the local system.
See
.Xr mount_umap 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system UNION
.Em [EXPERIMENTAL]
Includes code for the union file system, which permits directories to
be mounted on top of each other in such a way that both file systems
remain visible -- this permits tricks like allowing writing (and the
deleting of files) on a read-only file system like a
.Tn CD-ROM
by mounting a local writable file system on top of the read-only file system.
See
.Xr mount_union 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system CODA
.Em [EXPERIMENTAL]
Includes code for the Coda file system.
Coda is a distributed file system like NFS and AFS.  It is
freely available, like NFS, but it functions much like AFS in being a
.Dq stateful
file system.  Both Coda and AFS cache files on your local
machine to improve performance.  Then Coda goes a step further than AFS
by letting you access the cached files when there is no available
network, viz. disconnected laptops and network outages.  In Coda, both
the client and server are outside the kernel which makes them easier
to experiment with.  Coda is available for several UNIX and non-UNIX
platforms.
See http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu for more details.
NOTE: You also need to enable the pseudo-device, vcoda, for the Coda
filesystem to work.
.El
.Ss File System Options
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd options NFSSERVER
Include the server side of the
.Em NFS
(Network File System) remote file sharing protocol.
Although the bulk of the code implementing
.Em NFS
is kernel based, several user level daemons are needed for it to
work.
See
.Xr mountd 8
and
.Xr nfsd 8
for details.
.It Cd options QUOTA
Enables kernel support for file system quotas.
See
.Xr quotaon 8 ,
.Xr edquota 8 ,
and
.Xr quota 1
for details.
Note that quotas only work on
.Dq ffs
file systems, although
.Xr rpc.rquotad 8
permits them to be accessed over
.Em NFS .
.It Cd options FFS_EI
Enable ``Endian-Independent'' FFS support.
This allows a system to mount an FFS filesystem created for another
architecture, at a small performance cost for all FFS filesystems.
See also
.Xr newfs 8 ,
.Xr fsck_ffs 8 ,
.Xr dumpfs 8
for filesystem byte order status and manipulation.
.It Cd options NVNODE=integer
This option sets the size of the cache used by the name-to-inode translation
routines, (a.k.a. the
.Fn namei
cache, though called by many other names in the kernel source).
By default, this cache has
.Dv NPROC
(set as 20 + 16 * MAXUSERS) * (80 + NPROC / 8) entries.
A reasonable way to derive a value of
.Dv NVNODE ,
should you notice a large number of namei cache misses with a tool such as
.Xr systat 1 ,
is to examine your system's current computed value with
.Xr sysctl 8 ,
(which calls this parameter "kern.maxvnodes") and to increase this value
until either the namei cache hit rate improves or it is determined that
your system does not benefit substantially from an increase in the size of
the namei cache.
.It Cd options NAMECACHE_ENTER_REVERSE
Causes the namei cache to always enter a reverse mapping (vnode -\*[Gt] name)
as well as a normal one. Normally, this is already done for directory
vnodes, to speed up the getcwd operation. This option will cause
longer hash chains in the reverse cache, and thus slow down
getcwd somewhat. However, it does make vnode -\*[Gt] path translations
possible in some cases. For now, only useful if strict /proc/#/maps
emulation for Linux binaries is required.
.It Cd options EXT2FS_SYSTEM_FLAGS
This option changes the behavior of the APPEND and IMMUTABLE flags
for a file on an
.Em EXT2FS
filesystem.
Without this option, the superuser or owner of the file can
set and clear them.
With this option, only the superuser can set them, and
they can't be cleared if the securelevel is greater than 0.
See also
.Xr chflags 1 .
.It Cd options NFS_BOOT_BOOTP
Enable use of the BOOTP protocol (RFC 951, 1048) to get configuration
information if NFS is used to mount the root file system.
See
.Xr diskless 8
for details.
.It Cd options NFS_BOOT_DHCP
Same as
.Dq NFS_BOOT_BOOTP ,
but use the DHCP extensions to the
BOOTP protocol (RFC 1541).
.It Cd options NFS_BOOT_BOOTP_REQFILE
Specifies the string sent in the bp_file field of the BOOTP / DHCP
request packet.
.It Cd options NFS_BOOT_BOOTPARAM
Enable use of the BOOTPARAM protocol, consisting of RARP and
BOOTPARAM RPC, to get configuration information if NFS
is used to mount the root file system.
See
.Xr diskless 8
for details.
.It Cd options NFS_BOOT_RWSIZE=value
Set the initial NFS read and write sizes for diskless-boot requests.
The normal default is 8Kbytes.  This option provides a way to lower
the value (e.g., to 1024 bytes) as a workaround for buggy network
interface cards or boot proms. Once booted, the read and write request
sizes can be increased by remounting the filesystem. See
.Xr mount_nfs 8
for details.
.It Cd options NFS_V2_ONLY
Reduce the size of the NFS client code by omitting code that's only required
for NFSv3 and NQNFS support, leaving only that code required to use NFSv2
servers.
.El
.Ss Miscellaneous Options
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd options LKM
Enable loadable kernel modules.
See
.Xr lkm 4
for details.
.Em NOTE :
not available on all architectures.
.It Cd options INSECURE
Hardwires the kernel security level at -1.
This means that the system
always runs in secure level 0 mode, even when running multiuser.
See the manual page for
.Xr init 8
for details on the implications of this.
The kernel secure level may manipulated by the superuser by altering the
.Em kern.securelevel
.Xr sysctl 3
variable (the secure level may only be lowered by a call from process ID 1,
i.e.
.Xr init 8 ) .
See also
.Xr sysctl 8
and
.Xr sysctl 3 .
.It Cd options UCONSOLE
Normally, only the superuser can execute the
.Dv TIOCCONS
.Xr ioctl 2 ,
which redirects console output to a non-console tty.
See
.Xr tty 4
for details.
This option permits any user to execute the
.Dv TIOCCONS
.Xr ioctl 2 .
This is useful on
machines such as personal workstations which run
.Xr X 7
servers, where one would prefer to permit console output to be
viewed in a window without requiring a suid root program to do it.
.It Cd options MEMORY_DISK_HOOKS
This option allows for some machine dependent functions to be called when
the
.Xr md 4
.Tn RAM
disk driver is configured.
This can result in automatically loading a
.Tn RAM
disk from floppy on open (among other things).
.It Cd options MEMORY_DISK_IS_ROOT
Forces the
.Xr md 4
.Tn RAM
disk to be the root device.
This can only be overridden when
the kernel is booted in the 'ask-for-root' mode.
.It Cd options MEMORY_DISK_ROOT_SIZE=integer
Allocates the given number of 512 byte blocks as memory for the
.Xr md 4
.Tn RAM
disk, to be populated with
.Xr mdsetimage 8 .
.It Cd options VNODE_OP_NOINLINE
Do not inline the VOP_*() calls in the kernel.
On i386 GENERIC, this saves 36k of kernel text.  Useful
for install media kernels, small memory systems and embedded systems.
.It Cd options HZ=integer
On ports that support it, set the system clock frequency (see
.Xr hz 9 )
to the supplied value. Handle with care.
.It Cd options NTP
Turns on in-kernel precision timekeeping support used by software
implementing
.Em NTP
(Network Time Protocol, RFC1305).
The
.Em NTP
option adds an in-kernel Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) for normal
.Em NTP
operation, and a Frequency-Locked Loop (FLL) for intermittently-connected
operation.
.Xr ntpd 8
will employ a user-level PLL when kernel support is unavailable,
but the in-kernel version has lower latency and more precision, and
so typically keeps much better time.
The interface to the kernel
.Em NTP
support is provided by the
.Xr ntp_adjtime 2
and
.Xr ntp_gettime 2
system calls, which are intended for use by
.Xr ntpd 8
and are enabled by the option.
On systems with sub-microsecond resolution timers, or where (HZ / 100000)
is not an integer, the
.Em NTP
option also enables extended-precision arithmetic to keep track of
fractional clock ticks at NTP time-format precision.
.It Cd options PPS_SYNC
This option enables a kernel serial line discipline for receiving time
phase signals from an external reference clock such as a radio clock.
(The
.Em NTP
option (which see) must be on if the
.Em PPS_SYNC
option is used.)
Some reference clocks generate a Pulse Per Second (PPS) signal in
phase with their time source.
The
.Em PPS
line discipline receives this signal on either the data leads
or the DCD control lead of a serial port.
.Em NTP
uses the PPS signal to discipline the local clock oscillator to a high
degree of precision (typically less than 50 microseconds in time and
0.1 ppm in accuracy).
.Em PPS
can also generate a serial output pulse when the system receives a PPS
interrupt.
This can be used to measure the system interrupt latency and thus calibrate
.Em NTP
to account for it.
Using
.Em PPS
usually requires a
gadget box
to convert from TTL to RS-232 signal levels.
The gadget box and PPS are described in more detail in the HTML documentation
for
.Xr ntpd 8
in
.Pa /usr/share/doc/html/ntp .
.It Cd options SETUIDSCRIPTS
Allows scripts with the setuid bit set to execute as the effective
user rather than the real user, just like binary executables.
.Pp
.Em NOTE :
Using this option will also enable
.Em options FDSCRIPTS
.It Cd option FDSCRIPTS
Allows execution of scripts with the execute bit set, but not the
read bit, by opening the file and passing the file descriptor to
the shell, rather than the filename.
.Pp
.Em NOTE :
Execute only (non-readable) scripts will have
.Va argv[0]
set to
.Pa /dev/fd/* .
What this option allows as far as security is
concerned, is the ability to safely ensure that the correct script
is run by the interpreter, as it is passed as an already open file.
.It Cd options PUCCN
Enables treating serial ports found on PCI boards
.Xr puc 4
as potential console devices.  The method for choosing such a console
device is port dependent.
.It Cd options RTC_OFFSET=integer
The kernel (and typically the hardware battery backed-up clock on
those machines that have one) keeps time in
.Em UTC
(Universal Coordinated Time, once known as
.Em GMT ,
or Greenwich Mean Time)
and not in the time of the local time zone.
The
.Em RTC_OFFSET
option is used on some ports (such as the i386) to tell the kernel
that the hardware clock is offset from
.Em UTC
by the specified number of minutes.
This is typically used when a machine boots several operating
systems and one of them wants the hardware clock to run in the
local time zone and not in
.Em UTC ,
e.g.
.Em RTC_OFFSET=300
means
the hardware clock is set to US Eastern Time (300 minutes behind
.Em UTC ) ,
and not
.Em UTC .
(Note:
.Em RTC_OFFSET
is used to initialize a kernel variable named
.Va rtc_offset
which is the source actually used to determine the clock offset, and
which may be accessed via the kern.rtc_offset sysctl variable.
See
.Xr sysctl 8
and
.Xr sysctl 3
for details.
Since the kernel clock is initialized from the hardware clock very
early in the boot process, it is not possible to meaningfully change
.Va rtc_offset
in system initialization scripts.
Changing this value currently may only be done at kernel compile
time or by patching the kernel and rebooting).
.Pp
.Em NOTE :
Unfortunately, in many cases where the hardware clock
is kept in local time, it is adjusted for Daylight Savings
Time; this means that attempting to use
.Em RTC_OFFSET
to let
.Nx
coexist with such an operating system, like Windows,
would necessitate changing
.Em RTC_OFFSET
twice a year. As such, this solution is imperfect.
.It Cd options KMEMSTATS
The kernel memory allocator,
.Xr malloc 9 ,
will keep statistics on its performance if this option is enabled.
Unfortunately, this option therefore essentially disables the
.Fn MALLOC
and
.Fn FREE
forms of the memory allocator, which are used to enhance the performance
of certain critical sections of code in the kernel.
This option therefore can lead to a significant decrease in the
performance of certain code in the kernel if enabled.
Examples of such code include the
.Fn namei
routine, the
.Xr ccd 4
driver,
the
.Xr ncr 4
driver,
and much of the networking code.
.It Cd options MAXUPRC=integer
Sets the soft
.Dv RLIMIT_NPROC
resource limit, which specifies the maximum number of simultaneous
processes a user is permitted to run, for process 0;
this value is inherited by its child processes.
It defaults to
.Em CHILD_MAX ,
which is currently defined to be 160.
Setting
.Em MAXUPRC
to a value less than
.Em CHILD_MAX
is not permitted, as this would result in a violation of the semantics of
.St -p1003.1-90 .
.It Cd options DEFCORENAME=string
Sets the default value of the

.It Cd options RASOPS_SMALL
Removes optimized character writing code from the

.It Cd options INCLUDE_CONFIG_FILE
Embeds the kernel config file used to define the kernel in the kernel
binary itself.  The embedded data also includes any files directly
included by the config file itself, e.g.
.Pa GENERIC.local
or
.Pa std.$MACHINE .
The embedded config file can be extracted from the resulting kernel by
the following command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent

.It Cd options INCLUDE_JUST_CONFIG
Similar to the above option, but includes just the actual config file,
not any included files.
.It Cd options PIPE_SOCKETPAIR
Use slower, but smaller socketpair(2)-based pipe implementation instead
of default faster, but bigger one. Primarily useful for installation
kernels.

.It Cd options GATEWAY
Enables
.Em IPFORWARDING
(which see)
and (on most ports) increases the size of
.Em NMBCLUSTERS
(which see).
In general,
.Em GATEWAY
is used to indicate that a system should act as a router, and
.Em IPFORWARDING
is not invoked directly.
(Note that
.Em GATEWAY
has no impact on protocols other than
.Tn IP ,
such as
.Tn CLNP
or
.Tn XNS ) .
.Em GATEWAY
option also compiles IPv4 fast forwarding code into the kernel.
.It Cd options IPFORWARDING=value
If
.Em value
is 1 this enables IP routing behavior. If
.Em value
is 0 (the default), it disables it. The
.Em GATEWAY
option sets this to 1 automatically.
With this option enabled, the machine will forward IP datagrams destined
for other machines between its interfaces.
Note that even without this option, the kernel will
still forward some packets (such as source routed packets) -- removing
.Em GATEWAY
and
.Em IPFORWARDING
is insufficient to stop all routing through a bastion host on a
firewall -- source routing is controlled independently.
To turn off source routing, use
.Em options IPFORWSRCRT=0
(which see).
Note that IP forwarding may be turned on and off independently of the
setting of the
.Em IPFORWARDING
option through the use of the
.Em net.inet.ip.forwarding
sysctl variable.
If
.Em net.inet.ip.forwarding
is 1, IP forwarding is on.
See
.Xr sysctl 8
and
.Xr sysctl 3
for details.
.It Cd options IPFORWSRCRT=value
If
.Em value
is set to zero, source routing of IP datagrams is turned off.
If
.Em value
is set to one (the default) or the option is absent, source routed IP
datagrams are forwarded by the machine.
Note that source routing of IP packets may be turned on and off
independently of the setting of the
.Em IPFORWSRCRT
option through the use of the
.Em net.inet.ip.forwsrcrt
sysctl variable.
If
.Em net.inet.ip.forwsrcrt
is 1, forwarding of source routed IP datagrams is on.
See
.Xr sysctl 8
and
.Xr sysctl 3
for details.
.It Cd options IFA_STATS
Tells the kernel to maintain per-address statistics on bytes sent
and received over (currently) internet and appletalk addresses.
.\"This can be a fairly expensive operation, so you probably want to
.\"keep this disabled.
The option is not recommended as it degrades system stability.
.It Cd options MROUTING

Kernel binary will not be subject to export control in most of countries,
even if compiled with

For example, it should be okay to export it from within the United States
to the outside.
.Em INET6
and
.Em IPSEC
are orthogonal so you can get IPv4-only kernel with IPsec support,
IPv4/v6 dual support kernel without IPsec, and so forth.
This option requires
.Em INET
at this moment, but it should not.
.It Cd options IPSEC_DEBUG
Enables debugging code in

.Em IPSEC .
.It Cd options IPSEC_ESP
Includes support for

.Em IPSEC_ESP
will enable source code that is subject to export control in some countries
.Pq including the United States ,
and compiled kernel binary will be subject to certain restriction.
This option assumes
.Em IPSEC .
.It Cd options SUBNETSARELOCAL
Sets default value for net.inet.ip.subnetsarelocal variable, which
controls whether non-directly-connected subnets of connected networks
are considered "local" for purposes of choosing the MSS for a TCP
connection.  This is mostly present for historic reasons and
completely irrelevant if you enable Path MTU discovery.
.It Cd options HOSTZEROBROADCAST
Sets default value for net.inet.ip.hostzerobroadcast variable, which
controls whether the zeroth host address of each connected subnet is
also considered a broadcast address.  Default value is "1", for
compatibility with old systems; if this is set to zero on all hosts on
a subnet, you should be able to fit an extra host per subnet on the
".0" address.
.It Cd options MCLSHIFT=value
This option is the base-2 logarithm of the size of mbuf clusters.
The
.Bx
networking stack keeps network packets in a linked
list, or chain, of kernel buffer objects called mbufs.
The system provides larger mbuf clusters as an optimization for
large packets, instead of using long chains for large packets.
The mbuf cluster size,
or
.Em MCLBYTES ,
must be a power of two, and is computed as two raised to the power
.Em MCLSHIFT .
On systems with Ethernet network adaptors,
.Em MCLSHIFT
is often set to 11, giving 2048-byte mbuf clusters, large enough to
hold a 1500-byte
.Tn Ethernet
frame in a single cluster.
Systems with network interfaces supporting larger frame sizes like
.Tn ATM ,
.Tn FDDI ,
or
.Tn HIPPI
may perform better with
.Em MCLSHIFT
set to 12 or 13, giving mbuf cluster sizes of 4096 and 8192 bytes,
respectively.

The state of this code is currently unknown, and probably contains bugs.
This option assumes

.It Cd options NETATALK
Include support for the
.Tn AppleTalk

The kernel provides provision for the
.Em Datagram Delivery Protocol
(DDP), providing SOCK_DGRAM support and
.Tn AppleTalk
routing.
This stack is used by the
.Em NETATALK
package, which adds support for
.Tn AppleTalk
server services via user libraries and applications.
.It Cd options IPNOPRIVPORTS
Normally, only root can bind a socket descriptor to a so-called
.Dq privileged
.Tn TCP
port, that is, a port number in the range 0-1023.
This option eliminates those checks from the kernel.
This can be useful if there is a desire to allow daemons without
privileges to bind those ports, e.g. on firewalls.
The security tradeoffs in doing this are subtle.
This option should only be used by experts.
.It Cd options TCP_COMPAT_42
.Tn TCP
bug compatibility with
.Bx 4.2 .
In
.Bx 4.2 ,
.Tn TCP
sequence numbers were 32-bit signed values.
Modern implementations of TCP use unsigned values.
This option clamps the initial sequence number to start in
the range 2^31 rather than the full unsigned range of 2^32.
Also, under
.Bx 4.2 ,
keepalive packets must contain at least one byte or else
the remote end would not respond.
.It Cd options TCP_DEBUG

.Em kmem_map ,
in PAGE_SIZE-sized chunks (the VM page size; this value may be read
from the
.Xr sysctl 8

.Em hw.pagesize
).
This VM map is used to map the kernel malloc arena.
The kernel attempts to auto-size this map based on the amount of

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
man page first appeared in
.Nx 1.3 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Em INET
and the
.Em VNODEPAGER
options should not be required.
The
.Em EON
option should be a pseudo-device, and is also very fragile.
