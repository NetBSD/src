.Dt BIO 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm bio
.Nd Block IO ioctl tunnel pseudo-device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device bio"
.Pp
.In dev/biovar.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides userland applications
.Xr ioctl 2
access to devices otherwise not found as
.Pa /dev
nodes.
The
.Pa /dev/bio
device node operates by delegating ioctl
calls to a requested device driver.
Only drivers which have registered with the
.Nm
device can be accessed via this interface.
.Pp
The following device drivers register with
.Nm
for volume management:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ataraid(4)XX -offset indent -compact
.\" .It Xr ami 4
.\" American Megatrends Inc. MegaRAID PATA/SATA/SCSI RAID controller
.It Xr arcmsr 4
Areca Technology Corporation SATA RAID controller
.It Xr ataraid 4

.It Xr cac 4

.El
.Pp
The following ioctl calls apply to the
.Nm bio
device:
.Bl -tag -width BIOCCAPABILITIES
.It Dv BIOCLOCATE
Locate a named device and give back a cookie to the application
for subsequent ioctl calls.
The cookie is used to tunnel further ioctls to the right device.
.It Dv BIOCINQ
Retrieve number of volumes and physical disks for a specific device.
.It Dv BIOCDISK
Retrieve detailed information for the specified physical disk.
Information returned can include status, size, channel, target, lun,
vendor name, serial number, and processor device (ses).
.\" or safte
.It Dv BIOCDISK_NOVOL
Is just the same as
.Dv BIOCDISK
but doesn't require the disks to be in volume sets, so this
applies to any physical disk connected to the controller.
.Pp
Note: this ioctl might not be supported on all hardware.
It is a
.Nx
extension of
.Nm .
It is supported by
.Xr arcmsr 4 ,
.Xr ciss 4 ,
and
.Xr mpt 4 .
It is also supported by
.Xr cac 4 ,
but handled exactly the same as
.Dv BIOCDISK .
.It Dv BIOCVOL
Retrieve detailed information for the specified volume.
Information returned can include status, size, RAID level, number of disks,
device name association (sd?) and vendor name.
.It Dv BIOCALARM
Control the alarm beeper on the device.
Supported states are: disable alarm, enable alarm, silence alarm, status and
test alarm.
.Pp
Note: These options might not be supported on all hardware.
It is supported by
.Xr arcmsr 4 ,
.Xr mfi 4 ,
and
.Xr mfii 4 .
.It Dv BIOCBLINK
Blink an LED of the specified physical disk.
Supported blink states are: blink LED, unblink LED and blink alarm LED.
.Pp
Note: This option is only supported if the disk is governed by
.Xr ses 4
.\" or
.\" .Xr safte 4
and the hardware supports hardware blinking.
It is supported by
.Xr ciss 4 ,
.Xr mfi 4 ,
and
.Xr mfii 4 .
.It Dv BIOCSETSTATE
Alter the state of specified physical disk.
Supported states are: create/remove hot-spare, create/remove pass through
disk, start/stop consistency check in a volume, online disk and offline disk,
and a manual rebuild kick-off designation.
.Pp
Note: These options might not be supported on all hardware.
Some of these options are supported by
.Xr arcmsr 4 ,
.Xr mfi 4 ,
and
.Xr mfii 4 .
.Pp
Online, offline and hotspare designations are supported by
.Xr mfi 4
and
.Xr mfii 4 ,
plus a rebuild designation is supported by
.Xr mfii 4 ;
all four of these state options are the original states from
.Ox ,
the other options, including hotspare unmarking, being
.Nx
extensions of
.Nm .
.Pp
Hotspare, pass through and consistency check options are supported by
.Xr arcmsr 4 .
.It Dv BIOCVOLOPS
For operations in volume sets.
It's able to create and remove a volume
set in a supported RAID controller.
.Pp
Note: this ioctl might not be supported on all hardware.
It is a
.Nx
extension of
.Nm ,
and is supported by
.Xr arcmsr 4 .
.El
.Pp
The
.Xr bioctl 8
utility can be used to perform the above controls from the userland.
Additionally, since
.Dv BIOCVOL
volume status is normally duplicated into
.Xr sysmon_envsys 9
sensors of
.Dv ENVSYS_DRIVE
type, it is also available through
.Xr envsys 4 ,
and can be monitored with
.Xr envstat 8
and
.Xr powerd 8 .
