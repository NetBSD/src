.Sh NAME
.Nm wm
.Nd Intel i8254x Gigabit Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "wm* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Pp
Configuration of PHYs may also be necessary.  See
.Xr mii 4 .
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports Gigabit Ethernet interfaces based on the Intel
i8254x family of Gigabit Ethernet chips.  The interfaces supported by
the
.Nm
driver include:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Intel i82542 1000BASE-X Ethernet
.It
Intel i82543GC 1000BASE-X Ethernet
.It
Intel i82543GC 1000BASE-T Ethernet
.It
Intel i82544EI 1000BASE-T Ethernet
.It
Intel i82544EI 1000BASE-X Ethernet
.It
Intel i82544GC 1000BASE-T Ethernet
.It
Intel i82544GC (LOM) 1000BASE-T Ethernet
.It
Intel i82540EM 1000BASE-T Ethernet
.It
Intel i82540EP 1000BASE-T Ethernet
.It
Intel i82545EM 1000BASE-T Ethernet
.It
Intel i82546EB 1000BASE-T Ethernet
.Pq dual-port
.It
Intel i82545EM 1000BASE-X Ethernet
.It
Intel i82546EB 1000BASE-X Ethernet
.Pq dual-port
.It
Intel i82540EM (LOM) 1000BASE-T Ethernet
.El
.Pp
In addition to Intel's own
.Dq PRO/1000
line of Gigabit Ethernet interfaces, these chips also appear on
some server systems, processor evaluation boards, and in embedded
systems.
.Pp
The i8254x supports IPv4/TCP/UDP checksumming in hardware.  The
.Nm
driver supports this feature of the chip.  See
.Xr ifconfig 8
for information on how to enable this feature.
