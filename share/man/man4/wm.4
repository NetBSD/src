.El
.Pp
In addition to Intel's own
.Dq PRO/1000
line of Gigabit Ethernet interfaces, these chips also appear on
some server systems, processor evaluation boards, and in embedded
systems.
.Pp
The i825[478]x supports IPv4/TCP/UDP checksumming and TCP segmentation
in hardware.
The
.Nm
driver supports these features of the chip.
See
.Xr ifconfig 8
for information on how to enable this feature.
.Pp
Many chips supported by the
.Nm
driver support jumbo frames, however several chips do not support
jumbo frames, e.g. i82542, i82081H and 82567V.
Jumbo frames can be configured via the interface MTU setting.
Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the
.Xr ifconfig 8
utility configures the adapter to receive and transmit jumbo frames.
.\" .Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.\" XXX to be done.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width WM_RX_INTR_PROCESS_LIMIT_DEFAULT -offset 3n
.It Dv WM_RX_PROCESS_LIMIT_DEFAULT
The maximum number of received packets processed in each
.Xr softint 9
context.
This option only affects multiqueue.
The value range is from zero to
.Dv UINT_MAX .
The default value is 100.
When you increase this value, both the receive latency and
the receive throughput will increase.
.It Dv WM_TX_PROCESS_LIMIT_DEFAULT
Transmit side of
.Dv WM_RX_PROCESS_LIMIT_DEFAULT .
.It Dv WM_RX_INTR_PROCESS_LIMIT_DEFAULT
The maximum number of received packets processed in each
hardware interrupt context.
This option only affects multiqueue.
The value range is from zero to
.Dv UINT_MAX .
The default value is 0.
When you increase this value, both the receive latency and
the receive throughput will decrease.
.It Dv WM_TX_INTR_PROCESS_LIMIT_DEFAULT
Transmit side of
.Dv WM_RX_INTR_PROCESS_LIMIT_DEFAULT .
.It Dv WM_EVENT_COUNTERS
Enable many event counters such as each Tx drop counter and Rx interrupt
counter.
Caution: If this flag is enabled, the number of evcnt entries increase
very much.
.It Dv WM_DISABLE_MSI
If this option is set non-zero value, this driver does not use msi.
The default value is 0.
.It Dv WM_DISABLE_MSIX
If this option is set non-zero value, this driver does not use msix.
The default value is 0.
.El
.Pp
Setting
.Dv WM_RX_INTR_PROCESS_LIMIT_DEFAULT
to zero means so-called polling mode, that is, once an interrupt occurs,
the driver keep processing received packets until
.Dv WM_RX_PROCESS_LIMIT_DEFAULT .
Polling mode increases latency a little, however it suppresses
performance degradation at high load very well.
.Pp
If you want to disable polling mode (to use traditional interrupt
driven mode), you should set
.Dv WM_RX_PROCESS_LIMIT_DEFAULT
to zero and set
.Dv WM_RX_INTR_PROCESS_LIMIT_DEFAULT
to
.Dv UINT_MAX .
