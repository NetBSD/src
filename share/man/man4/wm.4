In addition to Intel's own
.Dq PRO/1000
line of Gigabit Ethernet interfaces, these chips also appear on
some server systems, processor evaluation boards, and in embedded
systems.
.Pp
The i8254x supports IPv4/TCP/UDP checksumming and TCP segmentation
in hardware.
The
.Nm
driver supports these features of the chip.
See
.Xr ifconfig 8
for information on how to enable this feature.
