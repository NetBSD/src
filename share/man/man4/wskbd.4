.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver handles common tasks for keyboards within the
.Xr wscons 4
framework.
It is attached to the hardware specific keyboard drivers and
provides their connection to
.Dq wsdisplay
devices and a character device interface.
.Pp
The common keyboard support consists of:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Mapping from keycodes (defined by the specific keyboard driver) to
keysyms (hardware independent, defined in
.Pa /usr/include/dev/wscons/wsksymdef.h ) .
.It
Handling of
.Dq compose
sequences.
Characters commonly not present as separate key on keyboards
can be generated after either a special
.Dq compose
key is pressed or a
.Dq dead accent
character is used.
.It
Certain translations, like turning an
.Dq ALT
modifier into an
.Dq ESC
prefix.
.It
Automatic key repetition
.Pq Dq typematic .
.It
Parameter handling for
.Dq keyboard bells .
.It
Generation of
.Dq keyboard events
for use by X servers.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides a number of ioctl functions to control key maps
and other parameters.
These functions are accessible though the associated
.Dq wsdisplay
device as well.
A complete list is in
.Pa /usr/include/dev/wscons/wsconsio.h .
The
.Xr wsconsctl 8
utility allows to access key maps and other variables.
.Pp
The
.Em console
locator in the configuration line refers to the device's use as input
part of the operating system console.
A device specification containing a positive value here will only
match if the device is in use as system console.
(The console device selection in early system startup is not influenced.)
This way, the console device can be connected to a known
wskbd device instance.
.Ss Keyboard encodings
The following encodings are supported.
Device drivers for legacy keyboard interfaces may only support a subset
of these.
However, generally, all encodings are supported by
.Xr pckbd 4
and
.Xr ukbd 4 .

.El
.Pp
.Li KB_NODEAD (
.Dq .nodead )
can be applied to layouts with
.Dq dead accents
to switch them off.
.Pp
The
.Li KB_US ,
.Li KB_UK ,
.Li KB_FR ,
.Li KB_JP
and
.Li KB_US|KB_DVORAK
mappings can be modified
to swap the left CTRL and the CAPS LOCK keys by the
.Li KB_SWAPCTRLCAPS
variant bit or the
.Dq .swapctrlcaps
suffix.
.Pp
The
.Li KB_METAESC (
.Dq .metaesc )
option can be applied to any layout.
If set, keys pressed together
with the ALT modifier are prefixed by an ESC character.
(Standard behaviour is to add 128 to the ASCII value.)
.Ss Ioctls
The following
.Xr ioctl 2
calls are provided by the
.Nm
driver or by devices which use it.
Their definitions are found in
.Pa dev/wscons/wsconsio.h .
.Bl -tag -width Dv
.It Dv WSKBDIO_GTYPE
Get the keyboard type.
.It Dv WSKBDIO_COMPLEXBELL, WSKBDIO_SETBELL, WSKBDIO_GETBELL, WSKBDIO_SETDEFAULTBELL, WSKBDIO_GETDEFAULTBELL Pq Li "struct wsmouse_repeat"
Get and set keyboard bell settings.
.It Dv WSKBDIO_SETKEYREPEAT, WSKBDIO_GETKEYREPEAT, WSKBDIO_SETDEFAULTKEYREPEAT, WSKBDIO_GETDEFAULTKEYREPEAT Pq Li "struct wskbd_keyrepeat_data"
Get and set keyboard autorepeat settings.
.It Dv WSKBDIO_SETLEDS, WSKBDIO_GETLEDS Pq Li "int"
Get and set keyboard LED settings.
.It Dv WSKBDIO_GETMAP, WSKBDIO_SETMAP Pq Li "struct wskbd_map_data"
Get and set keyboard keymapping settings.
.It Dv WSKBDIO_GETENCODING, WSKBDIO_SETENCODING Pq Li "kbd_t"
Get and set keyboard encoding settings.
.It Dv WSKBDIO_GETKEYCLICK, WSKBDIO_SETKEYCLICK Pq Li "int"
Get and set keyboard keyclick settings.
.It Dv WSKBDIO_SETVERSION Pq Li "int"
Set the wscons_event protocol version.
The default is 0 for binary compatibility.
The latest version is
always available as
.Dv WSKBD_EVENT_VERSION ,
and is currently 1.
All new code should use a call similar to the below to ensure the
correct version is returned.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
int ver = WSKBD_EVENT_VERSION;
if (ioctl(fd, WSKBDIO_SETVERSION, &ver) == -1)
    err(EXIT_FAILURE, "cannot set version");

The list of builtin mappings doesn't follow any logic.
It grew as people submitted what they needed.
