.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB
.Tn Ethernet
adapters based on the ADMtek AN986 Pegasus and AN8511 Pegasus II chipsets.
.Pp
The Pegasus contains a 10/100
.Tn Ethernet
MAC with MII interface and is designed to work with both
.Tn Ethernet
and HomePNA transceivers.
Although designed to interface with 100Mbps peripherals, the existing
USB standard specifies a maximum transfer speed of 12Mbps.
Users should therefore not expect to actually
achieve 100Mbps speeds with these devices.
.Pp
The Pegasus supports a 64-bit multicast hash table, single perfect
filter entry for the station address and promiscuous mode.
Packets are
received and transmitted over separate USB bulk transfer endpoints.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It autoselect
Enable automatic selection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override the automatically selected mode by
adding media options to the
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
file.
.It 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to enable
.Ar full-duplex
operation.
Not specifying
.Ar full duplex
implies
.Ar half-duplex
mode.
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (fast
.Tn Ethernet )
operation.
The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to enable
.Ar full-duplex
operation.
Not specifying
.Ar full duplex
implies
.Ar half-duplex
mode.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
The interface will operate in half duplex mode
if this media option is not specified.
.El
