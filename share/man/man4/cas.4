.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.1 .
.Nx
support was added in
.Nx 6.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written for
.Ox
by
.An Mark Kettenis
.Aq kettenis@openbsd.org ,
based on the
.Xr gem 4
driver, and ported to
.Nx
by
.An Julian Coleman
.Aq jdc@NetBSD.org .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver does not support any of the advanced features of the Cassini chip.
.Pp
On the SX fibre variants of the hardware, the link may stay down if media
options apart from
.Dv autoselect
are chosen.
