.Sh NAME
.Nm isp
.Nd Qlogic based SCSI and FibreChannel SCSI Host Adapters
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "isp* at pci? dev? function?" Pq PCI
.Cd "isp* at sbus? slot ? offset ?" Pq SBus
.Cd scsibus* at isp?
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to SCSI or FibreChannel devices.
.Pp
SCSI features include support for Ultra SCSI and wide mode transactions for
SCSI, and LVD (for the ISP1080 and ISP1280),
.Pp
Fibre Channel support uses FCP SCSI profile for
FibreChannel and uses Class 3 connections only.
Support is available for Public and Private loops.
Command tagging is supported for all (in fact,
FibreChannel requires tagging).
.Sh CONFIGURATION
An optional
.Cd flags 0x80
appended to the above
.Nm
declarations will disable the download of driver firmware, which means you
use whatever firmware is running on the card.
If no firmware is running on the card,
the driver cannot operate the card.
.Pp
An optional
.Cd flags 0x40
appended to the above
.Nm
declarations (can be OR'd in with the other config flags option)
will keep the driver from looking at device or bus NVRAM settings (this
is in case NVRAM is just wrong and you have the card in a platform where
it is inconvenient to change NVRAM settings on the card).
.Sh HARDWARE
Supported cards include:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxx -offset indent

.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Matthew Jacob
for NASA/Ames Research Center.
.Sh BUGS
The driver currently ignores some NVRAM settings.
.Pp
The driver currently doesn't do error recovery for timed out commands
very gracefully.
.Pp
Sometimes, when booting, the driver gets stuck waiting for the Fibre Channel
firmware to tell it that the loop port database is ready.
In this case you'll see an announcement that the loop state has a
value of 0x1.
To unwedge the system, unplug and replug the fibre channel connection,
or otherwise cause a LIP (Loop Initialization Primitive sequence) -
this will kick the firmware into getting unstuck.
