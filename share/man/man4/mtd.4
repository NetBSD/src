.Sh BUGS
This driver has not been tested on any architecture besides i386.
It does not handle DMA cache flushes at all, so it will very likely
not work on other architectures that require this.
.Pp
Power management is missing.
.Pp
A CardBus variant is rumored to exist, but support for it has not been
added to the driver yet.
