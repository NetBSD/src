.Sh NAME
.Nm xge
.Nd Neterion Xframe-I Ten Gigabit Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "xge* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports the Neterion Xframe-I LR Ethernet adapter,
which uses a single mode fiber (1310nm) interface.
.Pp
The Xframe supports IPv4/TCP/UDP checksumming in hardware, as well
as TCP Segmentation Offloading (TSO) and hardware VLAN handling.
The driver currently does not support the hardware VLAN feature.
See
.Xr ifconfig 8
for information on how to enable TSO and hardware checksum calculation.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It xge%s: failed configuring endian, %llx != %llx!
The Xframe could not be turned into the correct endian operation.
This is most likely a hardware error.
.Pp
.It xge%d: failed allocating txmem.
.It xge%d: failed allocating rxmem.
The computer has run out of kernel memory.
.Pp
.It xge%d: adapter not quiescent, aborting
.It xge%d: ADAPTER_STATUS missing bits %s
The Xframe could not be turned into a usable state.
Most likely an Xframe hardware error.
.Pp
.It xge%d: cannot create TX DMA maps
.It xge%d: cannot create RX DMA maps
This error is either a kernel error or that the kernel has run out
of available memory.
.Pp
.It xge%d: bad compiler struct alignment, %d != %d
The compiler did not align the structure correctly.
This is a compiler problem.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Nx 3.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Anders Magnusson Aq Mt ragge@ludd.luth.se .
.Sh BUGS
There should be an XGMII framework for the driver to use.
