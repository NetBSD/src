.Sh NAME
.Nm ums
.Nd USB mouse and touchpanel support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ums*     at uhidev? reportid ?"
.Cd "wsmouse* at ums?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB mice and touchpanels.
Access to the movement data is through the
.Xr wsmouse 4
driver.
.Pp
Be aware that many USB mice will, if the mouse device is not open,
detach and reattach themselves repeatedly at regular intervals
(usually around one minute) causing spam on the console and the system
log.
This is apparently intentional behavior on the part of the hardware
manufacturers.
The best workaround is to keep the mouse device open, either via 
X11, or, if not using the window system, by running
.Xr wsmoused 8 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr uhidev 4 ,
.Xr usb 4 ,
.Xr wsmouse 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver
appeared in
.Nx 1.4 .
Touchpanel support was added in
.Nx 5.1 .
