.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB
.Tn Ethernet
adapters based on the ASIX Electronics AX88172, AX88178, AX88772, AX88772A,
AX88772B USB 2.0 chipsets.
.Pp
The chip contains a 10/100
.Tn Ethernet
MAC with MII interface and is designed to work with both
.Tn Ethernet
and HomePNA transceivers.
The AX8172 and AX88772 contain 10/100 Ethernet MACs with MII interfaces.
The AX8178 contains a 10/100/1000 Gigabit
.Tn Ethernet
MAC with a GMII/MII interface.
The chip also supports USB 2.0, thereby accommodating 100 Mb/s data rates.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It autoselect
Enable automatic selection of the media type and options.
.It 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to enable
.Ar full-duplex
operation.
Not specifying
.Ar full duplex
implies
.Ar half-duplex
mode.
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (fast
.Tn Ethernet )
operation.
The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to enable
.Ar full-duplex
operation.
Not specifying
.Ar full duplex
implies
.Ar half-duplex
mode.
.It 1000baseT
Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit
.Tn Ethernet )
operation (AX88178 only).
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
The interface will operate in half duplex mode
if this media option is not specified.
