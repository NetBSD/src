.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides
.Tn TTY
support for
.Tn Zilog
8530 Dual
.Tn UART
chips.
.Pp
Input and output for each line may set to any baud rate in the
range 50 to 38400 (and higher on some machines).
.Pp
The
.Em PPS_SYNC
option enables code to use the Data Carrier Detect (DCD) signal line for attachment
to an external precision clock source
.Po
e.g.,
.Tn GPS ,
.Tn CDMA
.Pc
which generates a Pulse Per Second (PPS) signal.
This is used by
.Xr ntpd 8
to discipline the system clock, and more accurately count/measure time.
See
.Xr options 4
for more discussion.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It zs0*: fifo overflow
.br
The on-chip
.Dq FIFO
has overflowed and incoming data has been lost.
This generally means the machine is not responding to
interrupts from the ZS chip fast enough, which can be
remedied only by using a lower baud rate.
.It zs0*: ring overflow
.br
The software input
.Qq ring
has overflowed.
This usually means input flow-control is not configured correctly
.Pq i.e. incorrect cable wiring .

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver was derived from the
.Nm sparc
.Nm zs
driver supplied with
.Bx 4.4
.Ux .
.Sh CAVEATS
.Pa /dev/ttyB1
on alpha is created by
.Xr MAKEDEV 8
with minor number 2, so the corresponding device should be zstty2, not zstty1.
.Sh BUGS
The old
.Tn Zilog
8530 chip has a very small FIFO (3 bytes?) and
therefore has very strict latency requirements for the
interrupt service routine.
This limits the usable baud rates on many machines.
