.Sh NAME
.Nm ec
.Nd 3Com 3c400 Multibus Ethernet interface driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ec0 at mbmem0 addr 0xe0000 ipl 3"
.Cd "ec1 at mbmem0 addr 0xe2000 ipl 3"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to the 10 Mb/s
.Tn Ethernet
network via the
.Tn 3Com
3c400 Ethernet chip set.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the Address Resolution Protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and
.Tn Ethernet
addresses on the local network.
