.Dt AUTOCONF 4 sun2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm autoconf
.Nd diagnostics from the autoconfiguration code
.Sh DESCRIPTION
When
.Nx
bootstraps it probes the innards of the machine
on which it is running
and locates controllers, drives, and other devices, printing out
what it finds on the console.  This procedure is driven by a system
configuration table which is processed by
.Xr config 1
and compiled into each kernel.
Devices which exist in the machine but are not configured into the
kernel are not detected.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It CPU class not configured.
You tried to boot
.Nx
on a class of
.Tn CPU
type which it doesn't
(or at least this compiled version of
.Nx
doesn't) understand.
