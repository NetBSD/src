.Sh NAME
.Nm ie
.Nd Intel 82586 Ethernet interface driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ie0 at obio0 addr 0x7f0800 ipl 3"
.Cd "ie0 at mbmem0 addr 0x88000 ipl 3"
.Cd "ie1 at mbmem0 addr 0x8c000 ipl 3"
.Cd "ie1 at vme0 addr 0xe88000,0xe00000 len -1,0x40000 irq 3 vect 0x75"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to the 10 Mb/s
.Tn Ethernet
network via the
.Tn Intel
82586 Ethernet chip set.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the Address Resolution Protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and
.Tn Ethernet
addresses on the local network.
