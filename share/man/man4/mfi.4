.Pp
These controllers support RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5, RAID 6, RAID 10, RAID 50 and
RAID 60 using either SAS or SATA II drives.
.Pp
Although the controllers are actual RAID controllers,
the driver makes them look just like SCSI controllers.
All RAID configuration is done through the controllers' BIOSes.
.Pp
.Nm
supports monitoring of the logical disks in the controller through the
.Xr bioctl 8
and
.Xr envstat 8
commands.
.Sh EVENTS
The
.Nm
driver is able to send events to
.Xr powerd 8
if a logical drive in the controller is not online.
The
.Em state-changed
event will be sent to the
.Pa /etc/powerd/scripts/sensor_drive
script when such condition happens.
