.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the
.Tn NCR
53C90, 53C94 and 53C96;
.Tn Emulex
ESP100, ESP100A, ESP200 and ESP406; and
.Tn Qlogic
FAS216 and FAS408
.Tn SCSI
controller chips found in a wide variety of systems and peripheral boards.
This includes the
.Tn Qlogic
.Tn ISA
and
.Tn VLB
.Tn SCSI
host adapters, and the
.Tn Sun
Fast
.Tn SCSI
buffered
.Tn Ethernet
for
.Tn Sbus
.Pq FSBE/S, X1053A, Sun part # 501-2015 .
.Pp
For
.Tn Qlogic
.Tn PCI
.Tn SCSI
host adapters, use the
.Xr isp 4
device.
.Sh CONFIGURATION
The
.Nm
driver supports the following
.Sy flags
for use in
.Xr config 1
files:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width "bits 16-23:"
.It bits 0-7 :
disable disconnect/reselect for the corresponding
.Tn SCSI
target
.It bits 8-15 :
disable synchronous negotiation for the corresponding
.Tn SCSI
target
.It bits 16-23 :
disable tagged queuing for the corresponding
.Tn SCSI
target
.El
.Pp
.Qq Target
is synonymous with
.Tn SCSI
ID number.
.Pp
Note that
.Tn SCSI
tape drives should be allowed to perform disconnect/reselect or performance
will suffer.
