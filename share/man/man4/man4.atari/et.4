.Nd driver for ET4000 VME graphics cards
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "et0 at vme0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports VME graphics cards based on the Tseng ET4000 chipset.
It supports the minimal ioctl's needed to run X11.  The 8Kb control registers
are mapped from offset 0x0 to offset 0x1fff and the 1MB frame buffer is mapped
from offset 0x400000 to offset 0x4fffff.  VGA compatible memory is mapped from
offset 0xa0000 to offset 0xc0000.
.Sh HARDWARE
Cards supported by the
.Nm
driver include:
.Pp
.Bl -item -compact
.It
Crazy Dots II VME graphics card
.El
.Sh NOTES
The clock generator on the Crazy Dots card is an ICS 1394M.  Setting the
clock is done by writing to a register at offset 0x0.  This address cannot
be read.  The values that can be written to the register and the associated
clock are:
