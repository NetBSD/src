.Sh NAME
.Nm rtc
.Nd Atari Real Time Clock
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "clock0 at mainbus0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports reading from and writing to the Atari real time clock (RTC).
When reading from the RTC, the format string of the output, as described in
the
.Xr strftime 3
manual page, is:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
``%Y%m%d%H%M.%S''
.Ed
.Pp
The same format is used to set the RTC to the current date.  Note that the
kernel expects the RTC to run in UTC.
