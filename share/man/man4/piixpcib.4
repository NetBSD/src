.Sh NAME
.Nm piixpcib
.Nd Intel PIIX4 PCI-ISA bridge with SpeedStep
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "piixpcib* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "isa* at piixpcib?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Intel PIIX and compatible PCI-ISA Bridges
with Intel's first generation SpeedStep.
.Pp
Frequency scaling is supported on Pentium III with two voltage modes,
used by SpeedStep as power states low and high.
The driver will switch into low power state by reducing voltage
and frequency of the CPU.
The factor depends on the processor itself, but
will always reduce power consumption about 1/2.
.Pp
The user can manually control the CPU frequency with the
.Xr sysctl 8
program using the following node:
.Bl -tag -width usscanner -offset indent
.It machdep.speedstep_state = [0/1]
.El

.Nm
driver first appeared in
