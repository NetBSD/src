.Nd Alternative memory disk driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "altmem* at altmemdev?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION

.Pp
When an alternative memory disk device is present, this device is generally
preferred to hard disk-based swap space.
See the
.Xr swapctl 8
and
.Xr fstab 5
man pages for instructions on how to assign priorities to swap devices.
