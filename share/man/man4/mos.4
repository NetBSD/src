.Sh NAME
.Nm mos
.Nd MosChip MCS7730/7830/7832 10/100 USB Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "mos*   at uhub?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB Ethernet adapters based on the MosChip
MCS7730, MCS7830, and MCS7832 USB 2.0 chipsets, including the
following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Delock 61147
.It Sitecom LN-030
.It Syba SY-U2LAN
.El
.Pp
All adapters operate with either USB 1.x, 2.0, or 3.x controllers,
though performance with 1.x controllers is limited since
the USB 1.x standard specifies a maximum transfer speed of 12Mbps.
Users with USB 1.x controllers should therefore not expect to actually
achieve 100Mbps speeds with these devices.
.Pp
A 64-bit multicast hash table is supported,
single perfect filter entry for the station address,
all-multicast mode, and promiscuous mode.
Packets are
received and transmitted over separate USB bulk transfer endpoints.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width "autoselect"
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options (this is the default).
The user can manually override the autoselected mode by adding media
options to the appropriate
.Xr ifconfig.if 5
file.
.It 10baseT
Set 10Mbps operation.
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width "full-duplex"
.It full-duplex
Force full-duplex operation.
.It half-duplex
Force half-duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
