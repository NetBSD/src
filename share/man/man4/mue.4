.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Kevin Lo Aq Mt kevlo@openbsd.org
for
.Ox and ported to
.Nx by
.An Rin Okuyama Aq Mt rin@netbsd.org .
.Sh BUGS
If the media type is set to other than 1000BASE-T full-duplex,
data transmission becomes quite unstable.
Also, ukphy mistakenly recognizes 1000BASE-T half-duplex as a supported media
type, although the adapters do not support it.
