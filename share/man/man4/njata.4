.Sh NAME
.Nm njata
.Nd Workbit NinjaATA-32 CardBus IDE controller driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "njata* at cardbus? function ?"
.Cd "njata* at cardbus? function ? flags 0x01	# with wait 0x01"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the following
Workbit Bus-Master CardBus IDE controller chips:
.Bl -tag -width "NinjaATA-32Bi" -offset indent
.It NinjaATA-32Bi
CardBus / PCMCIA dual mode IDE controller
.Pq Dq DuoATA .
This controller is mainly used for portable drives.
This driver supports the CardBus mode.
.It NPATA-32
CardBus IDE controller.
This controller is widely used for CardBus CompactFlash adapters.
.El
.Pp
These controllers are capable of bus-mastering
for ATA PIO transfer.
The
.Nm
driver uses the bus-mastering PIO transfer
unless transfer buffer is unaligned,
and significantly reduces CPU usage for PIO-only ATA devices
compared with usual PIO transfer.
.Sh CONFIGURATION
The optional flags parameter is the
.Dq wait
value for ATA transfers.
Some combinations of host and device may fail without flags parameter or
.Cd flags 0x00 .
In this case try adding wait values like
.Cd flags 0x01
or
.Cd flags 0x11
(the wait parameter is composed of two 4-bit values).
Smaller wait values should be faster.
Too long waits may cause transfer errors.
