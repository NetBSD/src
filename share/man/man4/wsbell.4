.Dt WSBELL 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm wsbell
.Nd generic bell support in wscons
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "wsbell*    at spkr? console?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver utilizes the
.Xr speaker 4
driver to provide a system bell with or without a keyboard for the
.Xr wscons 4
framework.
When a bell character is received on a
.Xr wsdisplay 4
screen,
.Nm
sounds the bell.
.Pp
The
.Xr wsconsctl 8
utility gives access to several configurable parameters that effect the sound
of the system bell.
.Ss Ioctls
The following
.Xr ioctl 2
calls are provided by the
.Nm
driver.
Their definitions are found in
.Pa dev/wscons/wsconsio.h .
.Bl -tag -width Dv
.It Dv WSKBDIO_BELL
Will sound the default bell.
.It Dv WSKBDIO_GETBELL
Will return a struct wskbd_bell_data with the current bell parameters.
.It Dv WSKBDIO_SETBELL
Takes a struct wskbd_bell_data and uses it to set the bell parameters.
These are used by the WSKBDIO_BELL
.Xr ioctl 2
call.
.It Dv WSKBDIO_COMPLEXBELL
Will sound a bell using a supplied struct wskbd_bell_data for its parameters.
.It Dv WSKBDIO_GETDEFAULTBELL
Will return a struct wskbd_bell_data with the
.Em default
bell parameters.
.It Dv WSKBDIO_SETDEFAULTBELL
Takes a struct wskbd_bell_data and uses it to set the
.Em default
bell parameters.
.El
.Pp
Ioctls use the following structure:
.Bd -literal
struct wskbd_bell_data {
	u_int	which;			/* values to get/set */
#define	WSKBD_BELL_DOPITCH	0x1	/* get/set pitch */
#define	WSKBD_BELL_DOPERIOD	0x2	/* get/set period */
#define	WSKBD_BELL_DOVOLUME	0x4	/* get/set volume */
#define	WSKBD_BELL_DOALL	0x7	/* all of the above */
	u_int	pitch;			/* pitch, in Hz */
	u_int	period;			/* period, in milliseconds */
	u_int	volume;			/* percentage of max volume */
};
