.El
.Pp
The NetXtreme II product family is composed of various Converged NIC (or CNIC)
Ethernet controllers which support a TCP Offload Engine (TOE),
Remote DMA (RDMA), and iSCSI acceleration,
in addition to standard L2 Ethernet traffic,
all on the same controller.
The following features are supported in the
.Nm
driver under
.Nx :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
IPv4 receive IP/TCP/UDP checksum offload
Jumbo frames (up to 9022 bytes)
VLAN tag insertion
Interrupt coalescing
10/100/1000Mbps operation in full-duplex mode
10/100Mbps operation in half-duplex mode
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm 10baseT/UTP"
.It Cm autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode via
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.It Cm 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Ic mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Ic mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 1000baseTX
Set 1000baseTX operation over twisted pair.
Only
.Cm full-duplex
mode is supported.
.It Cm 1000baseSX
Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation.
Both
.Cm full-duplex
and
.Cm half-duplex
modes are supported.
.It Cm 2500baseSX
Set 2500Mbps operation.
Only
.Cm full-duplex
mode is supported.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm full-duplex"
.It Cm full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It Cm half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An David Christensen Aq Mt davidch@broadcom.com
in
.Fx ,
where it is called
.Nm bce .
And it's ported to
.Ox
by
.An Brad Smith Aq Mt brad@openbsd.org .
It's ported to
.Nx
by Quentin Garnier.
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Nx 4.0 .
