.Sh NAME
.Nm aac
.Nd Adaptec AdvancedRAID Controller driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "aac* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "ld* at aac? unit ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Adaptec AAC family of SCSI
and SATA RAID controllers.
These controllers support RAID 0, 1, 5, 10, and volume sets.
They have four channels in the add-in version
or 1-2 channels in the motherboard integrated version,
and are most often found rebadged by Dell, Hewlett-Packard or IBM.
Supported controllers include:

Access to RAID containers is available via the
.Nm ld
device driver.
Individual drives cannot be accessed unless they are part of a container
or volume set, and non-fixed disks cannot be accessed.
Containers can be configured by using the on-board BIOS utility of
the card.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The adapter can send status and alert messages asynchronously to the driver.
These messages are printed on the system console.

.Xr ld 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Nx 1.6 ,
and was based on the
.Fx
driver of the same name.
.Sh BUGS
This driver is not compatible with controllers that have version 1.x firmware.
The firmware version is the same as the kernel version printed in the BIOS
POST and driver attach messages.
