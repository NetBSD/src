.Sh NAME
.Nm hpc
.Nd SGI High performance Peripheral Controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "hpc0 at gio0 addr 0x1fb80000"
.Cd "hpc1 at gio0 addr 0x1fb00000"
.Cd "hpc2 at gio0 addr 0x1fb98000"
.Cd "hpc3 at gio0 addr 0x1fb90000"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
interfaces the peripherals connected to it to the
.Xr gio 4
bus.
.Nm
is found on the Personal Iris 4D/3x, Indigo, Indy, Challenge S, Challenge M,
and Indigo2 machines.
.Pp
There are three different numerical revisions of the
.Nm
controller.
Revisions 1 and 1.5 exist on Personal Iris 4D/3x and Indigo machines,
as well as GIO32bis expansion cards such as the E++ SEEQ-based
Ethernet adapter.
Revision 1.5 supports bi-endian operation.
Revision 3 exists on Indy, Challenge S, Indigo2, and Challenge M systems.
It is possible to have an on-board HPC3 as well as HPC1.5-based
GIO32bis adapters in the Indy and Challenge S systems.
Additionally, the Challenge S may have a secondary HPC3 if the IOPLUS
(a.k.a. ''mezzanine'') board is installed.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Nx 1.6
with support for Revision 3.
Revision 1 and 1.5 support was added in
.Nx 2.0 .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
Revisions 1 and 1.5 support DMA buffer pointers of only 28 bits
and may therefore only address 256 megabytes of memory.
The R4k Indigo and Indy are the only systems that support sufficient
memory to illustrate this drawback.
A software workaround is not currently implemented.
Revision 3, with 32 bit pointers, does not have this limitation.
