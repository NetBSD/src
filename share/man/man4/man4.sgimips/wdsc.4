.Sh NAME
.Nm wdsc
.Nd Western Digital WD33c93 SCSI Bus Interface Controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "wdsc* at hpc? offset ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides an abstraction layer between the SCSI hardware
found in multitudinous SGI machines (including Personal Iris series,
Indigo, Indy, Challenge S, Indigo2, and Challenge M) and the machine independent
SCSI drivers described in
.Xr scsibus 4 .
.Pp
In addition to sending the required SCSI commands to
target devices on the SCSI bus, the
.Nm
driver deals with DMA, device interrupts, sync/async negotiation,
and target disconnects/reconnects.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr scsibus 4 ,
.Xr sgimips/hpc 4
.Sh HISTORY
Wayne Knowles ported the sgimips incarnation of the
.Nm
driver from the amiga and atari ports.
It first appeared in
.Nx 1.6 .
