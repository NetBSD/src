.Nd Western Digital WD33c93 SCSI Bus Interface Controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "wdsc* at hpc? offset ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides an abstraction layer between the SCSI hardware
found in multitudinous SGI machines (including Personal Iris series,
Indigo, Indy, Challenge-S, and Indigo2) and the machine independent SCSI
drivers described in
.Xr scsibus 4 .
.Pp
In addition to sending the required SCSI commands to
target devices on the SCSI bus, the
.Nm
driver deals with DMA, device interrupts, sync/async negotiation,
and target disconnects/reconnects.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr hpc 4 ,
.Xr scsibus 4
.Sh HISTORY
Wayne Knowles ported the sgimips incarnation of the
.Nm
driver from the amiga and atari ports.
