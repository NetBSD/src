.Sh NAME
.Nm hythygtemp
.Nd Driver for IST-AG HYT-221/271/939 sensor chip via I2C bus
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "hythygtemp* at iic? addr 0x28"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides measurements from the HYT-221/271/939 humidity/temperature
sensors via the
.Xr envsys 4
framework.
The
.Nm
.Ar addr
argument selects the address at the
.Xr iic 4
bus.
The sampling interval can be changed through the
.Xr sysctl 8
node
.Li hw.hythygtemp0.interval .
.Pp
The sensor chips can be reconfigured to respond to other addresses than the
default value of 0x28 by external utilities, like for example the
.Pa pkgsrc/sysutils/hytctl
package.
.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
The following
.Xr sysctl 3
variables are provided:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It hw.hythygtemp0.interval
Defines the sensor's sampling interval in seconds.
It defaults to 50 seconds.
