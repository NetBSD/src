.Dt IPSECIF 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ipsec
.Nd ipsec interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device ipsecif"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is similar to
.Xr gif 4
over
.Xr ipsec 4
transport mode.
.Xr gif 4
over
.Xr ipsec 4
transport mode are managed by userland programs. In contrast,
.Nm
manages its security policies by itself, that is, when user sets
.Nm
tunnel source and destination address pair, the related security policies
are created automatically in kernel. Therefore, the security policies of
.Nm
are added/deleted atomically. It also means
.Nm
ensures both of in and out security policy pair exist, that is,
.Nm
avoids the troubles which is caused by only one of in and out security
policy pair exists.
.Pp
There is four security policies generated by
.Nm ,
that is, in and out pair for each IPv4 and IPv6. Here is
.Xr ipsec.conf 5
which is the same meaing as that security policies.
.Bd -literal
spdadd "src" "dst" ipv4 -P out ipsec esp/transport//unique;
spdadd "dst" "src" ipv4 -P in ipsec esp/transport//unique;
spdadd "src" "dst" ipv6 -P out ipsec esp/transport//unique;
spdadd "dst" "src" ipv6 -P in ipsec esp/transport//unique;
.Ed
.Pp
Therefore,
.Nm
configuration will fail if you already add such security policies, and
vice versa.
.Pp
The related security associates can be established by IKE daemon such as
.Xr racoon 8 .
They can also be manipulated manually by
.Xr setkey 8
with -u option which we set security policy's unique#.
.Pp
Some if_flags change
.Nm
befavior. IFF_LINK0 can enable Network Address Translator traversal,
IFF_LINK1 can enable ECN friendly mode like
.Xr gif 4 ,
and IFF_LINK2 can enable forwarding inner IPv6 packets.
Only IFF_LINK2 is set by default. If you use only IPv4 packets as
inner packets, you would want to unset IFF_LINK2 to reduce security
associates for IPv6 packets.

.Sh EXAMPLES
Configuration example:
.Bd -literal
Host X--NetBSD A  ----------------tunnel---------- NetBSD B------Host E
           \\                                          |
            \\                                        /
             +-----Router B--------Router C---------+

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device first appeared in
.Nx 8.0 .
.Sh LIMITATIONS
Currently, the
.Nm
interface supports esp protocol only.
.Nm
does not support Network Address Translator traversal(NAT-T).
