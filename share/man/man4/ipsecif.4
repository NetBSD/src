.Dt IPSECIF 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ipsecif
.Nd IPsec interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device ipsecif"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface is targeted for route-based VPNs.
It can tunnel IPv4 and IPv6 traffic over either IPv4 or IPv6 and
secure it with ESP.
.Pp
.Nm
interfaces are dynamically created and destroyed with the
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Cm create
and
.Cm destroy
subcommands.
The administrator must configure
.Nm
tunnel endpoint addresses.
These addresses will be used for the outer IP header of ESP packets.
The administrator also configures the protocol
and addresses for the inner IP header with
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Cm inet
or
.Cm inet6
subcommands, and modify the routing table to route the packets through
the
.Nm
interface.
.Pp
The packet processing is similar to
.Xr gif 4
over
.Xr ipsec 4
transport mode, however their security policy managements are different.
.Xr gif 4
over
.Xr ipsec 4
transport mode expects for userland programs to managed its
security policies.
In contrast,
.Nm
manages its security policies by itself, that is, when the administrator
sets up a
.Nm
tunnel source and destination address pair, the related security policies
are created automatically in the kernel.
Therefore, the security policies of
.Nm
are added/deleted atomically.
.Pp
It also means that
.Nm
ensures that both the in and out security policy pairs exist, that is,
.Nm
avoids the trouble caused when only one of the in and out security
policy pair exists.
.Pp
There are four security policies generated by
.Nm ,
that is, one in and out pair for IPv4 and IPv6 each.
These security policies equal to the following
.Xr ipsec.conf 5
configuration where src and dst are IP addresses specified to the tunnel:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
spdadd "src" "dst" ipv4 -P out ipsec esp/transport//unique;
spdadd "dst" "src" ipv4 -P in ipsec esp/transport//unique;
spdadd "src" "dst" ipv6 -P out ipsec esp/transport//unique;
spdadd "dst" "src" ipv6 -P in ipsec esp/transport//unique;
.Ed
.Pp
Therefore,
.Nm
configuration will fail if you already added such security policies, and
vice versa.
.Pp
The related security associates can be established by an IKE daemon such as
.Xr racoon 8 .
They can also be manipulated manually by
.Xr setkey 8
with the
.Fl u
option which sets a security policy's unique id.
.Pp
Some
.Xr ifconfig 8
parameters change
.Nm Ap s
behaviour.
link0 can enable NAT-Traversal,
link1 can enable ECN friendly mode like
.Xr gif 4 ,
and link2 can enable forwarding inner IPv6 packets.
Only link2 is set by default.
If you use only IPv4 packets as inner packets, you would want to
do
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig ipsec0 -link2
.Ed
.Pp
to reduce security associates for IPv6 packets.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Configuration example:
.Bd -literal

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device first appeared in
.Nx 8.0 .
.Sh LIMITATIONS
Currently, the
.Nm
interface supports the ESP protocol only.
.Nm
supports default port number (4500) only for NAT-Traversal.
