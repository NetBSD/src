.Sh NAME
.Nm ibmcd
.Nd support for the IBM 4810 BSP cash drawer port
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ibmcd* at at pci ? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "gpio* at ibmcd?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver controls the cash drawer port of the IBM 4810 BSP PCI device found
in IBM point of sale terminals (e.g. in the SurePOS 300 series) using the GPIO
subsystem.
.Pp
.Nm
provides a GPIO device with three pins: pin 0 is used to control the cash drawer
while pin 1 can be used to read the current state of the sense input pin.
A logical 0 means the cash drawer is closed, a logical 1 means the cash drawer
is open.
.Pp
Pin 2 reports if a cash drawer is connected.
A logical 0 means there is no cash drawer connected, a logical 1 means the cash drawer is connected.
.Pp
To open the cash drawer, set pin 0 to logical 1.
There is no need to reset pin 0 to logical 0 afterwards as the device generates
a oneshot impulse.
