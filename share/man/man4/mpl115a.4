.Sh NAME
.Nm mpl115a
.Nd Freescale MPL115A2 absolute pressure sensor driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "mpl115a* at iic? addr 0x60"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the MPL115A2 pressure sensor.
It allows reporting absolute pressure through the
.Xr envsys 4
API.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr envsys 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device first appeared in
.Nx 7.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Radoslaw Kujawa Aq radoslaw.kujawa@gmail.com .
The fixed-point pressure calculation algorithm was suggested by
.An Matt Thomas .
.Sh CAVEATS
The MPL115A2 chip has an accuracy of +/- 1 kPa, which makes it not very useful
for weather-related applications.
.Pp
The
.Xr envsys 4
API does not support pressure reporting yet, so the result is reported just as
integer number.
