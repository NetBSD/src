.Sh NAME
.Nm eap
.Nd AudioPCI audio device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "eap*   at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "audio* at audiobus?"
.Cd "joy*   at eap?"
.Cd "midi*  at eap?"
.Cd "options EAP_USE_BOTH_DACS"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Ensoniq AudioPCI and Creative Labs
SoundBlaster PCI series of audio cards.
All models based on the ES1370, ES1371, and ES1373 chips are supported.
.Pp
By specifying:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
options EAP_USE_BOTH_DACS
.Ed
.Pp
a second audio device is attached.
You can use it simply by directing audio output to it.
This way it is possible for two different programs to use the "same"
audio device simultaneously.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ac97 4 ,
.Xr audio 4 ,
.Xr joy 4 ,
.Xr midi 4 ,
.Xr pci 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Nx 1.4 .
.Sh CAVEATS
The joystick port hardware works by emulating a legacy
.Xr isa 4
joystick port, bypassing the
.Xr pci 4
bus method for address allocation.
This is unlikely to work on PCI busses other than the primary one.
There is also a possibility for conflicts with real ISA devices
because the PCI bus is probed before ISA.
Use with caution.
