.Sh NAME
.Nm ichlpcib
.Nd Intel ICH LPC Interface Bridge
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ichlpcib* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "fwhrng*   at ichlpcib?"
.Cd "hpet0     at ichlpcib?"
.Cd "isa0      at ichlpcib?"
.Cd "gpio*     at ichlpcib?"
.Cd "tco*      at ichlpcib?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the Intel ICH LPC Interface Bridges on compatible
chipsets.
Supported functions include:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Watchdog timer.
The watchdog timer may be configured for a 1 seconds (on ICH6 or newer)
and 2 seconds (on ICH5 or older) min period and for a 23 seconds
(on ICH5 or older) or 367 seconds max period (on ICH6 or newer).
.Pp
Prior to
.Nx 8.0 ,
the
.Xr x86/tco 4
watchdog timer was included as part of the
.Nm
driver, and did not require explicit configuration.
.It
Power Management timer.
A 24-bit timer available to be used by the timecounters framework.
.It
SpeedStep.
In some older systems the SpeedStep function is also available, and can be
used to switch between high and low frequency (to reduce power consumption)
via the
.Li machdep.speedstep_state
.Xr sysctl 8
node.
A value of 0 will use the low frequency (low power) and a 1 will
enable the high frequency (full power).
.It
General Purpose Input/Output.
The ICH provides up to 64 I/O pins which can be accessed through the
.Xr gpio 4
framework.
