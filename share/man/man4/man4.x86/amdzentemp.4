.Sh NAME
.Nm amdzentemp
.Nd AMD Zen CPU family on-die digital thermal sensor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "amdzentemp* at amdsmn?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the on-die digital thermal sensor present
on AMD Ryzen CPUs
.Pp
These sensors provide 0.125 degC accuracy. There is one sensor for each
CPU socket.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver reports temperatures through the
.Xr envsys 4
API.

.Xr powerd 8
.Sh BUGS
The temperature reading provided to
.Xr envsys 4
needs to have a CPU-dependant offset applied.
For Ryzen X processors, the offset is 20C, while for Threadripper
processors an offset of 27C is needed.
.Pp
The sensor has thermal-trip value which should be retrieved and
provided to
.Xr envsys 4
as the sensors critical-maximum value.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.4
named
.Dq kate .
It was then ported to
.Nx 5.0
under the name
.Dq amdtemp .
The
.Fx
version of the driver was updated with support for newer AMD CPUs.
For
.Nx ,
the support for the newer CPUs was separated into its own
.Nm
driver.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Constantine A. Murenin Aq Mt cnst@openbsd.org
whilst at the University of Waterloo.
Porting of support for the newer AMD CPUs from
.Fx
was provided by
.An Ian Clark .
