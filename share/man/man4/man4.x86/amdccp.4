.Sh NAME
.Nm amdccp
.Nd AMD Cryptographic Coprocessor device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "amdccp* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for cryptographic coprocessors found on
certain AMD CPUs.
The coprocessor supports hardware offloading for common cryptographic
algorithms and a True Random Number Generator (TRNG).
.Pp
Currently, this driver only supports providing additional entropy
to the kernel's random number generator.
.Sh SEE ALSO
