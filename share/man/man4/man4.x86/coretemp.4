.Sh NAME
.Nm coretemp
.Nd Intel Core on-die digital thermal sensor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "coretemp* at cpu?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the on-die digital thermal sensor present
on Intel Core and newer CPUs.
.Pp
The temperatures can be observed by using the
.Xr envsys 4
.Tn API
or the
.Xr envstat 8
command.
Temperatures are reported for each core separately.
.Sh EVENTS
The
.Nm
driver is able to send a
.Em critical
event to the
.Xr powerd 8
daemon.
The script
.Pa /etc/powerd/scripts/sensor_temperature
will be executed by the daemon (if running) when the limit has been reached.
