variables are available with
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width "machdep.cpu.frequency.available" -offset 2n
.It Ic machdep.cpu.frequency.target
The target frequency of the
.Tn CPUs .
.It Ic machdep.cpu.frequency.current
The current frequency.

.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
driver is considered a legacy interface to
be used only with relatively old systems.
The driver supports only
.Tn AMD
processor families
.Tn K7
(for instance, Duron, Athlon, and some Semprons) and
.Tn K8
(namely, the early 64-bit family, including Athlon 64, Opteron, and Turion).
