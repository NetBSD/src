.Sh NAME
.Nm artsata
.Nd Intel i31244 Serial ATA disk controller driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "artsata* at pci? dev ? function ? flags 0x0000"
.Cd "options PCIIDE_I31244_DISABLEDMA"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the Intel i31244 Serial ATA and controllers,
and provides the interface with the hardware for the
.Xr ata 4
driver.
.Pp
The 0x0002 flag forces the
.Nm
driver to disable DMA on chipsets for which DMA would normally be
enabled.
This can be used as a debugging aid, or to work around
problems where the SATA controller is wired up to the system incorrectly.

.Xr atapi 4 ,

.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr pciide 4 ,
.Xr wd 4 ,
.Xr wdc 4
.Sh BUGS
Early samples of the Intel i31244 Serial ATA controller revision 0 had a
bug affecting DMA data transfers.
Full production samples have been fixed, but have the same revision number.
The
.Dv PCIIDE_I31244_DISABLEDMA
option can be used to disable DMA on the buggy revisions.
