.Sh NAME
.Nm dl
.Nd
.Tn DL-11 Ns / Ns Tn DLV-11
serial device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "dl0 at uba? csr 0176500"
.Cd "dl1 at uba? csr 0176510"
.Cd "dl2 at uba? csr 0176520"
.Cd "dl3 at uba? csr 0176530"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver controls a
.Tn DL-11 Ns -compatible
asynchronous serial card, and probably things compatible with it.
A four-port
.Tn DLV-11J
will appear four times in the device list, as the ports look like
separate cards to the driver.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides the normal interface described in
.Xr tty 4 ,
but many of the configuration calls are unsupported, since their
functions are handled by jumpers or switches on the serial card
itself.
Calls related to modem-control lines are also ignored, since
these cards lack them.
.Pp
There's a chance this driver might also work with an
.Tn LP11 ,
an
.Tn LPV11
or even a
.Tn PC11 ,
but it hasn't been tested.

.\" .Sh EXAMPLES
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It dl%d: rx overrun.
The character in the receive buffer wasn't read before the next
character arrived, and has been lost.
.It dl%d: stray rx interrupt.
The driver was called to service a receive interrupt, but there was
nothing for it to read.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver was written for
.Nx 1.3 .

.Sh BUGS
The
.Tn DL-11
and friends only have single-character receive and transmit buffers,
so an interrupt is generated for every character received or
transmitted.
Attempting to receive data at even moderately high rates
will cause rx overruns.
Fast transmission seems to be fine though.
.Pp
There is no support in the driver for the paper-tape reader on an
.Tn LT33
attached via a
.Tn DLV-11KA
or similar.
.Pp
The overrun message is logged in the interrupt routine itself, which
will probably just make the problem worse.
.Pp
The CSR printed on startup is that of the receiver, while the
interrupt vector is that of the transmitter.
.Pp
In order to determine the card's interrupt vector, the driver sends a
.Dv NUL
to each port.
This may confuse things attached to them.
.Pp
The driver has so far only been tested on a
.Tn DLV-11J .
It may or may not work on the other cards it claims to support.
