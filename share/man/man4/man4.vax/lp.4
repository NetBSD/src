.Sh NAME
.Nm lp
.Nd parallel line printer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "lp0 at uba0 csr 0177514 vector lpintr"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
NOTE: This driver has not been ported from
.Bx 4.4
yet.
.Pp
The
.Nm lp
device
supports
.Tn DEC
and
.Tn DEC
compatible printers
on the
.Tn LP-11
parallel interface.
.Pp
The unit number of the printer is specified by the minor device
after removing the low 3 bits, which act as per-device parameters.
Currently only the lowest of the low three bits is interpreted:
if it is set, the device is assumed to have a 64-character set or
.Pf half Tn -ASCII
mode,
rather than a full 96-character set.
.Pp
If the 64-character set is assumed,
any lower case characters are mapped to upper case; left curly and
right curly braces are mapped to left and right parentheses over
laid with a hyphen; grave accents are mapped to acute accents
with overlaid with a hyphen; the pipe bar character is mapped
to an exclamation sign overlaid with a hyphen; and the tilde
character is mapped to a carat overlaid with a hyphen.
.Pp
The default page width is 132 columns; longer lines are
truncated.
This may be overridden by specifying, for example,
.Ql flags 256 .
