.Sh NAME
.Nm autoconf
.Nd diagnostics from the autoconfiguration code
.Sh DESCRIPTION
When
.Nx
bootstraps it probes the innards of the machine
on which it is running and
locates controllers, drives, and other devices.
Each item found is recorded on the console.
This procedure is driven by a system
configuration table which is processed by
.Xr config 1
and compiled into each kernel.
.Pp
On the
.Tn VAX ,
devices in
.Tn NEXUS
slots are normally noted, thus memory controllers,
.Tn UNIBUS
and
.Tn MASSBUS
adaptors.
Devices which are not supported which are found in
.Tn NEXUS
slots are noted also.
The Q-bus on the
.Tn MICROVAX
is configured in the same way as the
.Tn UNIBUS .
.Pp
.Tn MASSBUS
devices are located by a very deterministic procedure since
.Tn MASSBUS
space is completely probe-able.
If devices exist which
are not configured they will be silently ignored; if devices exist of
unsupported type they will be noted.
.Pp
.Tn UNIBUS
devices are located by probing to see if their control-status
registers respond.
If not, they are silently ignored.
If the control
status register responds but the device cannot be made to interrupt,
a diagnostic warning will be printed on the console and the device
will not be available to the system.
.Pp
Normally, the system uses the disk from which it was loaded as the root
filesystem.
If that is not possible,
a generic system will pick its root device
as the
.Dq best
available device
.Pf ( Tn MASSBUS
disks are better than
.Tn SMD UNIBUS
disks are better than
.Tn RK07 Ns s ;
the device must be drive 0
to be considered).
If such a system is booted with the
.Dv RB_ASKNAME
option (see
.Xr reboot 2 ) ,
then the name of the root device is read from the console terminal at boot
time, and any available device may be used.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It cpu type %d not configured.
You tried to boot
.Nx
on a
.Tn CPU
type which it doesn't (or at least this compiled version of
.Nx
doesn't)
understand.
.It mba%d at tr%d.
A
.Tn MASSBUS
adapter was found in
.Ql tr%d
(the
.Tn NEXUS
slot number).
.Nx
will call it
.Ql mba%d .
.It %d mba's not configured.
More
.Tn MASSBUS
adapters were found on
the machine than were declared in the machine configuration; the excess
.Tn MASSBUS
adapters will not be accessible.
.It uba%d at tr%d.
A
.Tn UNIBUS
adapter was found in
.Ql tr%d
(the
.Tn NEXUS
slot number).
.Nx
will call it
.Ql uba%d .
.It dr32 unsupported (at tr %d).
A
.Tn DR Ns 32
interface was found in
a
.Tn NEXUS ,
for which
.Nx
does not have a driver.
.It ci unsupported (at tr %d).
A
.Tn CI
interface was found in
a
.Tn NEXUS ,
for which
.Nx
does not have a driver.
.It mcr%d at tr%d.
A memory controller was found in
.Ql tr%d
(the
.Tn NEXUS
slot number).
.Nx
will call it
.Ql mcr%d .
.It 5 mcr's unsupported.
.Nx
supports only 4 memory controllers
per
.Tn CPU .
.It mpm unsupported (at tr%d).
Multi-port memory is unsupported
in the sense that
.Nx
does not know how to poll it for
.Tn ECC
errors.
.It %s%d at mba%d drive %d.
A tape formatter or a disk was found
on the
.Tn MASSBUS ;
for disks
.Ql %s%d
will look like
.Dq Li hp0 ,
for tape formatters
like
.Dq Li ht1 .
The drive number comes from the unit plug on the drive
or in the
.Tn TM
formatter
.Pf ( Em not
on the tape drive; see below).
.It %s%d at %s%d slave %d.
(For
.Tn MASSBUS
devices).
Which would look like
.Dq Li tu0 at ht0 slave 0 ,
where
.Dq Li tu0
is the name for the tape device and
.Dq Li ht0
is the name
for the formatter.
A tape slave was found on the tape formatter at the
indicated drive number (on the front of the tape drive).
.Ux
will call the device, e.g.,
.Dq Li tu0 .
.It "%s%d at uba%d csr %o vec %o ipl %x."
The device
.Ql %s%d ,
e.g.
.Dq Li dz0
was found on
.Ql uba%d
at control-status register address
.Ql \&%o
and with
device vector
.Ql \&%o .
The device interrupted at priority level
.Ql \&%x .
.It %s%d at uba%d csr %o zero vector.
The device did not present
a valid interrupt vector, rather presented 0 (a passive release condition)
to the adapter.
.It %s%d at uba%d csr %o didn't interrupt.
The device did not interrupt,
likely because it is broken, hung, or not the kind of device it is advertised
to be.
.It %s%d at %s%d slave %d.
(For UNIBUS devices).
Which would look like
.Dq Li up0 at sc0 slave 0 ,
where
.Dq Li up0
is the name of a disk drive and
.Dq Li sc0
is the name
of the controller.
Analogous to
.Tn MASSBUS
case.
