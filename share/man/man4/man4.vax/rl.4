.Sh NAME
.Nm rl
.Nd
.Tn RL11 Ns / Tn RL01
and
.Tn RL02
disk interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "rlc0 at uba? csr 0177440"
.Cd "rl0 at rlc0 drive 0"
.Cd "rl* at rlc? drive ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm rl
driver
is a typical block-device disk driver; block device
.Tn I/O
is
described in
.Xr physio 4 .
.Pp
The script
.Xr MAKEDEV 8
should be used to create the special files; if a special file
needs to be created by hand consult
.Xr mknod 8 .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/rrl[0-7][a-h] -compact
.It Pa /dev/rl[0-7][a-h]
block files
.It Pa /dev/rrl[0-7][a-h]
raw files
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "rl%d: operation incomplete"
The current command to the disk did not complete within the timeout period.
This may be due to hardware failure or a heavily loaded UNIBUS.
.It "rl%d: read data CRC"
The controller detected a CRC error on data read from the disk.
Probably a bad disk pack.
.It "rl%d: header CRC"
The controller detected a CRC error on header data read from the disk.
Probably a bad disk pack.
.It "rl%d: data late"
The controller was not able to transfer data over the bus fast enough to
not overflow/underflow the internal FIFO, probably because a heavily
loaded UNIBUS or mis-ordered UNIBUS devices.
.It "rl%d: header not found"
The requested sector was not found before the timer expired.
If this error is the only error then it may indicate a software bug.
.It "rl%d: non-existent memory"
The controller tried to do DMA to/from a non-mapped address.
This is a software bug.
.It "rl%d: memory parity error"
The host memory data sent had a parity error.
This is a hardware failure.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver has been around nearly forever.
.Pp
A complete new
.Nm
driver showed up in
.Nx 1.5 .
.Sh BUGS
Error handling is less than optimal.
.Pp
Seeks should be interleaved between multiple disks.
