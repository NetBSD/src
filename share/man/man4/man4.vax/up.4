.Sh NAME
.Nm up
.Nd UNIBUS storage module controller/disk drives
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "sc0 at uba? csr 0176700 vector upintr"
.Cd "up0 at sc0 drive 0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
NOTE: This driver has not been ported from
.Bx 4.4
yet.
.Pp
This is a generic
.Tn UNIBUS
storage module disk driver.
It is specifically designed to work with the
Emulex
.Tn SC-21
and
.Tn SC-31
controllers.
It can be easily
adapted to other controllers (although bootstrapping will
not necessarily be directly possible.)
.Pp
The script
.Xr MAKEDEV 8
should be used to create the
.Nm up
special files; consult
.Xr mknod 8
if a special file needs to be made manually.
It is recommended as a security precaution to not create special files
for devices which may never be installed.
.Sh DISK SUPPORT
The driver interrogates the controller's holding register
to determine the type of drive attached.
The driver recognizes seven different drives:
.Tn CDC
9762,
.Tn CDC
9766,
.Tn AMPEX DM Ns 980 ,
.Tn AMPEX
9300,
.Tn AMPEX
Capricorn,
.Tn FUJITSU
160, and
.Tn FUJITSU
Eagle
(the Eagle is not supported by the SC-21).
.Pp
Special file names begin with
.Sq Li up
and
.Sq Li rup
for the block and character files respectively.
The second component of the name, a drive unit number in the range
of zero to seven, is represented by a
.Sq Li \&?
in the disk layouts below.
The last component of the name, the file system partition, is
designated by a letter from
.Sq Li a
to
.Sq Li h
which also corresponds to a minor device number set: zero to seven,
eight to 15, 16 to 23 and so forth for drive zero, drive two and drive
three respectively (see
.Xr physio 4 ) .
The location and size (in 512 byte sectors) of the
partitions for the above drives:

.Pp
The up?a partition is normally used for the root file system,
the up?b partition as a paging area,
and the up?c partition for pack-pack copying (it maps the entire disk).
On 160M drives the up?g partition maps the rest of the pack.
On other drives both up?g and up?h are used to map the
remaining cylinders.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "up%d%c: hard error %sing fsbn %d[-%d] cs2=%b er1=%b er2=%b."
An unrecoverable error occurred during transfer of the specified
filesystem block number(s),
which are logical block numbers on the indicated partition.
The contents of the cs2, er1 and er2 registers are printed
in octal and symbolically with bits decoded.
The error was either unrecoverable, or a large number of retry attempts
(including offset positioning and drive recalibration) could not
recover the error.
.Pp
.It "up%d: write locked."
The write protect switch was set on the drive
when a write was attempted.
The write operation is not recoverable.
.Pp
.It "up%d: not ready."
The drive was spun down or off line when it was
accessed.
The I/O operation is not recoverable.
.Pp
.It "up%d: not ready (flakey)."
The drive was not ready, but after
printing the message about being not ready (which takes a fraction
of a second) was ready.
The operation is recovered if no further errors occur.
.Pp
.It "up%d%c: soft ecc reading fsbn %d[-%d]."
A recoverable ECC error occurred on the
specified sector of the specified disk partition.
This happens normally
a few times a week.
If it happens more frequently than this the sectors where the errors
are occurring should be checked to see if certain cylinders on the
pack, spots on the carriage of the drive or heads are indicated.
.Pp
.It "sc%d: lost interrupt."
A timer watching the controller detecting
no interrupt for an extended period while an operation was outstanding.
This indicates a hardware or software failure.
There is currently a hardware/software problem with spinning down
drives while they are being accessed which causes this error to
occur.
The error causes a
.Tn UNIBUS
reset, and retry of the pending operations.
If the controller continues to lose interrupts, this error will recur
a few seconds later.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm up
driver appeared in
.Bx 4.0 .
.Sh BUGS
A program to analyze the logged error information (even in its
present reduced form) is needed.
.Pp
The partition tables for the file systems should be read off of each
pack, as they are never quite what any single installation would prefer,
and this would make packs more portable.
