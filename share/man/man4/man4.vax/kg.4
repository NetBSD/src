.Tn KL-11 Ns / Ns Tn DL-11W
line clock
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "kg0 at uba0 csr 0176500 vector kglock"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
NOTE: This driver has not been ported from
.Bx 4.4
yet.
.Pp
A
.Tn KL-11
or
.Tn DL-11W
can be used as an alternative real
time clock
source.
When configured, certain system
statistics and, optionally, system profiling work
will be collected each time the clock interrupts.
For optimum accuracy in profiling, the
.Tn DL-11W
should be
configured to interrupt at the highest possible priority
level.
The
.Nm kg
device driver automatically calibrates itself to the
line clock frequency.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr config 1 ,
.Xr kgmon 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
