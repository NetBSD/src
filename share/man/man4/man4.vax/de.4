.Sh NAME
.Nm de
.Nd
.Tn DEC DEUNA/DELUA
10 Mb/s Ethernet interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "de0 at uba? csr 174510"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Ethernet network through
a Digital Equipment
.Tn UNIBUS
Network Adapter
.Pq Tn DEUNA .
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It de%d: hardware address %s.
This is a normal autoconfiguration message noting the 6 byte physical
Ethernet address of the adapter.
.It de%d: oerror, flags=%b tdrerr=%b (len=%d).
The hardware indicated an error
in transmitting a packet to the cable.
The status and error flags are reported.
.It de%d: ierror, flags=%b lenerr=%b (len=%d).
The hardware indicated an error
in reading a packet from the cable.
The status and error flags are reported.
.El
.Pp
The following messages indicate a probable hardware error performing
the indicated operation during autoconfiguration or initialization.
The two control and status registers
should indicate the nature of the failure.
See the hardware manual for details.
.Bl -diag
.It de%d: reset failed, csr0=%b csr1=%b.
.It de%d: ppcb failed, csr0=%b csr1=%b.
.It de%d: read addr failed, csr0=%b csr1=%b.
.It de%d: wtring failed, csr0=%b csr1=%b.
.It de%d: wtmode failed, csr0=%b csr1=%b.
