driver supports ACPI Control Method Battery.
.Pp
The status can be monitored by
.Xr envsys 4
API or
.Xr envstat 8
command.

argument to the
.Fa /etc/powerd/scripts/sensor_battery
script. If a custom capacity limit was set via
.Xr envstat 8 ,
the
.Nm
driver will report a
.Em user-capacity
event to the same script when current capacity limit has been reached.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr acpi 4 ,
.Xr envsys 4 ,
.Xr envstat 8 ,
