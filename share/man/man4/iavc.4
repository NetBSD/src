.Sh NAME
.Nm iavc
.Nd isdn4bsd AVM B1 driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "iavc* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver is used to glue the AVM family of active cards to the
.Xr isdncapi 4
driver and the
.Em isdn4bsd
package.
Currently only the AVM B1 PCI is supported.
Support for the AVM B1 ISA and the AVM T1 PCI cards should be quite
easy to add, since support already exists in the
.Fx
version of the driver.
.Pp
To use this driver, you must first fetch the firmware file
.Nm b1.t4
from
.Lk ftp://ftp.avm.de/
and load it to the card using
.Xr isdnd 8 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr isdncapi 4 ,
.Xr isdnd 8
.Sh STANDARDS
.Lk http://www.capi.org/ "CAPI 2.0"
