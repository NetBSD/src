.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Ss Driver initialisation/shutdown phase
.Bl -diag
.It amr%d: memory window not available
.It amr%d: I/O window not available
.Pp
The PCI BIOS did not allocate resources necessary for the correct operation of
the controller.
The driver cannot attach to this controller.
.It amr%d: busmaster bit not set, enabling
.Pp
The PCI BIOS did not enable busmaster DMA,
which is required for the correct operation of the controller.
The driver has enabled this bit and initialisation will proceed.
.It amr%d: can't allocate register window
.It amr%d: can't allocate interrupt
.It amr%d: can't set up interrupt
.It amr%d: can't allocate parent DMA tag
.It amr%d: can't allocate buffer DMA tag
.It amr%d: can't allocate scatter/gather DMA tag
.It amr%d: can't allocate s/g table
.It amr%d: can't allocate mailbox tag
.It amr%d: can't allocate mailbox memory
.Pp
A resource allocation error occurred while initialising the driver;
initialisation has failed and the driver will not attach to this controller.
.It amr%d: can't obtain configuration data from controller
.It amr%d: can't obtain product data from controller
.Pp
The driver was unable to obtain vital configuration data from the controller.
Initialisation has failed and the driver will not attach to this controller.
.It amr%d: can't establish configuration hook
.It amr%d: can't scan controller for drives
.Pp
The scan for logical drives managed by the controller failed.
No drives will be attached.
.It amr%d: device_add_child failed
.It amr%d: bus_generic_attach returned %d
.Pp
Creation of the logical drive instances failed;
attachment of one or more logical drives may have been aborted.
.It amr%d: flushing cache...
.Pp
The controller cache is being flushed prior to shutdown or detach.
.El
.Ss Operational diagnostics
.Bl -diag
.It amr%d: I/O beyond end of unit (%u,%d > %u)
.Pp
A partitioning error or disk corruption has caused an I/O request
beyond the end of the logical drive.
This may also occur if FlexRAID Virtual Sizing is enabled and
an I/O operation is attempted on a portion of the virtual drive
beyond the actual capacity available.
.It amr%d: polled command timeout
.Pp
An initialisation command timed out.
The initialisation process may fail as a result.
.It amr%d: bad slot %d completed
.Pp
The controller reported completion of a command that the driver did not issue.
This may result in data corruption,
and suggests a hardware or firmware problem with the system or controller.
.It amr%d: I/O error - %x
.Pp
An I/O error has occurred.
