.Sh NAME
.Nm ipw
.Nd Intel PRO/Wireless 2100 IEEE 802.11 driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ipw* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Intel PRO/Wireless 2100 MiniPCI network
adapter.
.Pp
The Intel firmware requires acceptance of the End User License Agreement.
The full license text can be found in
/libdata/firmware/if_ipw/LICENSE.
The license is agreed to by setting the sysctl variable
.Dv hw.ipw.accept_eula
to 1.
.Pp
By default, the
.Nm
driver configures the adapter for BSS operation (aka infrastructure mode).
This mode requires the use of an access point.
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh EXAMPLES
Join an existing BSS network (i.e.: connect to an access point):
.Pp
.Dl "ifconfig ipw0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 0xffffff00"
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with network name
.Dq Li my_net :
.Pp
.Dl "ifconfig ipw0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 0xffffff00 nwid my_net"
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with 64 bits WEP encryption:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig ipw0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 0xffffff00 nwid my_net \e
        nwkey 0x1234567890
.Ed
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with 128bits WEP encryption:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig ipw0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 0xffffff00 nwid my_net \e
        nwkey 0x01020304050607080910111213
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "ipw%d: device timeout"
The driver will reset the hardware.
This should not happen.
