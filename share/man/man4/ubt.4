.Sh NAME
.Nm ubt
.Nd USB Bluetooth driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ubt* at uhub? port ? configuration ? interface ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB Bluetooth dongles
to the Bluetooth protocol stack.
.Pp
USB Bluetooth dongles provide two interfaces, both of which the
.Nm
driver claims. The second interface is used for Isochronous data and will have
several alternate configurations regarding bandwidth consumption, which can be
set using the hw.ubtN.config
.Xr sysctl 8 
variable. The number of alternate configurations is indicated by the value
in the hw.ubtN.alt_config variable, and the isoc frame size for the current
configuration is shown in the hw.ubtN.sco_rxsize, and hw.ubtN.sco_txsize
variables.
.Pp
By default, configuration 0 is selected, which means that no bandwidth
is used on the Isochronous interface and no SCO data can be sent. Consult
the Bluetooth USB specification at https://www.bluetooth.org/ for complete
instructions on setting bandwidth consumption. The following extract may be
useful as a general guidance though details may differ between manufacturers.

.Sh HISTORY
This
.Nm
device driver was originally a character device written by
.An "David Sainty"
and
.An "Lennart Augustsson" .
It was rewritten to support socket based Bluetooth access for
.Nx 4.0
by
.An "Iain Hibbert" .
.Sh BUGS
The Isochronous configuration can only be changed when the device is not
marked up.
