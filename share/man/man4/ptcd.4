.Sh NAME
.Nm ptcd
.Nd support for the Protech PS3100 cash drawer port
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ptcd* at isa? port 0x48d"
.Cd "gpio* at ptcd?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver controls the cash drawer port of the Protech PS3100 point of sale
terminal using the GPIO subsystem.
.Pp
.Nm
provides a GPIO device with two pins: pin 0 is used to control the cash drawer
while pin 1 can be used to read the current state of the sense input pin.
A logical 0 means the cash drawer is closed, a logical 1 means the cash drawer
is open.
.Pp
To open the cash drawer, set pin 0 to logical 1 for a short period
of time (e.g. < 1 sec) and then reset the pin to logical 0.
.Sh CAVEATS
As it is not possible to detect the hardware at runtime, this driver, when
enabled, will always attach.
Only enable it in your kernel configuration if you have the proper hardware.
