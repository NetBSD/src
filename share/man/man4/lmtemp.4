.Sh NAME
.Nm lmtemp
.Nd National Semiconductor LM75, LM77 and compatible hardware monitors
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "lmtemp0 at i2c? addr 0x48 flags 0x0000"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the
.Tn National Semiconductor
LM on iicbus series temperatures and register compatible chips to be used
with the
.Xr envsys 4
API.
The
.Nm
supports ranges of the temperature between +125 from -55.
