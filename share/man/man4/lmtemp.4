.Sh NAME
.Nm lmtemp
.Nd National Semiconductor LM75, LM77 and compatible hardware monitors
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "lmtemp0 at iic? addr 0x48 flags 0x0000"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the
.Tn National Semiconductor
LM on iicbus series temperatures and register compatible chips to be used
with the
.Xr envsys 4
API.
The
.Nm
supports ranges of the temperature between +125 from -55.
.Pp
Each device is specified by the value of the address and flags.
