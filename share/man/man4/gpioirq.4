.Dt GPIOIRQ 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm gpioirq
.Nd Install an interrupt handler on a GPIO pin
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "gpioirq* at gpio? offset 0 mask 0x1 flag 0x00"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver attaches an interrupt handler to a single GPIO pin.
.Pp
The pin number is specified in the kernel configuration file with the
.Ar offset
locator.
The
.Ar mask
locator should always be 0x1.
.Pp
The
.Ar flag
locator specifies the interrupt mode to use:
.Bl -tag -width "XXXXXXXX"
.It Dv 0x01
Interrupt on the positive
.Pq rising
edge of the pin.
.It Dv 0x02
Interrupt on the negative
.Pq falling
edge of the pin.
.It Dv 0x04
Interrupt on both edges of the pin.
.It Dv 0x08
Assert the intrerrupt as long as the pin is high.
.It Dv 0x10
Assert the interrupt as long as the pin is low.
.El
.Pp
Note that the interrupts modes are mutually-exclusive, and exactly one
interrupt mode must be specified.
These flags correspond to the
.Dv GPIO_INTR
mode bits defined in
.Pa sys/gpio.h .
In addition to the interrupt mode, setting
.Dv 0x1000
in
.Ar flags
will enable the printing of a message to the console whenever the
interrupt handler is called.
.Pp
The
.Ar offset ,
.Ar mask ,
and
.Ar flag
locators can also be specified when
.Nm
is attached at runtime using the
.Dv GPIOATTACH
.Xr ioctl 2
on the
.Xr gpio 4
device.

.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Nx 9.0 .
