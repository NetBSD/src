.El
.Pp
The SysKonnect based adapters consist of two main components: the
XaQti Corp. XMAC II Gigabit MAC
.Pq Nm sk
and the SysKonnect GEnesis controller ASIC
.Pq Nm skc .
The XMAC provides the Gigabit MAC and PHY support
while the GEnesis provides an interface to the PCI bus, DMA support,
packet buffering and arbitration.
The GEnesis can control up to two XMACs simultaneously,
allowing dual-port NIC configurations.
.Pp
The Marvell based adapters are a single integrated circuit, but are
still presented as a separate MAC
.Pq Nm sk
and controller ASIC
.Pq Nm skc .
At this time, there are no dual-port Marvell based NICs.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver configures dual port SysKonnect adapters such that each XMAC
is treated as a separate logical network interface.
Both ports can operate independently of each other and can be connected
to separate networks.
The SysKonnect driver software currently only uses the second port on
dual port adapters for failover purposes: if the link
on the primary port fails, the SysKonnect driver will automatically
switch traffic onto the second port.
.Pp
The XaQti XMAC II supports full and half duplex operation with
autonegotiation.
The XMAC also supports unlimited frame sizes.
Support for jumbo frames is provided via the interface MTU setting.
Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the
.Xr ifconfig 8
utility configures the adapter to receive and transmit jumbo frames.
Using jumbo frames can greatly improve performance for certain tasks,
such as file transfers and data streaming.
.Pp
Hardware TCP/IP checksum offloading for IPv4 is available but not
supported by the driver.
.Pp
The following media types and options (as given to
.Xr ifconfig 8 )
are supported:
.Bl -tag -width xxx -offset indent
.It Cm media No autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode.
.\" by adding media options to the appropriate
.\" .Xr hostname.if 5
.\" file.
.It Cm media No 1000baseSX Cm mediaopt No full-duplex
Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation on fiber and force full-duplex mode.
.It Cm media No 1000baseSX Cm mediaopt No half-duplex
Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation on fiber and force half-duplex mode.
.It Cm media No 1000baseT Cm mediaopt No full-duplex
Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation and force full-duplex mode.
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
To view a list of media types and options supported by the card, try
.Ic ifconfig Fl m Aq device .
For example,
.Ic ifconfig Fl m Ar sk0 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "sk%d: couldn't map memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "sk%d: couldn't map ports"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "sk%d: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "sk%d: failed to enable memory mapping!"
The driver failed to initialize PCI shared memory mapping.
This might happen if the card is not in a bus-master slot.
.It "sk%d: no memory for jumbo buffers!"
The driver failed to allocate memory for jumbo frames during
initialization.
.It "sk%d: watchdog timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 3.0 .
.Ox
support was added in
.Ox 2.6 .
.Nx
support was added in
.Nx 2.0 .
.Pp
The
.Nm msk
driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.0 ,
and was ported to
.Nx 4.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Bill Paul Aq wpaul@ctr.columbia.edu .
Support for the Marvell Yukon-2 was added by
.An Mark Kettenis Aq kettenis@openbsd.org .
.Sh BUGS
This driver is
.Em experimental .
.Pp
Support for checksum offload is unimplemented.
.Pp
Performance with at least some Marvell-based adapters is poor,
especially on loaded PCI buses or when the adapters are behind
PCI-PCI bridges.
It is believed that this is because the Marvell parts have
significantly less buffering than the original SysKonnect cards
had.
