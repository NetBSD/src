.Sh NAME
.Nm podulebus
.Nd Acorn Expansion Card bus driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd podulebus0 at root
.Pq Nx Ns /acorn32
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver handles the expansion-card interface in Archimedes machines and
their successors.
This includes conventional expansion cards, mini
expansion cards (as introduced in the A3000), network expansion cards
(as introduced in the A3020), DEBI expansion cards (as introduced in
the Risc PC), and Mk II network cards (also introduced in the Risc PC).
Drivers for individual cards attach as children of the
.Nm
device.
.Pp
.Nx
includes several machine-independent expansion card device drivers.
There are also some device drivers which are specific to
.Nx Ns /acorn32 .
