.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver attaches to USB modems, serial ports, and other devices that need
to look like a tty.
The
.Nm
driver shows a behaviour like a
.Xr tty 4 .
This means that normal programs such as
.Xr tip 1
or
.Xr pppd 8
can be used to access the device.
.Pp
The
.Va portno
locator can be used to decide which port to use for device that have
multiple external ports.
.Pp
Note that while
.Nm
supports the (undocumented) pulse-per-second API normally used on
conventional serial ports, USB serial devices typically have a varying
latency around 1 ms due to the USB frame structure.
.Pp
The ttyXX devices are traditional dial-in devices; the dtyXX devices
are used for dial-out.

.Xr tty 4 . )
