.Sh NAME
.Nm iwi
.Nd Intel PRO/Wireless 2200BG/2915ABG IEEE 802.11 driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "iwi* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Intel(R) PRO/Wireless 2200BG and 2915ABG MiniPCI
network adapters.
.Pp
By default, the
.Nm
driver configures the adapter for BSS operation (aka infrastructure mode).
This mode requires the use of an access point.
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
The Intel firmware requires acceptance of the End User License Agreement.
The full license text can be found in
.Pa /libdata/firmware/if_iwi/LICENSE.ipw2200-fw .
The license is agreed to by setting the sysctl variable
.Dv hw.iwi.accept_eula
to 1.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Join an existing BSS network (i.e.: connect to an access point):
.Pp
.Dl "ifconfig iwi0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 0xffffff00"
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with network name
.Dq Li my_net :
.Pp
.Dl "ifconfig iwi0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 0xffffff00 nwid my_net"
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with 64 bits WEP encryption:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig iwi0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 0xffffff00 nwid my_net \e
        nwkey 0x1234567890
.Ed
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with 128bits WEP encryption:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig iwi0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 0xffffff00 nwid my_net \e
        nwkey 0x01020304050607080910111213
