.Sh NAME
.Nm xbdback
.Nd Xen backend paravirtualized block device interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device xbdback"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface forms the backend part of the paravirtualized drivers
used by
.Tn Xen
domains to offer a block device interface, similar to a hard disk.
.Nm
interfaces are backed either by a physical device directly,
or an image file mounted through
.Xr vnd 4 .
.Pp
All
.Nm
interfaces follow the
.Dq xbdbackXiY
naming convention, where
.Sq X
represents the guest domain identifier, and
.Sq Y
an arbitrary identifier.
This identifier is usually associated to the device node as seen
by the guest using
.Xr major 3
and
.Xr minor 3
numbers.
For example, identifier
.Do 769 Dc Po 0x301 Pc
means major
.Em 3
and minor
.Em 1 ,
identified as
.Dq hda1
under Linux convention.
For
.Nx ,
the guest device name specified in the guest configuration file
does not matter, and can be chosen arbitrarily.
.Pp
A
.Nm
interface will appear as a
.Xr xbd 4
block device inside a
.Nx
guest domain.
In the XenStore,
.Nm xbd
and
.Nm xbdback
are identified by
.Dq vbd
(virtual block device)
entries.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "xbd backend: attach device %s (size %d) for domain %d"
Gives the device used as
.Nm
interface for the given guest domain, and its size, in bytes.
.It "xbd backend 0x%x for domain %d using event channel %d, protocol %s"
Gives the backend identifier, guest domain ID, event channel ID, and
protocol used for block level communication.
.It "xbdback %s: can't VOP_OPEN device 0x%x: %d"
When this message appears in the system message buffer with error 16
.Po Er EBUSY Pc ,
the device is likely to be already mounted.
It must be unmounted first, as the system will refuse to open
it a second time.

.Sh HISTORY
The

driver first appeared in
.Nx 4.0 .

.Nm
driver was written by
