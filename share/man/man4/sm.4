.Sh NAME
.Nm sm
.Nd SMC91Cxx-based Ethernet interfaces device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "sm0 at ifpga0 addr 0xb8000000 irq 27"
.Cd "sm0 at isa? port 0x300 irq 10"
.Cd "sm* at mhzc?"
.Cd "sm* at pcmcia? function ?"
.Cd "sm* at nubus?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports SMC91C9x-based and SMC91C1xx-based Ethernet interfaces.
.Pp
The ifpga0 attachment of the
.Nm
driver supports SMC91C9x-based Ethernet interface on the ARM Integrator/CP
board.
.Pp
The ISA attachment of the
.Nm
driver supports any SMC91C9x-based Ethernet interface on the ISA
bus, including the EFA Info*Express SVC VLB interface, and the
on-board SMC91C9x Ethernet found in many embedded PCs and laptop
docking stations.
.Pp
The mhzc attachment of the
.Nm
driver supports the Megahertz combo Ethernet and modem card.
.Pp
The PCMCIA attachment of the
.Nm
driver supports Megahertz X-JACK Ethernet cards.
.Pp
The nubus attachment of the
.Nm
driver supports SMC-based Ethernet cards for the macintosh.
.Sh MEDIA SELECTION
The SMC91C1xx supports the MII interface and so the list of supported
media depends on several factors, including which PHY is attached.
The SMC91C9x supports AUI and UTP media types.
.Pp
To enable the AUI media, select the
.Em 10base5
or
.Em aui
media type with
.Xr ifconfig 8 Ns 's
.Cm media
directive.
To select UTP, select the
.Em 10baseT
or
.Em utp
media type.
.Pp
.Xr ifconfig 8 Ns 's
.Fl m
option will display the full list of supported
.Cm media
directives for a particular configuration.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "sm0: unable to read MAC address from CIS"
This indicates that the Ethernet address, which is stored in the
CIS information on the Megahertz X-JACK PCMCIA Ethernet card, is
corrupted.
