.Sh NAME
.Nm acpiec
.Nd ACPI Embedded Controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "acpiec* at acpi?"
.Cd "acpiecdt* at acpi?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports ACPI Embedded Controllers.
.Pp
It provides
embedded controller access for other ACPI devices.
On many systems which have an
.Nm
device, other ACPI devices such as
.Xr acpiacad 4 ,
.Xr acpibat 4 ,
or
.Xr acpitz 4
implicitly depend on the
.Nm
device.
Therefore it is a good idea to enable
.Nm
with other ACPI devices unless you are sure
the system does not have an
.Nm
device.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr acpi 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver
appeared in
.Nx 1.6 .
