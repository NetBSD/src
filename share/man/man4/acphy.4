.Nd "Driver for Altima AC101, AC101L and AMD Am79c874 10/100 Ethernet PHYs"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "acphy* at mii? phy ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the Altima AC101, AC101L and AMD Am79c874 NetPHY-1LP
10/100 Ethernet PHYs.
These PHYs are often found on low-power Ethernet interfaces, such as MiniPCI
interfaces found in laptops and embedded systems.

The AMD 79c874 is a work-alike (most likely an OEM of the core) of the
Altima part.
