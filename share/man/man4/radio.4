.Sh NAME
.Nm radio
.Nd device-independent radio driver layer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "radio* at az?"
.Cd "radio* at bktr?"
.Cd "radio* at gtp?"
.Cd "radio* at rt?"
.Cd "radio* at rtii?"
.Cd "radio* at sf2r?"
.Cd "radio* at slurm?"
.Cd "radio* at udsbr?"
.Pp
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/ioctl.h
.In sys/radioio.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for various FM radio cards.
It provides an uniform programming interface layer above different underlying
radio hardware drivers.
.Pp
For radio tuner controlling there is a single device file available:
.Pa /dev/radio .
.Pp
The following
.Xr ioctl 2
commands are supported:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Dv RIOCSSRCH (int)
This command assumes that a signal search is required and gives direction
of search to the driver \- 0 to search down and any non-zero value to search up.
.It Dv RIOCGINFO (struct radio_info)
.It Dv RIOCSINFO (struct radio_info)
Get or set the current hardware device information into the struct radio_info
structure.
.Bd -literal
struct radio_info {
	int	mute;
	int	volume;
	int	stereo;
	int	rfreq;	/* reference frequency */
	int	lock;	/* locking field strength */
	uint32_t	freq;	/* in kHz */
	uint32_t	caps;	/* card capabilities */

};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Va mute
field is a boolean.
.Pp
The
.Va volume
field holds the card volume information and can be at most 255.
.Pp
The
.Va stereo
field is a boolean.
.Pp
The
.Va rfreq
holds information about the card reference frequency (not all cards support
this feature).
.Pp
The
.Va lock
field holds information about the card locking field strength during
an automatic search for cards that support this feature.
.Pp
The
.Va freq
field is the frequency in kHz the card is tuned to.
.Pp
The
.Va caps
field is read-only and describes the card capabilities.
The capabilities can have following values:
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_DETECT_STEREO
The device can determine is it tuned to a stereo signal.
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_DETECT_SIGNAL
The device can determine is it tuned or not.
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_SET_MONO
The device capable to forcible set its output to mono.
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_HW_SEARCH
The device can do hardware search.
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_HW_AFC
The device has an internal hardware automatic frequency control.
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_REFERENCE_FREQ
The device allow to change the reference frequency of a received signal.
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_LOCK_SENSITIVITY
The device allow to change the station lock sensitivity used during search
operation.
.It Dv RADIO_CARD_TYPE
Some cards have several different incarnations.
This allow to determine the variant of the card.
Currently not used.
.El
.Pp
The
.Va info
field is read-only and describes the current state of the card \-
tuned/not tuned, stereo signal/mono signal.
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Dv RADIO_INFO_STEREO
Informs whether the device receives a stereo or mono signal.
.It Dv RADIO_INFO_SIGNAL
Informs whether the device receives a valid signal or noise.
