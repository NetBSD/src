.Dt ENIC 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm enic
.Nd eMIPS ExtensibleNIC Ethernet interface driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "enic* at ebus0 addr ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to an
.Tn Ethernet
network via the eMIPS builtin
.Tn eNIC
(Extensible Network Interface Controller - Ethernet) interface.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and
.Tn Ethernet
addresses on the local network.
.Pp
Multicast Ethernet frames are unconditionally received and must be
filtered in software.
.Sh HARDWARE
.Ss emips
The
.Tn ENIC
interface is present on the BEE3 and Xilinx XUP boards.
The interface speed is wired at 1Gbps.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "enic%d: enic_put: no mem?"
The driver could not allocate a transmit buffer, packet was not sent.
.It "enic%d: internal error"
This and other messages are indicative of bad hardware or software
driver coding errors.
