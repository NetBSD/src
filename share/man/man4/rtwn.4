.Sh NAME
.Nm rtwn
.Nd Realtek RTL8188CE/RTL8192CE PCIe IEEE 802.11b/g/n wireless network device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "rtwn* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports PCIe wireless network devices based on the Realtek
RTL8188CE and RTL8192CE chipset.
.Pp
The RTL8188CE is a highly integrated 802.11n adapter that combines a MAC,
a 1T1R capable baseband and an RF in a single chip.
It operates in the 2GHz spectrum only.
.Pp
The RTL8192CE is a highly integrated multiple-in, multiple-out (MIMO)
802.11n adapter that combines a MAC, a 2T2R capable baseband and an
RF in a single chip.
It operates in the 2GHz spectrum only.
.Pp
These are the modes the
.Nm
driver can operate in:
.Bl -tag -width "IBSS-masterXX"
.It BSS mode
Also known as
.Em infrastructure
mode, this is used when associating with an access point, through
which all traffic passes.
This mode is the default.
.It monitor mode
In this mode the driver is able to receive packets without
associating with an access point.
This disables the internal receive filter and enables the card to
capture packets from networks which it wouldn't normally have access to,
or to scan for access points.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured to use
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) or
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK).
WPA is the current encryption standard for wireless networks.
It is strongly recommended that WEP
not be used as the sole mechanism
to secure wireless communication,
due to serious weaknesses in it.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured at runtime with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or on boot with
.Xr ifconfig.if 5 .
.Sh FILES
The driver needs the following firmware files,
which are loaded when an interface is brought up:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It /libdata/firmware/if_rtwn/rtl8192cfw.bin
.It /libdata/firmware/if_rtwn/rtl8192cfwU.bin
.It /libdata/firmware/if_rtwn/rtl8192cfwU_B.bin
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following
.Xr ifconfig.if 5
example configures rtwn0 to join whatever network is available on boot,
using WEP key
.Dq 0x1deadbeef1 ,
channel 11, obtaining an IP address using DHCP:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
nwkey 0x1deadbeef1 chan 11
dhcp
.Ed
.Pp
Join an existing BSS network,
.Dq my_net :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig rtwn0 192.168.1.1 netmask 0xffffff00 nwid my_net
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "rtwn%d: could not read firmware ..."
For some reason, the driver was unable to read the microcode file from the
filesystem.
The file might be missing or corrupted.
.It "rtwn%d: device timeout"
A frame dispatched to the hardware for transmission did not complete in time.
The driver will reset the hardware.
This should not happen.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 5.8
and in
.Nx 8.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Stefan Sperling
.Aq stsp@openbsd.org
for
.Ox
and ported to
.Nx
by
.An NONAKA Kimihiro
.Aq nonaka@NetBSD.org .
It was based on the
.Xr urtwn 4
driver written by
.An Damien Bergamini
.Aq damien.bergamini@free.fr .
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
driver does not support any of the 802.11n capabilities offered by the
adapters.
Additional work is required in
.Xr ieee80211 9
before those features can be supported.
