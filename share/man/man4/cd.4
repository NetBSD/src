.Sh NAME
.Nm cd
.Nd SCSI and ATAPI CD-ROM driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "cd* at scsibus? target ? lun ?"
.Cd "cd1 at scsibus0 target 4 lun 0"
.Cd "cd* at atapibus? drive ? flags 0x0000"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm cd
driver provides support for a Small Computer Systems Interface
.Pq Tn SCSI
bus and Advanced Technology Attachment Packet Interface
.Pq Tn ATAPI
Compact Disc-Read Only Memory
.Pq Tn CD-ROM
drive.
In an attempt to look like a regular disk, the
.Nm
driver synthesizes a partition table, with one partition covering the entire
.Tn CD-ROM .
It is possible to modify this partition table using
.Xr disklabel 8 ,
but it will only last until the
.Tn CD-ROM
is unmounted.
In general the interfaces are similar to those described by
.Xr wd 4
and
.Xr sd 4 .
.Pp
As the
.Tn SCSI
adapter is probed during boot, the
.Tn SCSI
bus is scanned for devices.
Any devices found which answer as `Read-only'
type devices will be `attached' to the
.Nm
driver.
.Pp
For the use of flags with ATAPI devices, see
.Xr wd 4 .
.Pp
The system utility
.Xr disklabel 8
may be used to read the synthesized
disk label
structure, which will contain correct figures for the size of the
.Tn CD-ROM
should that information be required.
.Sh KERNEL CONFIGURATION
Any number of
.Tn CD-ROM
devices may be attached to the system regardless of system
configuration as all resources are dynamically allocated.
.Sh IOCTLS
The following
.Xr ioctl 2
calls which apply to
.Tn SCSI
.Tn CD-ROM
drives are defined
in the header files
.In sys/cdio.h
and
.In sys/disklabel.h .
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width CDIOCREADSUBCHANNEL

.It Dv DIOCSDINFO
.Pq Li "struct disklabel"
Read or write the in-core copy of the disklabel for the
drive.
The disklabel is initialized with information
read from the
.Tn SCSI
inquiry commands, and should be the same as
the information printed at boot.
This structure is defined in
.Xr disklabel 5 .

.Pp
In addition the general
.Xr scsi 4
ioctls may be used with the
.Nm
driver, if used against the `whole disk' partition (i.e.
.Pa /dev/rcd0d
for the bebox and i386 port,
.Pa /dev/rcd0c
for all other ports).
.Sh NOTES
When a
.Tn CD-ROM
is changed in a drive controlled by the
.Nm
driver, then the act of changing the media will invalidate the
disklabel and information held within the kernel.
To stop corruption, all accesses to the device will be discarded
until there are no more open file descriptors referencing the device.
During this period, all new open attempts will be rejected.
When no more open file descriptors reference the device, the first
next open will load a new set of parameters (including disklabel)
for the drive.
.Pp
The audio code in the
.Nm
driver only support
.Tn SCSI-2
standard audio commands.
Because many
.Tn CD-ROM
manufacturers have not followed the standard, there are many
.Tn CD-ROM
drives for which audio will not work.
Some work is planned to support some of the more common `broken'
.Tn CD-ROM
drives; however, this is not yet under way.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver appeared in
.Tn 386BSD 0.1 .
.Sh BUGS
The names of the structures used for the third argument to
.Fn ioctl
were poorly chosen, and a number of spelling errors have survived in
the names of the
.Fn ioctl
commands.
