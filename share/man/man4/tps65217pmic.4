.Sh NAME
.Nm tps65217pmic 
.Nd Texas Instruments TPS65217 Power Management IC driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "tps65217pmic0 at iic? addr 0x24"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides minimal support for the TPS65217 chip and allows reporting
regulated voltages through
.Xr envsys 4 
API.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr envsys 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device first appeared in
.Nx 7.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Radoslaw Kujawa Aq radoslaw.kujawa@gmail.com .
.Sh CAVEATS
The driver can only report current voltage regulator settings.
It can not measure the real voltage, as TPS65217 chip lacks hardware to do
that.

Modifying voltage regulator parameters was deliberately left unimplemented, as
these parameters should only be set at the firmware level.
Setting wrong parameters may result in permanent hardware damange.
.Sh BUGS
Battery and interrupt support is not implemented.
