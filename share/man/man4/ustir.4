.Nm
driver provides support for USB-IrDA bridges based on the SigmaTel STIr4200.

.Xr usb 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver
appeared in
.Nx 1.6 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An David Sainty Aq Mt David.Sainty@dtsp.co.nz .
.Sh BUGS
The STIr4200 cannot notify the driver when it has received data, instead it
has to be continuously polled.  This driver polls (when idle) at a fairly low
rate of 10 times per second, which means that system performance is not overly
affected by rapid polling, but latency is fairly high.
