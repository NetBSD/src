.Nd Vortex86 RDC R6040 Fast Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "vte* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Pp
Configuration of PHYs is necessary.
See
.Xr rdcphy 4 .
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver provides support for RDC R6040 Fast Ethernet controller
which is commonly found on Vortex86 System On a Chip (SoC).
.Pp
The RDC R6040 has integrated 10/100 PHY for 10/100Mbps support in full
or half-duplex.
The controller supports interrupt moderation mechanism, a 64-bit multicast
hash filter, VLAN over-size frame and four station addresses.
The
.Nm
device driver uses three station addresses out of four as perfect
multicast filter.
.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
The following variables are available
.Bl -tag -width "xxxxxx"
.It Va hw.vte.vte<x>.int_rxct
Maximum number of packets to fire RX completion interrupt.
The accepted range is 0 (disable interrupt moderation) to 15, the default is 0.
.It Va hw.vte.vte<x>.int_txct
