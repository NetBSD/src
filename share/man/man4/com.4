.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for NS8250-, NS16450-, and NS16550-based
.Tn EIA
.Tn RS-232C
.Pf ( Tn CCITT
.Tn V.28 )
communications interfaces.
The NS8250 and NS16450 have single character
buffers, and the NS16550 has a 16 character buffer.
.Pp
Input and output for each line may set to one of following baud rates;
50, 75, 110, 134.5, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, 9600,
19200, 38400, 57600, or 115200, or any other baud rate which is a factor
of 115200.
.Pp
The ttyXX devices are traditional dial-in devices; the dtyXX devices are
used for dial-out.
(See
.Xr tty 4 . )
.Pp
.Cd options COM_HAYESP
adds support for the Hayes ESP serial board.
.Pp
.Cd options PPS_SYNC
enables code to use the Data Carrier Detect (DCD) signal line for attachment
to an external precision clock source
.Po
e.g.,
.Tn GPS ,
.Tn CDMA
.Pc
which generates a Pulse Per Second (PPS) signal.
This is used by
.Xr ntpd 8
to discipline the system clock, and more accurately count/measure time.
See
.Xr options 4
for more discussion.
.Pp
With
.Cd options RND_COM
enabled, the
.Nm
driver can be used to collect entropy for the
.Xr rnd 4
entropy pool.
The entropy is generated from interrupt randomness.
.Ss Arm32 specific
If
.Dq flags 1
is specified, the
.Nm
driver will not set the
.Dv MCR_IENABLE
bit on the UART.
This is mainly for use on AST multiport boards, where the
.Dv MCR_IENABLE
bit is used to control whether or not the devices use a shared
interrupt.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver was originally derived from the HP9000/300
.Ic dca
driver.
.Sh BUGS
Data loss is possible on busy systems with unbuffered UARTs at high speed.
.Pp
The name of this driver and the constants which define the locations
of the various serial ports are holdovers from
.Tn DOS .
