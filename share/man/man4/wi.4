WaveLAN/IEEE and PRISM-II 802.11 wireless network driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "wi* at pcmcia? function ?"
.Cd "wi* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Lucent Technologies WaveLAN/IEEE PCCARD adapters
(also known as WaveLAN II cards) and various PCI/MiniPCI/PCCARD adapters which use
Intersil PRISM-II and PRISM-2.5 chipsets.
Note that while Lucent sells both ISA and PCMCIA WaveLAN/IEEE devices,
the ISA product is actually a PCMCIA card in an ISA to PCMCIA bridge adapter.
Consequently, the
.Nm
driver is required for both the ISA and PCMCIA NICs.
Also note that some of the PRISM-II adapters works only at 3.3V, hence
.Xr cardbus 4
support is required for those cards to set VCC correctly,
even though they are 16-bit cards.
.Pp
The core of the WaveLAN/IEEE is the Lucent Hermes controller.
All host/device interaction is via programmed I/O with the Hermes.
The Hermes supports 802.11 and 802.3 frames, power management, BSS, WDS
and ad-hoc operation modes.
The Silver and the Gold cards of the
WaveLAN/IEEE also support WEP.
Unlike the other IEEE 802.11 network cards, the WaveLAN Gold cards
accept 104 bits key (13 characters) for WEP encryption.
The Intersil PRISM-II controller supports WEP as well.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver encapsulates all traffic as 802.11 frames, however
it can receive either 802.11 or 802.3 frames.
Transmit speed is selectable between 1Mbps fixed,
2Mbps fixed or 2Mbps with auto fallback.
For WaveLAN/IEEE Turbo adapters, speeds up to 6Mbps are available.
For WaveLAN/IEEE Turbo 11Mbps adapters and PRISM-II adapters, speeds up to
11Mbps are available.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports configuration of Lucent cards for special ad-hoc operation.
In this mode, the nwid is ignored and stations can communicate among each
other without the aid of an access point.
Note that this mode is specific
to Lucent chips, and not in the IEEE 802.11 specification.
Due to changes
in the implementation of this special ad-hoc mode, Lucent-based cards with
different firmware revisions may not interoperate in this mode.
This mode is no longer the default and must be selected using the
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Pq media option Dq adhoc,flag0
utility.
.Pp
Recent versions of Lucent and PRISM-II firmware support IBSS creation.
IBSS is the standard IEEE 802.11 ad-hoc mode.
In this mode, the nwid should be specified.
At least one node must be able to create IBSS.
The IBSS mode is enabled by
.Dq adhoc
or
.Dq ibss
media option.
IBSS creation is automatically enabled if supported.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver defaults to infrastructure mode (i.e., using an access point).
.Pp
Recent versions of PRISM-II firmware support operating as an 802.11
Access Point.
In this mode, the Access Point station should set the nwid.
This will create a standard 802.11 network, and the Access Point
station will show up in an Access Point scan.
This mode is enabled using the
.Dq hostap
media option.
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8
and
.Xr ifmedia 4 .
