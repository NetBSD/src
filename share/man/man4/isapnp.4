.Sh NAME
.Nm isapnp
.Nd introduction to ISA Plug-and-Play support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "isapnp0 at isa?"
.Pp
An
.Nm
bus can be configured for each supported ISA bus.
.Sh INTRODUCTION
NetBSD provides machine-independent bus support and
drivers for ISA Plug-and-Play (isapnp) autoconfiguration of
PnP-compatible
devices on an ISA bus.
.Sh SUPPORTED DEVICES
.Nx
includes machine-independent ISAPNP drivers, sorted by function
and driver name:
.Pp
.Ss Serial and parallel interfaces
.Bl -tag -width speaker -offset indent -compact
.It com
8250/16450/16550-compatible ISA PnP serial cards and internal modems.
.El
.\"
.Pp
.Ss Network interfaces
.Bl -tag -width speaker -offset indent -compact
.It ep
3com 3c509B Etherlink-III Ethernet interface.
.It le
PCnet-PnP ethernet interfaces basd on the successor to the AMD LANCE chip.
.El
.\"
.Ss Sound cards
.Bl -tag -width speaker -offset indent -compact
.It sb
Soundblaster, Soundblaster 16, and Soundblaster Pro soundcards.
.\" .It gus
.\" Gravis Ultrasound PnP sound cars
.El
.Pp
ISA Plug-and-Play devices also have alternate ISA drivers with
static ISA IO address configuration.
These are listed in 
.Xr isa 4 .
The
.Nm
bus ignores  device that have already been found and configured as
.Xr isa 4
The
.Nm
bus is only effective on machines which lack a PnP BIOS, or  on
which the PnP BIOS has been disabled.
The manual pages for each individual 
.Nm
driver also list
the supported variants on other buses.
