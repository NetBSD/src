.Sh NAME
.Nm isapnp
.Nd introduction to ISA Plug-and-Play support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "isapnp0 at isa?"
.Pp
An
.Nm
bus can be configured for each supported ISA bus.
.Sh INTRODUCTION
.Nx
provides machine-independent bus support and
drivers for ISA Plug-and-Play (isapnp) autoconfiguration of
PnP-compatible
devices on an ISA bus.
.Sh SUPPORTED DEVICES
.Nx
includes machine-independent ISAPNP drivers, sorted by function
and driver name:
.Pp
.Ss SCSI controllers
.Bl -tag -width speaker -offset indent -compact
.It aha
Adapted AHA-154[02] SCSI controller card.
.It aic
Adaptec AHA-1520B SCSI controller card.

.It com
8250/16450/16550-compatible ISA PnP serial cards and internal modems.
.El

.Pp
.Ss Network interfaces
.Bl -tag -width speaker -offset indent -compact
.It ep
3com 3c509B Etherlink-III Ethernet interface.
.It le
PCnet-PnP Ethernet interfaces based on the successor to the AMD LANCE chip.
.It ne

.It tr
TROPIC based token ring interfaces.
.El
.\"
.Ss Sound cards
.Bl -tag -width speaker -offset indent -compact
.It sb
Soundblaster, Soundblaster 16, and Soundblaster Pro sound cards.
.It guspnp
Gravis Ultrasound PnP sound cards.
.It wss
Windows Sound System compatible cards, e.g., most of the cards
with Crystal Semiconductor chips.
.It ym
Yamaha OPL3-SAx sound cards.
.It ess
ESS Technology derived PnP sound cards and devices.
.El
.Pp
ISA Plug-and-Play devices also have alternate ISA drivers with
static ISA IO address configuration.
These are listed in 
.Xr isa 4 .
The
.Nm
bus ignores  device that have already been found and configured as
.Xr isa 4
devices.
The
.Nm
bus is only effective on machines which lack a PnP BIOS, or  on
which the PnP BIOS has been disabled.
The manual pages for each individual 
.Nm
driver also list
the supported front-ends for other buses.
