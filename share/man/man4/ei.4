(Ether1) Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ei* at podulebus0 slot ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The

driver provides access to a 10 Mb/s Ethernet network through an
Acorn

Ethernet card (also known as
.Dq Ether1
after its
.Tn RISC OS
driver).
The card is based on the Intel 82586.

is through links on the board (LK3\(enLK8 and LK10), so there are no media
options available through the driver.
