.Dt ACPITZ 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm acpitz
.Nd ACPI Thermal Zone
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "acpitz* at acpi?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports ACPI Thermal Zones.
.Pp
The temperature can be monitored by the
.Xr envsys 4
API or the
.Xr envstat 8
command.
.Sh EVENTS
The
.Nm
driver knows about the active cooling levels, the current
temperatures, and critical, hot, and passive temperature thresholds
(as supported by the hardware).
The driver is able to send events to
.Xr powerd 8
when the sensor's state has changed.
When a Thermal Zone is critical, a
.Em critical
event will be sent or if the Thermal Zone is hot, a
.Em warning-over
event will be sent to the
.Pa /etc/powerd/scripts/sensor_temperature
script.
.Pp
The critical temperature is the threshold for system shutdown.
Depending on the hardware, the mainboard will take down the system
instantly and no event will have a chance to be sent.
.\" The hot temperature is the temperature threshold for S4 sleep.
.\" S4 is only supported on small subset of machines and is not known to work.
The passive temperature is the passive cooling temperature threshold.
Passive cooling means the Thermal Zone hardware
doesn't have any software control.
On capable hardware, active cooling can power on and off fans, for example.

.Sh BUGS
Any policy control such as fan control is not implemented.
