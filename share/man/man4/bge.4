.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports IPv4 IP, TCP, and UDP checksum offload for receive,
IP checksum offload for transmit, VLAN tag insertion and stripping,
as well as a 256-bit multicast hash filter.
The BCM5717, BCM5718, BCM5723, BCM5754, BCM5755, BCM5761, BCM5764, BCM5784,
BCM5785, BCM5787 and BCM577xx chips also support IPv6 receive TCP/UDP
checksum offload.
The
.Nm
driver supports this feature of the chip.
See
.Xr ifconfig 8
for information on how to enable this feature.
.Pp
The BCM5700, BCM5701, BCM5702, BCM5703, BCM5704, BCM5714, BCM5717, BCM5719,
BCM5720, BCM5780, BCM57765 and BCM57766 also support jumbo frames, which can be
configured via the
interface MTU setting.
Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the
.Xr ifconfig 8
utility configures the adapter to receive and transmit Jumbo frames.
.Pp
The level of interrupt mitigation for received packets can be adjusted
with the
.Li hw.bge.rx_lvl
.Xr sysctl 8
control.
A value of 1 yields a
.Nm
interrupt for every two full-sized Ethernet frames.
Each increment of the value will, roughly, halve receive interrupt rate,
up to a maximum of 5, which interrupts about every 30 to 40 full-sized
TCP segments.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width 1000baseSX
.It Cm autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to the appropriate
.Xr ifconfig.if 5
file.
.It Cm 10baseT
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Ic mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Ic mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 1000baseT
Set 1000baseT operation over twisted pair.
Both
.Cm full-duplex
and
.Cm half-dupex
modes are supported.
.It Cm 1000baseSX
Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation.
Both
.Cm full-duplex
and
.Cm half-duplex
modes are supported.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It Cm full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It Cm half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
.El

.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "bge%d: can't find mem space"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "bge%d: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "bge%d: watchdog timeout -- resetting"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).
