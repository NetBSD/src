.Sh NAME
.Nm wm
.Nd Broadcom BCM570x family Gigabit Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "bge* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Pp
Configuration of PHYs may also be necessary.  See
.Xr mii 4 .
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports Gigabit Ethernet interfaces based on the Broadcom
BCM570x family of Gigabit Ethernet chips.  The interfaces supported by
the
.Nm
driver include:
.Bl -bullet
.It
3Com 3c996-T (10/100/1000baseTX)
.It
Dell PowerEdge 2550 integrated BCM5700 NIC (10/100/1000baseTX)
.It
IBM x235 server integrated BCM5703x NIC (10/100/1000baseTX)
.It
Netgear GA302T (10/100/1000baseTX)
.It
SysKonnect SK-9D21 (10/100/1000baseTX)
.It
SysKonnect SK-9D41 (1000baseSX)
.El
.Pp
The BCM570x family supports IPv4/TCP/UDP checksumming in hardware.  The
.Nm
driver supports this feature of the chip.  See
.Xr ifconfig 8
for information on how to enable this feature.
