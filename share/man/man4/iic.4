.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Tn I2C
is a two-wire bus developed by Philips used for connecting
integrated circuits.
It is commonly used for connecting devices such as EEPROMs,
temperature sensors, fan controllers, real-time clocks, tuners,
and other types of integrated circuits.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides a uniform programming interface layer between
.Tn I2C
master controllers and various
.Tn I2C
slave devices.
Each
.Tn I2C
master controller attaches an
.Nm
framework; several slave devices can then be attached to the
.Nm
bus.
.Pp
All
.Tn I2C
slave devices are uniquely identified by the address on the bus.
The master accesses a particular slave device using its address.
.\" Devices are found on the bus using a sophisticated scanning routine
.\" which attempts to identify commonly available devices.
.\" On other machines (such as sparc64 and macppc) where the machine ROM
.\" supplies a list of I2C devices, that list is used instead.
.Pp
System Management Bus (SMBus) protocol is also supported by emulating
it with the
.Tn I2C
commands.
.Sh SUPPORTED MASTERS
A wide list of I2C masters are supported, among them are:
