.Sh DESCRIPTION
I2C is a two-wire bus developed by Philips used for connecting
integrated circuits.
It is commonly used for connecting devices such as EEPROMs,
temperature sensors, fan controllers, real-time clocks, tuners,
and other types of integrated circuits.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides a uniform programming interface layer between I2C
master controllers and various I2C slave devices.
Each I2C master controller attaches an
.Nm
framework; several slave devices can then be attached to the
.Nm
bus.
.Pp
All I2C slave devices are uniquely identified by the address on the bus.
The master accesses a particular slave device using its address.
.\" Devices are found on the bus using a sophisticated scanning routine
.\" which attempts to identify commonly available devices.
.\" On other machines (such as sparc64 and macppc) where the machine ROM
.\" supplies a list of I2C devices, that list is used instead.
.Pp
System Management Bus (SMBus) protocol is also supported by emulating
it with the I2C commands.
.Sh IOCTLS
The following
.Xr ioctl 2
calls apply to
.Em IIC
devices.
They are defined in the header file
.In dev/i2c/i2c_io.h :
