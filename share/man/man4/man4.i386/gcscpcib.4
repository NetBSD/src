.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the AMD Geode CS5535 and CS5536 Companion chip.
This device contains a number of components, including a PCI-ISA bridge.
Besides the core functionality, the
.Nm
driver implements a 32-bit 3.5 MHz timecounter, a watchdog timer device,
and a GPIO device. The watchdog timer may be configured via the
.Xr watchdog 8
utility and the GPIO pins can be manipulated via the
.Xr gpioctl 8
utility.
