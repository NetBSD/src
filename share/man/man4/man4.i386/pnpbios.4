.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver
appeared in
.Nx 1.5 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
bus provides a different way to attach devices than the real buses
(e.g.,
.Xr isa 4 ) .
The reason to use
.Nm
instead of the real bus is that some machines have weird routings
of, e.g., interrupts.  The exact information about these things can
be found in the BIOS, which is why the
.Nm
bus has a better chance of succeeding with getting it right.
.Pp
Many older BIOS implementations do not support PnP,
and some newer ones do not follow the standards.
