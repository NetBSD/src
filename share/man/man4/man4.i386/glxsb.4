.Sh NAME
.Nm glxsb
.Nd Geode LX Security Block crypto accelerator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "glxsb* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the security block of the Geode LX series processors.
The Geode LX is a member of the AMD Geode family
of integrated x86 system chips.
.Pp
Driven by periodic checks for available data from the generator,
.Nm
supplies entropy to the
.Xr random 4
driver for common usage.
.Pp
.Nm
also supports acceleration of AES-CBC operations for
.Xr crypto 4 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr crypto 4 ,
.Xr i386/intro 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr random 4 ,
.Xr crypto 9
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device first appeared in
.Nx 4.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written for
.Ox
by
.An Tom Cosgrove .
It was ported to
.Nx
by
.An Jared D. McNeill Aq Mt jmcneill@NetBSD.org .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver only provides random numbers and AES acceleration.
Since it does not provide HMACs, IPSec will not currently use it;
it will however be used by OpenSSH.
