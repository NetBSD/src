Parallel port driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.\" XXX this is awful hackery to get it to work right... -- cgd
.Cd "device lpt0 at isa? port" \&"IO_LPT0\&" tty irq 7 vector lptintr
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to parallel ports.  It assumes that
the parallel port controller interrupts the CPU properly.  If
this is not the case, the
.Nm lpa
driver should be used instead.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Pa -compact
.It Pa /dev/lpt0
first parallel port driver
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr lpa 4
.Sh BUGS
There are lots of them, especially in cheap parallel port implementations.
.Pp
This driver could stand a rewrite.
