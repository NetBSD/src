.Sh NAME
.Nm gcscide
.Nd IDE Controller for the AMD CS5535 Companion device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "gcscide* at pci? dev ? function ? flags 0x0000"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the IDE controller of the AMD CS5535 Companion device,
and provides the interface with the hardware for the
.Xr ata 4
driver.
.Pp
The 0x0002 flag forces the
.Nm
driver to disable DMA on chipsets for which DMA would normally be
enabled.
This can be used as a debugging aid, or to work around
problems where the IDE controller is wired up to the system incorrectly.
