.Sh NAME
.Nm gscpcib
.Nd National Semiconductor Geode SC1100 PCI-ISA bridge with GPIO
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "gscpcib* at pci?"
.Cd "isa* at gscpcib?"
.Cd "gpio* at gscpcib?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the National Semiconductor Geode SC1100
System-on-Chip
.Tn PCI-ISA
bridge.
This device is a
.Tn PCI-ISA
bridge, but with some additional sub-devices.
Besides the core
.Xr pcib 4
functionality, the
.Nm
driver provides support for the
.Tn GPIO
interface of this device.
.Pp
The device has 64 I/O pins which can be accessed through the
.Xr gpio 4
framework.
The
.Xr gpioctl 8
program provides a convenient way to manipulate these pins from userland.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr gpio 4 ,
.Xr i386/intro 4 ,
.Xr isa 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr pcib 4 ,
.Xr gpioctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 3.6
and
.Nx 4.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS

The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Alexander Yurchenko Aq Mt grange@openbsd.org
and was ported to
