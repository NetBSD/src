.Sh NAME
.Nm elanpex
.Nd AMD Elan SC520 PCI Exception Instrumentation
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "elansc* at mainbus? bus ?"
.Cd "elanpex* at elansc?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the PCI exception-reporting facilities of the AMD
Elan SC520 microcontroller's integrated PCI host controller.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -ohang
.It Em PCI master exceptions
.Pp
The host controller may originate a transaction of type
.Em %s
on bus address
.Em %x
that fails for the following reasons:
.Bl -diag
.It elanpex0: %s %x master retry timeout
.It elanpex0: %s %x master target abort
.It elanpex0: %s %x master abort
.It elanpex0: %s %x master system error
.It elanpex0: %s %x master received parity error
.It elanpex0: %s %x master detected parity error
.El
.Pp
Transaction types include
.Bl -diag
.It i/o read
.It i/o write
.It memory rd
.It memory wr
.It cfg rd
.It cfg wr
.El
.It Em PCI target exceptions
.Pp
The host controller may be the target of a failed transaction of type
.Em %s
at bus address
.Em %x .
Failures may occur for the following reasons:
.Bl -diag
.It elanpex0: %s %x target delayed txn timeout
.It elanpex0: %s %x target address parity
.It elanpex0: %s %x target data parity
.El
.Pp
Transaction types are alike to failed master exceptions.
