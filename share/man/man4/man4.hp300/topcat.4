.Sh NAME
.Nm topcat
.Nd
.Tn HP98544
98550
.Dq Topcat
and
.Dq Catseye
device interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "topcat* at intio?"
.Cd "topcat* at dio? scode ?"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at topcat?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver is for the
.Tn HP98544 ,
98545 and 98547
.Dq Topcat
and
.Tn HP98548 ,
98549, and 98550
.Dq Catseye
display cards.
This driver merely checks for the existence of the device
and does minimal setup, as it is expected the applications will initialize
the device to their requirements.
The Topcat and Catseye are nearly identical in common usage and only the
Topcat will be referred to from now on.
.Pp
The Topcat display cards are not user configurable.
If one is present on a system, it will always have a frame buffer
address of 0x200000 and a control register address of 0x560000.
These are the
.Tn HP
series 300
.Tn ITE
(Internal
Terminal Emulator) defaults.
The device can also be used as a graphics output
device.
