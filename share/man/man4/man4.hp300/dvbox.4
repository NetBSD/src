.Tn HP98730
.Dq DaVinci
graphics device interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "dvbox* at intio?"
.Cd "dvbox* at dio? scode ?"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at dvbox?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver is for the
.Tn HP98730
and 98731 graphics device, also known as
the DaVinci.
This driver has not been tested with all possible
combinations of frame buffer boards and scan boards installed in the device.
The driver merely checks for the existence of the device and does minimal setup.
.Pp
The DaVinci can be configured at either the
.Dq internal
address
(frame buffer address 0x200000, control register space address 0x560000)
or at an external select code less than 32.
At the internal address it will be the
.Dq preferred
console device.
The hardware installation manual describes the procedure for
setting these values.
