graphics device interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "gbox* at intio?"
.Cd "gbox* at dio? scode ?"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at gbox?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver is for the
.Tn HP98700
and 98710 graphics devices, also known as
the Gatorbox.
The term
.Dq Gator
will often be used, and it is not to be confused with
.Dq Gator
used in reference to an
.Tn HP
9837 or 200/237 machine.
Also, the term Gatorbox is used for the 98700 alone, with the 98701 frame
buffer memory or with the 98710 accelerator installed.
This driver merely
checks for the existence of the device and does minimal setup, as it is
expected the applications will initialize the device to their requirements.
.Pp
The 98700 can be used as the only graphics device on a system, in which case
it will be used as the system console.
It can also be installed as a secondary display device.
For the first case, the
.Tn HP
.Tn 98287A M.A.D.
interface card
should be set to internal control space.
This will put the frame buffer at
the DIO address 0x200000 and the control registers at 0x560000.
At this address it will be the
.Dq preferred
console device (see
.Xr hp300/cons 4 ) .
For use as a secondary device,
the 98287A should be set to frame buffer address 0x300000,
and to an external select code.
.Pp
It should be noted that this configuration will conflict with the 98547
display card which has a 2 megabyte frame buffer starting at address 0x200000.
The 98700 should only be installed as a secondary device in a machine with a
1 bit 98544 display card or 4 bit 98545 card.
The
.%T 98700H Installation Guide
contains further configuration information.
