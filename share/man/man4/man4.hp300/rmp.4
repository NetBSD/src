Remote Maintenance Protocol Family
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "options RMP"
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/socket.h
.In netrmp/rmp.h
.In netrmp/rmp_var.h
.Ft int
.Fn socket AF_RMP SOCK_RAW proto
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Hewlett-Packard's Remote Maintenance Protocol family is a collection
of protocols layered atop
.Tn IEEE  802.3 .
The current implementation of the RMP family provides protocol support only
for the
.Dv SOCK_RAW
socket type.
As a result,
.Xr sendto 2
and
.Xr recvfrom 2
must be used to send and
receive
.Tn RMP
packets.
.Pp
The format of an
.Tn RMP
packet is defined in the include file
.In netrmp/rmp_var.h .
The
.Tn RMP
packet arrives encapsulated in an
.Pf ( Tn HP
extended)
.Tn IEEE  802.2
packet.
The
.Tn IEEE  802.2
packet
is preceded by the kernel address of an
.Ar ifnet struct
which is used to `route' a packet out the same interface it
arrived on.
Outgoing packets are encapsulated in a standard
.Tn IEEE  802.3
packet, while incoming packets have this information stripped away.
.Sh ADDRESSING
.Tn RMP
.Pf ( Tn IEEE
802.3) addresses are 6 octets in length (48 bytes).
Sockets in the Remote Maintenance Protocol family use the following
addressing structure:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct sockaddr_rmp {
	short		srmp_family;
	u_char		srmp_dhost[6];
};
.Ed
.Sh PROTOCOLS
The
.Tn RMP
protocol family supported by the operating system
currently consists of the Boot Protocol
.Pq Em proto= Ns Dv RMPPROTO_BOOT .
Unfortunately, we have no documentation on the Remote Maintenance
Protocol and only sketchy information about the Boot Protocol.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
protocol interface
.Ud
.Sh BUGS
.Bl -bullet
.It
The
.Tn HP ROM
uses
.Tn IEEE
802.3 (as opposed to Ethernet) packets.  While the
kernel heuristically recognizes these packets, a more general mechanism
for doing so should be provided.
.It
The
.Tn HP ROM
uses a multicast address when first trying to locate boot
servers.  While the Ethernet [sic] board is programmed to recognize
this particular multicast address (9:0:9:0:0:4), a more general
mechanism for doing so should be provided.
.It
The kernel supports only
.Tn RAW
sockets for the
.Tn RMP
protocol.
This is either a bug or a feature, since the kernel is smaller at the
price of greater complexity in the server.
.It
There is no support for
.Xr bind 2 Ns 'ing
an address in the
.Tn RMP
domain.
Something like an
.Dv RMPADDR_ANY
should be provided to prevent more than one
.Xr rbootd 8
server from running at the same time.
