98628A serial communications link
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "dcl0 at dio? scode ? flags 0x1"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 98628A is a buffered
.Tn EIA
.Tn RS-232C
.Pf ( Tn CCITT
.Tn V.28 )
communications interface.
It has one port with full modem control.
.Pp
Input and output for each line may set to one of following baud rates;
0, 50, 75, 110, 134.5, 150, 200, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800,
9600, 19200.
.Pp
An optional argument
.Ar flags
may be set to 1 if the line should be treated as hard-wired with
carrier always present, or to 0 if modem control is desired.
.Pp
Use
.Tn HP
cable "98626 & 98628 opts.002,
.Tn RS232-C
.Tn DCE CABLE ,
5061-4216" to attach non-modem devices.
Use
.Tn HP
cable "98626 & 98628 opts.001,
.Tn RS232-C
.Tn DTE CABLE ,
5061-4215" to attach modems.
.Pp
The 98628A has a 256 byte input silo and a 256 output silo. Input interrupts
happen on a per character basis.
.Pp
The high water and low water marks in the kernel tty routines are completely
inappropriate for a device like this with a large input buffer.  Don't use
tandem mode if possible.  A fast system can handle input at 19.2K baud without
receive overflow.
.Pp
For output to devices that make heavy use of
.Tn XON/XOFF
a write size of less
than 256 will improve performance marginally.

device is not actually supported in

This man page is only for information purposes in case someone wishes
to port the driver from 4.3BSD.
.Pp
Breaks received at a faster rate than 1 break every second will be
recognized as a single break.
.Pp
Console use is not supported.
.Pp
The
.Tn RS-422/423/499 ,
.Tn MTS-DSN/DL
modes of the card are not supported.
