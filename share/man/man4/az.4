.Sh NAME
.Nm az
.Nd Aztech/PackardBell radio card device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "az0    at isa? port 0x350"
.Cd "az1    at isa? port 0x358"
.Cd "radio* at az?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Aztech/PackardBell radio cards.
.Pp
The Aztech/PackardBell cards are stereo FM tuners that allow tuning
in the 87.5-108.0 MHz range.
They are capable of reporting signal status (tuned/not tuned, stereo/mono
signal) and forcing audio output to mono.
.Pp
The Aztech cards use only one I/O port.
The I/O port is set by the driver to the value specified in the configuration
file.
The I/O port must be one of
0x350 and 0x358.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr isa 4 ,
.Xr radio 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Ox 3.0
and
.Nx 1.6 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An "Vladimir Popov"
and
.An "Maxim Tsyplakov" .
The man page was written by
.An "Vladimir Popov" .
.Sh BUGS
It is impossible to determine to which frequency the card is tuned.
Thus, the driver will report an internally stored value even if it is not
correct (changed by some program that uses direct port access).
