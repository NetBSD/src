.Sh NAME
.Nm mca
.Nd introduction to machine-independent MCA bus support and drivers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "mca0 at mainbus?"
.Pp
.Cd options MCAVERBOSE
.Pp
Machine-dependent; depends on the bus topology and
.Tn MCA
bus interface of your system. Typical
.Tn MCA
buses are connected directly to the main system bus.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nx
includes a machine-independent
.Tn MCA
bus subsystem and several machine-independent
.Tn MCA
device drivers.
.Sh HARDWARE
.Nx
includes machine-independent
.Tn MCA
drivers, sorted by device type and driver name:
