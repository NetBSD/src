The STP2002 family supports hardware checksumming to assist in computing
IPv4 TCP/UDP checksums.
The
.Nm
driver supports this feature of the chip.
See
.Xr ifconfig 8
for information on how to enable this feature.

.Sh BUGS
Connecting a MII transceiver on those cards that support it will cause the
RJ45 connector to be detected as PHY instance 1, instead of the default
instance 0.
