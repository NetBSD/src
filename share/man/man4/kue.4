.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB
.Tn Ethernet
adapters based on the Kawasaki LSI KL5KLUSB101B chipset.
.Pp
The KL5KLUSB101B supports a 128-entry multicast filter, single perfect
filter entry for the station address and promiscuous mode.
Packets are
received and transmitted over separate USB bulk transfer endpoints.
.Pp
The Kawasaki adapter supports only 10Mbps half-duplex mode, hence there
are no
.Xr ifmedia 4
modes to select.
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
See
.Xr usbnet 4
for diagnostics.

.Nx 1.5 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Bill Paul
.Aq wpaul@ee.columbia.edu .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver does not accumulate

collisions statistics because the Kawasaki firmware does not appear to
maintain any internal statistics.
