.Sh NAME
.Nm btuart
.Nd Bluetooth HCI UART (H4) driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd pseudo-device btuart
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides a
.Xr tty 4
line discipline to send and receive Bluetooth packets over a serial line,
as described in the
.Qo
Bluetooth Host Controller Interface
.Bq Transport Layer
specification, Vol 4 part A.
.Qc
.Pp
The
.Nm
sets the baud rate for that by vendor specific or other command.
.Pp
Different modules require different handling.
The connected modules type can be set with
.Xr ioctl 2
calls:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxx
.It Dv BTUART_HCITYPE Fa (int)
