.Sh NAME
.Nm systm
.Nd access
to general kernel functionality from Lua
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "local systm = require 'systm'"
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width XXXX -compact
.It Dv systm.print(msg)
.It Dv systm.print_nolog(msg)
.It Dv systm.uprint(msg)
.It Dv systm.aprint_normal(msg)
.It Dv systm.aprint_naive(msg)
.It Dv systm.aprint_verbose(msg)
.It Dv systm.aprint_debug(msg)
.It Dv systm.aprint_error(msg)
.It Dv count = systm.aprint_get_error_count()
.It Dv systm.panic(msg)
.El
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
Lua binding provides access to general kernel functionality like printing
messages on the console.
The
.Em systm.aprint
functions are meant to be using during kernel autoconfiguration.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width XXXX -compact
.It Dv systm.print(msg)
Send
.Ar msg
to the console.
.Pp
.It Dv systm.print_nolog(msg)
The
.Fn systm.print_nolog
function is identical to the
.Fn systm.print
function,
except is does not send
.Ar msg
to the system log.
.Pp
.It Dv systm.uprint(msg)
Send
.Ar msg
to the current process's controlling tty.
.Pp
.It Dv systm.aprint_normal(msg)
Send
.Ar msg
to the console unless AB_QUIET is set.
Always sends to the log.
.Pp
.It Dv systm.aprint_naive(msg)
Send
.Ar msg
to the console only if AB_QUIET is set.
Never sends to the log.
.Pp
.It Dv systm.aprint_verbose(msg)
Send
.Ar msg
to the console only if AB_VERBOSE is set.
Always sends to the log.
.Pp
.It Dv systm.aprint_debug(msg)
Send
.Ar msg
to the console and the log only if AB_DEBUG is set.
.Pp
.It Dv systm.aprint_error(msg)
Like
.Fn systm.aprint_normal ,
but also keeps track of the number of times called.
This allows a subsystem to report the number of errors that occurred during a
quiet or silent initialization phase.
.Pp
.It Dv count = systm.aprint_get_error_count()
The
.Fn systm.aprint_get_error_count
function reports the number of errors and
resets the counter to 0.
.Pp
.It Dv systm.panic(msg)
The
.Fn systm.panic
function terminates the
.Nx
system.
The message
.Ar msg
is printed to the console and saved in the variable
.Em panicstr
for later retrieval via core dump inspection.
A newline character is added at the end automatically.
.El
.Sh VARIABLES
Upon initialisation, the
.Nm
module sets the following variables with the values of the corresponding kernel
variable:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width XXXX -compact
.It Dv systm.copyright
.It Dv systm.cpu_model
.It Dv systm.machine
.It Dv systm.machine_arch
.It Dv systm.osrelease
.It Dv systm.ostype
.It Dv systm.kernel_ident
.It Dv systm.version
.It Dv systm.ncpu
