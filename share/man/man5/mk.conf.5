.Sh NAME
.Nm mk.conf
.Nd make configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file overrides various parameters used during the build of the system.
.Pp
Listed below are the
.Nm
variables that may be set, the values to which each may be set,
a brief description of what each variable does, and a reference to
relevant manual pages.
.Ss NetBSD System variables
.Bl -tag -width MKDYNAMICROOT
.It Sy NETBSDSRCDIR
The path to the top level of the NetBSD sources.
If
.Xr make 1
is run from within the NetBSD source tree, the default is the top
level of that tree (as determined by the presence of
.Pa build.sh
and
.Pa tools/ ) ,
otherwise
.Sy BSDSRCDIR
will be used.
.It Sy BSDOBJDIR
The real path to the
.Sq obj
tree for the NetBSD source tree.
Default:
.Pa /usr/obj .
.It Sy BSDSRCDIR
The real path to the NetBSD source tree.
Default:
.Pa /usr/src .
.It Sy BUILD
If defined,
.Sq "make install"
checks that the targets in the source directories are up-to-date and
re-makes them if they are out of date, instead of blindly trying to install
out of date or non-existent targets.
.It Sy COPTS
Extra options for the C compiler.
Should be appended to (e.g.,
.Sy COPTS+=-g ) ,
rather than explicitly set.
.It Sy MANZ
Install manual pages compressed with
.Xr gzip 1 .
.It Sy MKCATPAGES
If
.Sq no ,
don't build or install the formatted manual pages.
.It Sy MKDOC
If
.Sq no ,
don't build or install the miscellaneous documentation.
.It Sy MKDYNAMICROOT
If
.Sq no ,
link programs in
.Pa /bin
and
.Pa /sbin
statically.
Otherwise, link everything dynamically,
and install shared libraries required by
.Pa /bin
and
.Pa /sbin
and the shared linker
.Xr ld.elf_so 1
into
.Pa /lib .
.It Sy MKINFO
If
.Sq no ,
don't build or install the TeXinfo Info documentation.
.It Sy MKLINT
If
.Sq no ,
don't build or install the lint libraries.
.It Sy MKMAN
If
.Sq no ,
don't build or install the manual pages.
Sets
.Sy MKCATPAGES=no .
.It Sy MKNLS
If
.Sq no ,
don't build or install the NLS (Native Language Support) files.
.It Sy MKOBJ
If
.Sq no ,
don't create objdirs.
.It Sy MKPIC
If
.Sq no ,
don't build or install shared libraries.
.It Sy MKPICINSTALL
If
.Sq no ,
don't install the
.Sq *_pic.a
libraries.
.It Sy MKPROFILE
If
.Sq no ,
don't build or install the
.Sq *_p.a
profiling libraries.
.It Sy MKSHARE
If
.Sq no ,
set
.Sy MKCATPAGES=no ,
.Sy MKDOC=no ,
.Sy MKINFO=no ,
.Sy MKMAN=no ,
.Sy MKNLS=no .
.It Sy OBJMACHINE
If defined, creates objdirs of the form
.Pa obj.\*[Lt]arch\*[Gt] ,
where
.Sq \*[Lt]arch\*[Gt]
is the current architecture (as per
.Sq "uname -m" ) .
.It Sy UPDATE
If defined,
.Sq "make install"
only installs targets that are more recently modified in the source
directories that their installed counterparts.
.It Sy UNPRIVED
If defined,
.Sq "make install"
will not attempt to set the ownership or permissions of the target
file, and will instead attempt to log the information to
.Pa ${DESTDIR}/METALOG .
.El
.Ss pkgsrc system variables
Please see
.Xr packages 7
for more variables used internally by the package system and
.Pa ${PKGSRCDIR}/mk/bsd.pkg.defaults.mk
