If
.Xr make 1
is run from within the
.Nx
source tree, the default is the top

.Pa build.sh
and
.Pa tools/ ) ,
otherwise
.Sy BSDSRCDIR
will be used.
.
.It Sy BSDOBJDIR
The real path to the
.Sq obj
tree for the

.DFLT
.Pa /usr/src
.
.It Sy BUILD
If defined,
.Sq "make install"
checks that the targets in the source directories are up-to-date and
re-makes them if they are out of date, instead of blindly trying to install

names and hard links.

will be built and installed during a build.
.DFLTy
.Pp

is used during the generation of the distribution tar files to ensure
that the appropriate file ownership is stored.
.DFLTn
.
.It Sy MKUPDATE
.YorN
Indicates whether all install operations intended to write to

phase if the destination files are up-to-date.
This also has implications on full builds (see next subsection).
.DFLTn
.
.It Sy MKYP
.YorN
Indicates whether the YP (NIS) infrastructure
(libraries and support programs) is built.
.DFLTy
.
.It Sy OBJMACHINE

layout will be written at the end of a
.Dq make release .
.DFLTu
.Pp
.Em Note :
.Sy build.sh
will provide a default of
.Pa releasedir
(in the top-level
.Sy .OBJDIR )
unless run in
.Sq expert
mode
.
.It Sy TOOLDIR
Directory to hold the host tools, once built.
This directory should be unique to a given host system and
.Nx
source tree.
(However, multiple targets may share the same
.Sy TOOLDIR ;
the target-dependent files have unique names.)
If unset, a default based
on the
.Xr uname 1
information of the host platform will be created in the
.Sy .OBJDIR
of
.Pa src .
.DFLTu
.
.It Sy USETOOLS
Indicates whether the tools specified by
.Sy TOOLDIR
should be used as part of a build in progress.

if cross-compiling.
.Bl -tag -width "never"
.It Sy yes
Use the tools from
.Sy TOOLDIR .
.It Sy no
Do not use the tools from
.Sy TOOLDIR ,
but refuse to build native compilation tool components that are
version-specific for that tool.
.It Sy never
Do not use the tools from
.Sy TOOLDIR ,
even when building native tool components.
This is similar to the traditional
.Nx
build method, but does
.Em not
verify that the compilation tools in use are up-to-date enough in order
to build the tree successfully.
This may cause build or runtime problems when building the whole
.Nx
source tree.
.El
.DFLT
.Dq yes
if building all or part of a whole
.Nx
source tree (detected automatically);
.Dq no
otherwise (to preserve traditional semantics of the
.Aq bsd.*.mk
.Xr make 1
include files).
