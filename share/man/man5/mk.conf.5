.Nd make configuration file
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file overrides various parameters used during the build of the system.
.Pp
Listed below are the
.Nm
variables that may be set, the values to which each may be set,
a brief description of what each variable does, and a reference to
relevant manual pages.
.
.Ss NetBSD System variables
.
.de YorN
Can be set to
.Dq yes
or
.Dq no .
..
.de DFLT
.Pp
.Em Default :
..
.de DFLTu
.DFLT
Unset.
..
.de DFLTy
.DFLT
.Dq yes
..
.de DFLTn
.DFLT
.Dq no
..
.Bl -tag -width MKDYNAMICROOT
.
.It Sy NETBSDSRCDIR
The path to the top level of the
.Nx
sources.
If
.Xr make 1
is run from within the
.Nx
source tree, the default is the top
level of that tree (as determined by the presence of
.Pa build.sh
and
.Pa tools/ ) ,
otherwise
.Sy BSDSRCDIR
will be used.
.
.It Sy BSDOBJDIR
The real path to the
.Sq obj
tree for the
.Nx
source tree.
.DFLT
.Pa /usr/obj
.
.It Sy BSDSRCDIR
The real path to the
.Nx
source tree.
.DFLT
.Pa /usr/src
.
.It Sy BUILD
If defined,
.Sq "make install"
checks that the targets in the source directories are up-to-date and
re-makes them if they are out of date, instead of blindly trying to install
out of date or non-existent targets.
.DFLTu
.
.It Sy BUILDID
Identifier for the build.
The identifier will be appended to
object directory names, and can be consulted in the
.Xr make 1
configuration file in order to set additional build parameters,
such as compiler flags.
.DFLTu
.
.It Sy COPTS
Extra options for the C compiler.
Should be appended to (e.g.,
.Sy COPTS+=-g ) ,
rather than explicitly set.
Note that
.Sy CPUFLAGS ,
not
.Sy COPTS ,
should be used for
compiler flags that select CPU-related options.
Also note that
.Sy CFLAGS
should never be set in
.Nm .
.
.It Sy CPUFLAGS
Additional flags passed to the compiler/assembler to select
CPU instruction set options, CPU tuning options, etc.
Such options should not be specified in
.Sy COPTS ,
because some parts of the build process need to override
CPU-related compiler options.
.
.It Sy DESTDIR
Directory to contain the built
.Nx
system.
If set, special options are passed to the compilation tools to
prevent their default use of the host system's
.Sy /usr/include , /usr/lib ,
and so forth.
This pathname should
.Em not
end with a slash
.Pq /
character (for installation into the system's root directory, set
.Sy DESTDIR
to an empty string).
The directory must reside on a file system which supports long file
names and hard links.
.DFLT
Empty string if
.Sy USETOOLS
is
.Dq yes ;
unset otherwise.
.Pp
.Em Note :
.Sy build.sh
will provide a default of
.Pa destdir. Ns Sy MACHINE
(in the top-level
.Sy .OBJDIR )
unless run in
.Sq expert
mode
.
.It Sy MAKEVERBOSE
Level of verbosity of status messages.
Supported values:
.Bl -tag -width xxx
.It 0
No descriptive messages or commands executed by
.Xr make 1
are shown.
.It 1
Brief messages are shown describing what is being done,
but the actual commands executed by
.Xr make 1
are not displayed.
.It 2
Descriptive messages are shown as above (prefixed with a
.Sq # ) ,
and ordinary commands performed by
.Xr make 1
are displayed.
.It 3
In addition to the above, all commands performed by
.Xr make 1
are displayed, even if they would ordinarily have been hidden
through use of the
.Dq \&@
prefix in the relevant makefile.
.It 4
In addition to the above, commands executed by
.Xr make 1
are traced through use of the
.Xr sh 1
.Dq Fl x
flag.

.Sy TOOLDIR ,
but refuse to build native compilation tool components that are
version-specific for that tool.
.It Sy never
Do not use the tools from
.Sy TOOLDIR ,
even when building native tool components.
This is similar to the traditional
.Nx
build method, but does
.Em not
verify that the compilation tools in use are up-to-date enough in order
to build the tree successfully.
This may cause build or runtime problems when building the whole
.Nx
source tree.
.El
.DFLT
.Dq yes
if building all or part of a whole
.Nx
source tree (detected automatically);
.Dq no
otherwise (to preserve traditional semantics of the
