.Sh NAME
.Nm utmpx ,
.Nm wtmpx ,
.Nm lastlogx
.Nd user accounting database
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In utmpx.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
In contrast to
.Pa utmp
and
.Pa wtmp ,
the extended databases in
.Pa utmpx
and
.Pa wtmpx
reserve more space for logging hostnames, and also
information on a process' ID, termination signal and exit status.
.Pp
The
.Aq Pa utmpx.h
header defines the structures and functions for logging user.
Currently logged in users are tracked in
.Pa /var/run/utmpx ,
a list of all logins and logouts, as well as all shutdowns, reboots
and date changes, is kept in
.Pa /var/log/wtmpx ,
and the last login of each user is noted in
.Pa /var/log/lastlogx .
.Pp
The interface to the
.Nm utmpx
file is described in
.Xr getutxent 3 .
.Pp
The
.Nm wtmpx
file can grow rapidly on busy systems, and is normally rotated with
.Xr newsyslog 8 .
.Pp
In the event of a date change, a shutdown, or a reboot, the following
items are logged in the
.Nm wtmpx
file:
.Bl -tag -width shutdownxx -compact -offset indent
.It Li date
The system time has been manually or automatically updated by
.Xr date 1 .
The command name
.Em date
is recorded in the field
.Fa ut_name .
In the field
.Fa ut_line ,
the character
.Ql \\*(Ba
indicates the time prior to the change, and the character
.Ql \&{
indicates the new time.
.It Li reboot
.It Li shutdown
A system reboot or shutdown has been initiated.
The character
.Ql \&~
is placed in the field
.Fa ut_line ,
and
.Li reboot
or
.Li shutdown
in the field
.Fa ut_name
(see
.Xr shutdown 8
and
.Xr reboot 8 ) ,
using
.Xr logwtmpx 3 .
