.Sh NAME
.Nm ucontext
.Nd user context
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include \*[Lt]ucontext.h\*[Gt]
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm ucontext_t
is a structure type which is used to describe the context of a
thread of control within the execution of a process.
.Pp
.Nm ucontext_t
includes the following members:
.Bd -literal -offset "XXXXXXXX"
ucontext_t *  uc_link
sigset_t      uc_sigmask
stack_t       uc_stack
mcontext_t    uc_mcontext
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fa uc_link
member points to the context that will be resumed after the function
specified when modifying a context using
.Xr makecontext 3
has returned.
If
.Fa uc_link
is a null pointer, then the context is the main context,
and the process will exit with an exit status of 0 upon return.
.Pp
The
.Fa uc_sigmask
member is the set of signals that are blocked when the context is
activated.
Further information can be found in
.Xr sigprocmask 2 .
.Pp
The
.Fa uc_stack
member defines the stack used by the context.
Further information can be found in
.Xr sigaltstack 2 .
.Pp
The
.Fa uc_mcontext
member defines the machine state associated with the context;
it may consist of general registers, floating point registers
and other machine-specific infomation.
Its description is beyond the scope of this manual page;
portable applications should not access this structure member.
