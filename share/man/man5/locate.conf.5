.Sh NAME
.Nm locate.conf
.Nd locate database configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm locate.conf
file specifies the behavior of
.Xr locate.updatedb 8 ,
which creates the
.Xr locate 1
database.
.Pp
The
.Nm
file contains a list of newline separated records,
each of which is composed of a keyword and arguments,
which are separated by white space.
Lines beginning with
.Dq #
are treated as comments and ignored.
However, a
.Dq #
in the middle of a line does not start comment.
.Pp
The configuration options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXX
.It Sy ignore Ar pattern ...
Ignore files or directories.
When building the database,
do not descend into files or directories
which match one of the specified patterns.
The matched files or directories are not stored to the database.
.Pp
Default: Not specified.
.It Sy ignorecontents Ar pattern ...
Ignore contents of directories.
When building the database,
do not descend into files or directories
which match one of the specified patterns.
The matched files or directories themselves are stored to the database.
.Pp
Default: Not specified.
.It Sy ignorefs Ar type ...
Ignore file system by type,
adding
.Ar type
to the default list.
When building the database,
do not descend into file systems which are of the specified
.Ar type .
The mount points are not stored to the database.
If a
.Dq \&!
is prepended to
.Ar type ,
the meaning is negated,
that is, ignore file systems which do not have the type.
As a special case, if
.Dq none
is specified for
.Ar type ,
the
.Sy ignorefs
list is cleared and all file systems are traversed.
.Pp
.Ar type
is used as an argument to
.Xr find 1
.Fl fstype .
The
.Xr sysctl 8
command can be used to find out the types of file systems
that are available on the system:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
sysctl vfs.generic.fstypes
.Ed
.Pp
Default: !local cd9660 fdesc kernfs procfs
.It Sy searchpath Ar directory ...
Specify base directories to be put in the database.
.Pp
Default: /
.It Sy workdir Ar directory
Specify the working directory of locate.updatedb,
in which a temporary file is placed.
The temporary file is a list of all files,
and you should specify a directory that has enough space to hold it.
.Pp
Default: /tmp
.El
.Pp
Refer to
.Xr find 1
for the details of
.Ar pattern

.Fl path
expression)
and
.Ar type
(see
.Fl fstype
expression).
