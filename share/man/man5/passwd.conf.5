.Sh NAME
.Nm passwd.conf
.Nd password encryption configuration file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Pa /etc/passwd.conf
file, consisting of
.Dq stanzas ,
describes the configuration of the password cipher used
to encrypt local or YP passwords.
.Pp
There are default, user and group specific stanzas.
If no user or group
stanza to a specific option is available, the default stanza
is used.
.Pp
To differentiate between user and group stanzas, groups are prefixed
with a single colon
.Pq Sq \&: .
.Pp
Some fields and their possible values that can appear in this file are:
.Bl -tag -width localcipher
.It Sy localcipher
The cipher to use for local passwords.
.Pp
Possible values are:
.Dq old ,
.Dq newsalt,<rounds> ,
.Dq md5 ,
.Dq sha1,<rounds> ,
and
.Dq blowfish,<rounds> .
For
.Dq newsalt
the value of rounds is a 24-bit integer with a minimum of 7250 rounds.
For
.Dq sha1
the value of rounds is a 32-bit integer, 0 means use the default
of 24680.
For
.Dq blowfish
the value can be between 4 and 31.
It specifies the base 2 logarithm of the number of rounds.
.Pp
If not specified, the default value is
.Dq old .
.It Sy ypcipher
The cipher to use for YP passwords.
.Pp
The possible values are the same as for localcipher.
.Pp
If not specified, the default value is
.Dq old .
.El
.Pp
To retrieve information from this file use
.Xr pw_getconf 3 .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/passwd.conf -compact
.It Pa /etc/passwd.conf
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Use SHA1 as the local cipher and old-style DES as the YP cipher.
Use blowfish with 2^5 rounds for root:
.Bd -literal
 default:
      localcipher = sha1
      ypcipher = old

 root:
      localcipher = blowfish,5

.Xr pwhash 1 ,
.Xr pw_getconf 3 ,
.Xr passwd 5
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
configuration file first appeared in
.Nx 1.6 .
.Pp
The default value of
.Sy localcipher
was set to
.Dq sha1
in
.Pa /etc/passwd.conf
starting from
.Nx 6.0 .
