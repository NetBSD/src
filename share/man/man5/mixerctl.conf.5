.Sh NAME
.Nm mixerctl.conf
.Nd audio mixer configuration file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Pa /etc/mixerctl.conf
file consists of
.Xr mixerctl 1
variables to set at boot time.
Each line of
.Nm
has the following format:
.Dl variable=value
.Pp
To generate a
.Nm
from the current mixer settings, execute:
.Dl Ic mixerctl -a > /etc/mixerctl.conf
.Pp
Set
.Sy mixerctl
to YES in
.Xr rc.conf 5
to have the variables set at boot time.
Additionally, you can have the settings saved
and restored for the devices of your choice by listing them in
.Sy mixerctl_mixers
in
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
