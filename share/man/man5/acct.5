.Sh NAME
.Nm acct
.Nd execution accounting file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/acct.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The kernel maintains the following
.Fa acct
information structure for all
processes. If a process terminates, and accounting is enabled,
the kernel calls the
.Xr acct_process 9
function call to prepare and append the record
to the accounting file.
.Bd -literal
/*
 * Accounting structures; these use a comp_t type which is a 3 bits base 8
 * exponent, 13 bit fraction ``floating point'' number.  Units are 1/AHZ
 * seconds.
 */
typedef uint16_t comp_t;

struct acct {
	char	  ac_comm[16];	/* name of command */
	comp_t	  ac_utime;	/* user time */
	comp_t	  ac_stime;	/* system time */
	comp_t	  ac_etime;	/* elapsed time */
	time_t	  ac_btime;	/* starting time */
	uid_t	  ac_uid;	/* user id */
	gid_t	  ac_gid;	/* group id */
	uint16_t  ac_mem;	/* memory usage average */
	comp_t	  ac_io;	/* count of IO blocks */

.Ed
.Pp
If a terminated process was created by an
.Xr execve 2 ,
the name of the executed file (at most ten characters of it)
is saved in the field
.Fa ac_comm
and its status is saved by setting one of more of the following flags in
.Fa ac_flag :
.Dv AFORK ,
.Dv ACORE ,
and
.Dv AXSIG .
.Pp
The
.Dv ASU
flag is not recorded anymore because with the switch to
.Xr kauth 9 ,
the superuser model is optional and passing the affected process to every
authorization call in order to record
.Dv ASU
in
.Fa p_acflag ,
would require many source changes and would not reflect reality because
the authorization decision might not have been done based on the 
.Xr secmodel_suser 9 
model.
.Pp
The
.Dv ACOMPAT
flag was never recorded in
.Nx ;
we could consider setting when the a process is running under emulation,
but this is not currently done.
.Pp
Both the
.Dv ASU
and the
.Dv ACOMPAT
flags are retained for source compatibility.
