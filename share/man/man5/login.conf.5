.Sh NAME
.Nm login.conf
.Nd login class capability data base
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm login.conf
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm login.conf
file describes the various attributes of login classes.
A login class determines what styles of authentication are available
as well as session resource limits and environment setup.
While designed primarily for the
.Xr login 1
program,
it is also used by other programs, e.g.,
.Xr rexecd 8 ,
which need to set up a user environment.
.Pp
The class to be used is normally determined by the
.Li class
field in the password file (see
.Xr passwd 5 ) .
The class is used to look up a corresponding entry in the
.Pa login.conf
file.
A special class called
.Dq default
will be used (if it exists) if the field in the password file is empty.
.Sh CAPABILITIES
Refer to
.Xr capfile 5
for a description of the file layout.
An example entry is:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
classname|Description entry:\\
	:capability=value:\\
	:booleancapability:\\
		\&.\&.\&.
	:lastcapability=value:
.Ed
.Pp
All entries in the
.Nm login.conf
file are either boolean or use a `=' to separate the capability
from the value.
The types are described after the capability table.

The resource limit entries
.Sy ( coredumpsize ,
.Sy cputime ,
.Sy datasize ,
.Sy filesize ,
.Sy maxproc ,
.Sy memorylocked ,
.Sy memoryuse ,
.Sy openfiles ,
.Sy sbsize ,
and
.Sy stacksize )
actually specify both the maximum and current limits (see
.Xr getrlimit 2 ) .
The current limit is the one normally used,
although the user is permitted to increase the current limit to the
maximum limit.
The maximum and current limits may be specified individually by appending
a
.Sq Sy \-max
or
.Sq Sy \-cur
to the capability name (e.g.,
.Sy openfiles-max
and
.Sy openfiles-cur Ns No ) .
.Pp
.Nx
will never define capabilities which start with
.Li x-
or
.Li X- ;
these are reserved for external use (unless included through contributed
software).
.Pp
The argument types are defined as:
.Bl -tag -width programxx
