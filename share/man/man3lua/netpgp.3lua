.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
Lua binding provides access to functionality availabile in
.Xr libnetpgp 3 .
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example code demonstrates the process of encrypting, decrypting,
signing, and verifying a file, in a single script.
.Bd -literal
local netpgp = require 'netpgp'
btc = netpgp.new()
netpgp.setvar(btc, "need seckey", 1)
netpgp.init(btc)

netpgp.encrypt_file(btc, "scratch", "scratch.gpg", "armoured")
netpgp.decrypt_file(btc, "scratch.gpg", "itch", "armoured")
netpgp.sign_file(btc, "scratch", "scratch.asc", "armoured", "detached")
netpgp.verify_file(btc, "scratch.asc", "armoured")
