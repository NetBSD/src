.Sh NAME
.Nm delay ,
.Nm DELAY
.Nd microsecond delay
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.Ft void
.Fn delay "unsigned int us"
.Ft void
.Fn DELAY "unsigned int us"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Wait approximately
.Fa us
microseconds.
.Pp
The delay is implemented as a machine loop, preventing events other than
interrupt handlers for unmasked interrupts to run.
.Fn DELAY
is reentrant (doesn't modify any global kernel or machine state) and is
safe to use in interrupt or process context.
.Pp
For long delays, condition variables
should be considered, however they can only be used from process context
and their resolution is limited by the system clock frequency.
