.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Machine-independent kernel code adapts to differeces in hardware
capabilities provided by the machine-dependent parts of the kernel.
A port declares its capabilities by definining various
.Li __HAVE_ Ns Ar feature
macros.
This manual page provides an index of such macros with pointers to
other manual pages in the kernel section that provide all the relevant
details.

.
.\" ---------
.It Dv __HAVE_MUTEX_STUBS Pq Xr mutex 9
The port provides fast path mutex enter and exit stubs.
.
.\" ---------
.It Dv __HAVE_PREEMPTION Pq Xr cpu_need_resched 9
The port can preempt kernel lwps with
.Dv RESCHED_KPREEMPT .
.
.\" ---------
.It Dv __HAVE_PTRACE_MACHDEP
The port has MD
.Xr ptrace 2
requests, defines
.Dv PTRACE_MACHDEP_REQUEST_CASES
macro with
.Ic case
labels for its MD requests.
.
.\" ---------
.It Dv __HAVE_RAS Pq Xr ras 9
The port supports restartable atomic sequences.
.
.\" ---------
.It Dv __HAVE_SIMPLE_MUTEXES Pq Xr mutex 9
The port provides a CAS function that is either MP-safe, or does not
need to be MP safe.
Adaptive mutexes on these architectures do not require an additional
interlock.
.
.\" ---------
.It Dv __HAVE_SPIN_MUTEX_STUBS Pq Xr mutex 9
The port provides fast path enter and exit stubs for spin mutexes.
