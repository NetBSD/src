.Sh DESCRIPTION
Autoconfiguration is the process of matching hardware devices with an
appropriate device driver.  In its most basic form, autoconfiguration
consists of the recursive process of finding and attaching all devices
on a bus, including other busses.
.Pp
The autoconfiguration framework supports
.Em direct configuration
where the bus driver can determine the devices present.  The
autoconfiguration framework also supports
.Em indirect configuration
where the drivers must probe the bus looking the presence of a device.
Direct configuration is preferred since it can find hardware
regardless of the presence of proper drivers.
.Pp
The autoconfiguration process occurs at system bootstrap and is driven
by a table generated from a
.Do
device definition
.Dc
file by
.Xr config 8 .
For a description of the
.Xr config 8
.Do
machine description
.Dc
language, see
.Xr config 9 .
.Pp
Each device must have a name consisting of an alphanumeric string that
ends with a unit number.  The unit number identifies an instance of
the driver.  Device data structures are allocated dynamically during
autoconfiguration, giving a unique address for each instance.
.Sh FUNCTIONS
.Bl -tag -width compact

.It Fn config_search "func" "parent" "aux"
Performs indirect configuration of physical devices.
.Fn config_search
iterates over all potential children, calling the given
function
.Fa func
for each one.  If
.Fa func
is NULL,
.Fn config_search
applies each child's match function instead.  The argument
.Fa parent
is the pointer to the parent's device structure.  The given
.Fa aux
argument describes the device that has been found and is simply passed
on through
.Fa func
to the child.
.Fn config_search
returns a pointer to the best-matched child or NULL otherwise.
.Pp
The role of
.Fa func
is to call
the match function for each device and call
.Fa config_attach
for any positive matches.  If
.Fa func
is NULL, then the parent should record the return value from
.Fn config_search
and call
.Fn config_attach
itself.
.Pp
Note that this function is designed so that it can be used to apply an
arbitrary function to all potential children.  In this case callers
may choose to ignore the return value.
.It Fn config_found_sm "parent" "aux" "print" "submatch"
Performs direct configuration on a physical device.
.Fn config_found_sm
is called by the parent and in turn calls the
.Fa submatch
function to call the match function as
determined by the configuration table.  If
.Fa submatch
is NULL, the driver match functions are called directly.  The argument
.Fa parent
is the pointer to the parent's device structure.  The given
.Fa aux
argument describes the device that has been found.  The
.Em softc
structure for the matched device will be allocated, and the
appropriate driver attach function will be called.  If the device is
matched, the system prints the name of the child and parent devices,
and then calls the
.Fa print
function to produce addition information if desired.  If no driver
takes a match, the same
.Fa print
function is called to complain.  The print function is called with the
.Fa aux
argument and, if the matches failed, the full name (including unit
number) of the parent device, otherwise NULL.  The
.Fa print
function must return an integer value.
.Pp
Two special strings,
.Do
 not configured
.Dc
and
.Do
 unsupported
.Dc
will be appended automatically to non-driver reports if the return
value is UNCONF or UNSUPP respectively; otherwise the function shouuld
return the value QUIET.  
.Pp
.Fn config_found_sm
returns 1 if the device get attached, 0 otherwise.  Most callers can
ignore this value, since the system will already have printed a
diagnostic.
.It Fn config_found "parent" "aux" "print"
This function is equivalent to calling
.Fn config_found_sm "parent" "aux" "print" "submatch"
and is provided for compatibility with older drivers.
.It Fn config_attach "parent" "cf" "aux" "print"
Attach a found device.  Allocates the memory for the
.Em softc
structure and calls the drivers attach function according to the
configuration table.
.It Fn config_detach "dev" "flags"
Called by the parent to detach the child device.  The second argument
.Em flags
contains detachment flags.  Valid values are DETACH_FORCE (force
detachment (eg. because of hardware removal) and DETACH_QUIET (do not
print a notice).
.Fn config_detach
returns zero if successful and an error code otherwise.
.It Fn config_activate "dev"
Called by the parent to activate the child device
.Fa dev .
.It Fn config_deactivate "dev"
Called by the parent to deactivate the child device
.Fa dev .
.It Fn config_defer "dev" "func"
Called by the child to defer the remainder of its configuration until
all its parent's devices have been attached.  At this point, the
function
.Fa func
is called with the argument
.Fa dev .
.It Fn config_interrupts "struct device *dev" "void (*func)(struct device *)"
Called by the child to defer the remainder of its configuration until
interrupts are enabled.  At this point, the function
.Fa func
is called with the argument
.Fa dev .
.It Fn config_pending_incr
Increment the
.Va config_pending
semaphore.  It is used to account for deferred configurations before
mounting the root filesystem.
.It Fn config_pending_decr
Decrement the
.Va config_pending
semaphore.  It is used to account for deferred configurations before
mounting the root filesystem.
