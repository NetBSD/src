.Dt CHOOSEPROC 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm chooseproc
.Nd select next process from system run queue
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include \*[Lt]sys/proc.h\*[Gt]
.Ft struct proc *
.Fn chooseproc "void"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn chooseproc
function is invoked by the scheduler to select the highest priority
process from the system run queue.  If a process is not available on
the system run queue,
.Fn chooseproc
shall go into an ``idle'' loop by invoking
.Xr cpu_idle 9 .
The variable
.Va curproc
is set to
.Dv NULL
while
.Fn chooseproc
is idle so that CPU time is not allocated to the outgoing process.
.Pp
The
.Fn chooseproc
function must be called with the scheduler lock held
.Pq see Xr SCHED_LOCK 9
and at the
.Xr splsched 9
interrupt protection level.
