.Sh NAME
.Nm setrunqueue ,
.Nm remrunqueue
.Nd manipulate system run queue
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include \*[Lt]sys/proc.h\*[Gt]
.Ft void
.Fn setrunqueue "struct proc *p"
.Ft void
.Fn remrunqueue "struct proc *p"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm setrunqueue
and
.Nm remrunqueue
functions manipulate the system queue of runnable processes. The
system scheduler uses this queue to find the highest-priority process
when a process switch occurs. These functions are machine-dependent in
order to permit efficient implementation of priority-based process
selection.
.Pp
The
.Nm setrunqueue
function places the given process on the system run queue. It is an
error to call
.Nm setrunqueue
with a process that is not runnable or that is already on the system
run queue or sleep queue.
.Pp
The
.Nm remrunqueue
function removes the given process from the system run queue. It is an
error to call
.Nm remrunqueue
with a process that is not on the system run queue.
.Pp
These functions must be called with the scheduler lock held and at the
.Nm splsched
interrupt protection level.  The macros
.Dv SCHED_LOCK(s) ,
.Dv SCHED_UNLOCK(s) ,
and
.Dv SCHED_ASSERT_LOCKED() ,
are provided for this locking interface.
