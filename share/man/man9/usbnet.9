.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
framework provides methods usable for USB Ethernet drivers.
The framework has support for these features:
.Bl -bullet -offset 8n
.It
Partial autoconf handling
.It
USB endpoint pipe handling
.It
Rx and Tx chain handling
.It
Generic handlers or support for several struct ifnet callbacks
.It
Network stack locking protocol
.It
Interrupt handling
.El
.Pp
.Nm
provides many or all of the traditional
.Dq softc
members inside
.Va struct usbnet ,
which can be used directly as the device softc structure if
no additional storage is required.
A structure exists for receive and transmit chain management,
.Va struct usbnet_chain ,
that tracks the metadata for each transfer descriptor available,
minimum of one each for Rx and Tx slot, and will be passed
to the Rx and Tx callbacks.
.Pp
There is a
.Va struct usbnet_ops
structure that provides a number of optional and required callbacks
that will be described below.
.Pp
For autoconfiguration the device attach routine is expected to
ensure that this device's
.Va struct usbnet
is the first member of the device softc, if it can not be used directly
as the device softc, as well as set up the necessary structure members,
find end-points, find the Ethernet address if relevant, call
.Fn usbnet_attach ,
set up interface, Ethernet, and MII capabilities, and finally call
.Fn usbnet_attach_ifp .
The device detach routine should free any resources allocated
by attach and then call
.Fn usbnet_detach ,
possibly directly using
.Fn usbnet_detach
as most consumers have no additional resources not owned and
released by the
.Nm
framework itself.
The device activate function should be set to
.Fn usbnet_activate .
.Pp
When bringing an interface up from
.Xr if_init 9 ,
which happens under
.Xr IFNET_LOCK 9 ,
.Nm
will:
.Bl -enum
.It
call
.Dq uno_init
to initialize the hardware for sending and receiving packets,
.It
open the USB pipes,
.It
allocate Rx and Tx buffers for transfers,
.It
call
.Dq uno_mcast
to initially program the hardware multicast filter, and finally
.It
start the Rx transfers so packets can be received.
.El
.Pp
See the
.Sx RECEIVE AND SEND
section for details on using the chains.
.Pp
When bringing an interface down from
.Xr if_stop 9 ,
which happens under
.Xr IFNET_LOCK 9 ,
.Nm
will:
.Bl -enum
.It
abort the USB pipes,
.It
call
.Dq uno_stop
to stop the hardware from receiving packets (unless the device is
detaching),
.It
free Rx and Tx buffers for transfers, and
.It
close the USB pipes.
.El
.Pp
For interface ioctl, most of the handling is in the framework.
While the interface is running, the optional
.Dq uno_mcast
callback is invoked after handling the
.Dv SIOCADDMULTI
and
.Dv SIOCDELMULTI
ioctl commands to update the hardware's multicast filter from the
.Xr ethersubr 9
lists.
The optional
.Dq uno_ioctl
callback, which is invoked under
.Xr IFNET_LOCK 9 ,
can be used to program special settings like offload handling.
.Pp
If ioctl handling requires capturing device-specific ioctls then the
.Dq uno_override_ioctl
callback may be used instead to replace the framework's
ioctl handler completely (i.e., the replacement should call any generic
ioctl handlers such as
.Fn ether_ioctl
as required.)
For sending packets, the
.Dq uno_tx_prepare
callback must be used to convert
an mbuf into a chain buffer ready for transmission.
.Pp
For devices requiring MII handling there are callbacks for reading and
writing registers, and for status change events.
Access to all the MII functions is serialized by
.Nm .
.Pp
As receive must handle the case of multiple packets in one buffer,
the support is split between the driver and the framework.
A
.Dq uno_rx_loop
callback must be provided that loops over the incoming
packet data found in a chain, performs necessary checking and passes
the network frame up the stack via either
.Fn usbnet_enqueue
or
.Fn usbnet_input .
Typically Ethernet devices prefer
.Fn usbnet_enqueue .
.Pp
General accessor functions for
.Fa struct usbnet :
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fn usbnet_set_link un link
Set the link status for this
.Fa un
to
.Fa link .
.It Fn usbnet_ifp un

.It Fn usbnet_rndsrc un
Returns pointer to this
.Fa un Ns 's
.Va krndsource_t .
.It Fn usbnet_softc un
Returns pointer to this
.Fa un Ns 's
device softc.
.It Fn usbnet_havelink un
Returns true if link is active.
.It Fn usbnet_isdying un
Returns true if device is dying (has been pulled or deactivated,
pending detach).
This should be used only to abort timeout loops early.
.El
.Pp

.Fa struct usbnet :
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fn usbnet_enqueue un buf buflen csum_flags csum_data mbuf_flags
Enqueue buffer
.Fa buf
for length
.Fa buflen
with higher layers, using the provided
.Fa csum_flags ,
and

which are written directly to the mbuf packet header, and
.Fa mbuf_flags ,
which is or-ed into the mbuf flags for the created mbuf.
.It Fn usbnet_input un buf buflen
Enqueue buffer
.Fa buf
for length
.Fa buflen
with higher layers.
.El
.Pp
Autoconfiguration handling for
.Fa struct usbnet .

.Sx AUTOCONFIGURATION
section for more details about these functions.
.Bl -tag -width 4n

.Pp
If the passed in
.Fa unm
is

then an MII interface will be created using the values
provided in the
.Fa struct usbnet_mii
structure, which has these members passed to
.Fn mii_attach :

.It un_mii_flags
Flags.
.It un_mii_capmask
Capability mask.
.It un_mii_phyloc
PHY location.
.It un_mii_offset

.El
.Pp
A default
.Fa unm
can be set using the
.Fn USBNET_MII_DECL_DEFAULT

.El
.Pp
The device detach and activate callbacks can typically be set to
.Fn usbnet_detach
and
.Fn usbnet_activate
unless device-specific handling is required, in which case, they
can be called before or after such handling.
.Pp
The capabilities described in both
.Va struct ifp
and
.Va struct ethercom
must be set before calling
.Fn usbnet_attach_ifp .
.Sh RECEIVE AND SEND
Receive and send routines are structured around a the
.Va usbnet_cdata
and
.Va usbnet_chain
structures, the
.Dv un_ed ,
.Dv un_rx_xfer_flags ,
and
.Dv un_tx_xfer_flags
members, and the
.Fn uno_stop ,
.Fn uno_init ,
.Fn uno_tx_prepare ,
and
.Fn uno_rx_loop
callbacks of
.Va usbnet_ops .
.Pp
Typically, the device attach routine will fill in members of the
.Va usbnet
structure, as listed in
.Sx AUTOCONFIGURATION .
The
.Dv un_ed
array should have the
.Dv USBNET_ENDPT_RX
and
.Dv USBNET_ENDPT_TX
array entries filled in, and optionally the
.Dv USBNET_ENDPT_INTR
entry filled in if applicable.
.Pp
The optional
.Fn uno_stop
callback performs device-specific operations to shutdown the
transmit or receive handling.
.Pp
The
.Fn uno_init
callback both performs device-specific enablement and then calls
.Fn usbnet_rx_tx_init ,
which sets up the receive, transmit, and, optionally, the interrupt
pipes, as well as starting the receive pipes.
All USB transfer setup is handled internally to the framework, and
the driver callbacks merely copy data in or out of a chain entry using
what is typically a device-specific method.
.Pp
The
.Fn uno_rx_loop
callback, called sequentially, converts the provided
.Va usbnet_chain
data and length into a series (one or more) of packets that are
enqueued with the higher layers using either
.Fn usbnet_enqueue
(for most devices) or
.Fn usbnet_input
for devices that use
.Fn if_input
.
(This currently relies upon the
.Va struct ifnet
having the
.Dq _if_input
member set as well, which is true for current consumers.)
.Pp
The
.Fn uno_tx_prepare
callback must convert the provided
.Va struct mbuf
into the provided
.Va struct usbnet_chain
performing any device-specific padding, checksum, header or other.
Note that this callback must check that it is not attempting to copy
more than the chain buffer size, as set in the
.Va usbnet
.Dq un_tx_bufsz
member.
This callback is only called once per packet, sequentially.
.Pp
The
.Fa struct usbnet_chain
structure which contains a
.Dq unc_buf
member which has the chain buffer allocated where data should be
copied to or from for receive or transmit operations.
It also contains pointers back to the owning
.Fa struct usbnet ,
and the
.Va struct usbd_xfer
associated with this transfer.
.Sh MII
For devices that have MII support these callbacks in
.Fa struct usbnet_ops
must be provided:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It uno_read_reg
Read an MII register for a particular PHY.
Returns standard
.Xr errno 2 .
Must initialize the result even on failure.
.It uno_write_reg
Write an MII register for a particular PHY.
Returns standard
.Xr errno 2 .
.It uno_statchg
Handle a status change event for this interface.
.El
.Sh INTERRUPT PIPE
The interrupt specific callback,
.Dq uno_intr ,
is an optional callback that can be called periodically, registered by
.Nm
using the
.Fn usbd_open_pipe_intr
function (instead of the
.Fn usbd_open_pipe
function.)
The
.Nm
framework provides most of the interrupt handling and the callback
simply inspects the returned buffer as necessary.
To enable the this callback point the
.Va struct usbnet
member
.Dq un_intr
to a
.Va struct usbnet_intr
structure with these members set:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It uni_buf
Data buffer for interrupt status relies.
.It uni_bufsz
Size of the above buffer.
.It uni_interval
Interval in millieconds.
.El
.Pp
These values will be passed to
.Fn usbd_open_pipe_intr .
.Sh CONVERTING OLD-STYLE DRIVERS
The porting of an older driver to the
.Nm
framework is largely an effort in deleting code.
The process involves making these changes:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Headers
Many headers are included in
.Pa usbnet.h
and can be removed from the driver, as well as headers no longer used,
such as
.Pa callout.h
and
.Pa rndsource.h ,
etc.
.It Device softc
The majority of the driver's existing
.Dq softc
structure can likely be replaced with usage of
.Va struct usbnet
and its related functionality.
This includes at least the device_t pointer, Ethernet address, the
ethercom and mii_data structures, end point descriptors, usbd device,
interface, and task and callout structures (both these probably go
away entirely) and all the associated watchdog handling,
timevals, list size, buffer size and xfer flags for
both Rx, and Tx, and interrupt notices, interface flags, device link,
PHY number, chain data, locks including Rx, Tx, and MII.
There is a driver-only
.Dq un_flags
in the
.Va usbnet
structure available for drivers to use.
.Pp
Many drivers can use the
.Va usbnet
structure as the device private storage passed to
.Dv CFATTACH_DECL_NEW .
Many internal functions to the driver may look better if switched to
operate on the device's
.Va usbnet
as, for example, the
.Va usbd_device
value is now available (and must be set by the driver) in the
.Va usbnet ,
which may be needed for any call to
.Fn usbd_do_request .
The standard endpoint values must be stored in the
.Nm
.Dq un_ed[]
array.
.Pp
As
.Nm
manages xfer chains all code related to the opening, closing, aborting
and transferring of data on pipes is performed by the framework based
upon the buffer size and more provided in
.Va subnet ,
so all code related to them should be deleted.
.It Interface setup
The vast majority of interface specific code should be deleted.
For device-specific interface values, the
.Va ifnet
flags and exflags can be set, as well as the
.Va ethercom
.Dq ec_capabilities
member, before calling
.Fn usbnet_attach_ifp .
All calls to
.Fn ifmedia_init ,
.Fn mii_attach ,
.Fn ifmedia_add ,
.Fn ifmedia_set ,
.Fn if_attach ,
.Fn ether_ifattach ,
.Fn rnd_attach_source ,
and
.Fn usbd_add_drv_event
should be eliminated.
The device
.Dq ioctl
routine can use the default handling with a callback for additional
device specific programming (multicast filters, etc.), which can be
empty, or, the override ioctl can be used for heavier requirements.
The device
.Dq stop
routine is replaced with a simple call that turns off the
device-specific transmitter and receiver if necessary, as the
framework handles pipes and transfers and buffers.
.It MII handling
For devices with MII support the three normal callbacks
.Pq read, write, and status change
must be converted to
.Va usbnet .
Local
.Dq link
variables need to be replaced with accesses to
.Fn usbnet_set_link
and
.Fn usbnet_havelink .
Other ifmedia callbacks that were passed to
.Fn ifmedia_init
should be deleted and any work moved into
.Dq uno_statchg .
.It Receive and Transmit
The
.Nm
framework handles the majority of handling of both network directions.
The interface init routine should keep all of the device specific setup
but replace all pipe management with a call to
.Fn usbnet_init_rx_tx .
The typical receive handling will normally be replaced with a receive
loop functions that can accept one or more packets,
.Dq uno_rx_loop ,
which can use either
.Fn usbnet_enqueue
or
.Fn usbnet_input
to pass the packets up to higher layers.
The typical interface
.Dq if_start
function and any additional functions used will normal be replaced
with a relatively simple
.Dq uno_tx_prepare
function that simply converts an
.Va mbuf
into a
.Va usbnet_chain
useful for this device that will be passed onto
.Fn usbd_transfer .
The framework's handling of the Tx interrupt is all internal.
.It Interrupt pipe handling
For devices requiring special handling of the interrupt pipe (i.e.,
they use the
.Fn usbd_open_pipe_intr
method), most of the interrupt handler should be deleted, leaving
only code that inspects the result of the interrupt transfer.
.It Common errors
It's common to forget to set link active on devices with MII.
Be sure to call
.Fn usbent_set_link
during any status change event.
.Pp
Many locking issues are hidden without
.Dv LOCKDEBUG ,
including hard-hangs.
It's highly recommended to develop with
.Dv LOCKDEBUG .
.Pp
The
.Va usbnet
.Dq un_ed
array is unsigned and should use
.Dq 0
as the no-endpoint value.
