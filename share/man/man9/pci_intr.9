.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
functions exist to allow device drivers machine-independent access to
PCI bus interrupts.  The functions described in this page are
typically declared in a port's
.Pa Aq machine/pci_machdep.h
header file; however, drivers should generally include
.Pa Aq dev/pci/pcivar.h
to get other PCI-specific declarations as well.
.Pp
Each driver has an
.Fn attach
function which has a bus-specific
.Ft attach_args
structure.
Each driver for a PCI device is passed a pointer to an object of type
.Ft struct pci_attach_args
which contains, among other things, information about the location
of the device in the PCI bus topology sufficient to allow interrupts
from the device to be handled.
.Pp
If a driver wishes to establish an interrupt handler for the device,
it should pass the
.Ft struct pci_attach_args *
to the
.Fn pci_intr_map
function, which returns zero on success, and nonzero on failure.  The function
sets the
.Ft "pci_intr_handle_t"
pointed at by its second argument to a machine-dependent value which
identifies a particular interrupt source.
.Pp
If the driver wishes to refer to the interrupt source in an attach or
error message, it should use the value returned by
.Fn pci_intr_string .
.Pp
Subsequently, when the driver is prepared to receive interrupts, it
should call
.Fn pci_intr_establish
to actually establish the handler; when the device interrupts,
.Fa intrhand
will be called with a single argument
.Fa intrarg ,
and will run at the interrupt priority level
.Fa ipl .
.Pp
The return value of
.Fn pci_intr_establish
may be saved and passed to
.Fn pci_intr_disestablish
to disable the interrupt handler
when the driver is no longer interested in interrupts from the device.
