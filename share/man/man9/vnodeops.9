Not all header files are required for each function.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The vnode operations vector describes what operations can be done to
the file associated with the vnode.
The system maintains one vnode operations vector for each file system
type configured into the kernel.
The vnode operations vector contains a pointer to a function for each
operation supported by the file system.
Many of the functions described in the vnode operations vector are
closely related to their corresponding system calls.
In most cases, they are called as a result of the system call
associated with the operation being invoked.
.Pp
Functions in the vnode operations vector are invoked using specialized
macros.
The following table gives a summary of the operations.

.Pp
The implementation details of the vnode operations vector are not
quite what is described here.
.Pp
If the file system type does not support a specific operation, it must
nevertheless assign an appropriate stub in the vnode operations
vector to do the minimum required of it.
In most cases, such functions either do nothing or return an error
value to the effect that it is not supported.
.Pp
Many of the functions in the vnode operations vector take a
componentname structure.
It is used to encapsulate many parameters into a single function
argument.
It has the following structure:
.Bd -literal
struct componentname {
        /*
         * Arguments to lookup.
         */
        uint32_t cn_nameiop;    /* namei operation */
        uint32_t cn_flags;      /* flags to namei */
        kauth_cred_t cn_cred;   /* credentials */
        /*
         * Shared between lookup and commit routines.
         */
        const char *cn_nameptr; /* pointer to looked up name */
        size_t  cn_namelen;     /* length of looked up component */
        size_t  cn_consume;     /* chars to consume in lookup() */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The top half of the structure is used exclusively for the pathname
lookups using
.Fn VOP_LOOKUP
and is initialized by the caller.
The semantics of the lookup are affected by the lookup operation
specified in
.Em cn_nameiop
and the flags specified in
.Em cn_flags .
Valid operations are:
.Pp
.Bl  -tag -offset indent -width LOOKUP -compact
.It LOOKUP
perform name lookup only
.It CREATE
set up for file creation
.It DELETE
set up for file deletion
.It RENAME
set up for file renaming
.It OPMASK
mask for operation
.El
.Pp
Valid values for
.Em cn-\*[Gt]cn_flags
are:
.Pp
.Bl  -tag -offset indent -width LOCKPARENT -compact
.It LOCKLEAF
lock inode on return
.It LOCKPARENT
want parent vnode returned locked
.It NOCACHE
name must not be left in name cache (see
.Xr namecache 9 )
.It FOLLOW
follow symbolic links
.It NOFOLLOW
do not follow symbolic links (pseudo)
.It MODMASK
mask of operational modifiers
.El
.Pp
No vnode operations may be called from interrupt context.
Most operations also require the vnode to be locked on entry.
To prevent deadlocks, when acquiring locks on multiple vnodes, the
lock of parent directory must be acquired before the lock on the child
directory.
.Pp
Vnode operations for a file system type generally should not be
called directly from the kernel, but accessed indirectly through the
high-level convenience functions discussed in
.Xr vnsubr 9 .
.Sh FUNCTIONS
.Bl -tag -width compact
.It Fn VOP_LOOKUP "dvp" "vpp" "cnp"
Lookup a single pathname component in a given directory.
The argument
.Fa dvp
is the locked vnode of the directory to search and
.Fa cnp
is the pathname component to be searched for.
If the pathname component is found, the address of the resulting
unlocked vnode is returned in
.Fa vpp .
The operation specified in
.Em cnp-\*[Gt]cn_nameiop
indicates
.Fn VOP_LOOKUP
the reason for requesting the lookup and uses it to cache
file system type specific information in the vnode for subsequent
operations.
.Pp
There are three types of lookups: ".", ".." (ISDOTDOT), and regular.
If the pathname component being searched for is ".", then
.Fa dvp
has an extra reference added to it and it is returned in
.Fa *vpp .
For other pathname components,
.Fn VOP_LOOKUP
checks the accessibility of the directory and searches the name cache
for the pathname component.
See
.Xr namecache 9 .
If the pathname is not found in the name cache, the directory is
searched for the pathname.
The resulting unlocked vnode is returned in
.Fa vpp .
.Fa dvp
is always returned locked.
.Pp
On failure
.Fa *vpp
is
.Dv NULL ,
and
.Fa *dvp
is left locked.
If the operation is successful
.Fa *vpp
is unlocked and zero is returned.
Typically, if
.Fa *vpp
and
.Fa dvp
are the same vnode the caller will need to release twice (decrement
the reference count) and unlock once.
.It Fn VOP_CREATE "dvp" "vpp" "cnp" "vap"
Create a new file in a given directory.
The argument
.Fa dvp
is the locked vnode of the directory to create the new file in and
.Fa cnp
is the pathname component of the new file.
The argument
.Fa vap
specifies the attributes that the new file should be created with.
If the file is successfully created, the address of the resulting
unlocked vnode is returned in
.Fa vpp
and zero is returned.
.Pp
This function is called after
.Fn VOP_LOOKUP
when a file is being created.
Normally,
.Fn VOP_LOOKUP
will have set the SAVENAME flag in
.Em cnp-\*[Gt]cn_flags
to keep the memory pointed to by
.Em cnp-\*[Gt]cn_pnbuf
valid.
If an error is detected when creating the file, this memory is
released.
If the file is created successfully it will be released unless the
SAVESTART flags in specified in
.Em cnp-\*[Gt]cn_flags .
.It Fn VOP_MKNOD "dvp" "vpp" "cnp" "vap"
Make a new device-special file in a given directory.
The argument
.Fa dvp
is the locked vnode of the directory to create the new device-special
file in and
.Fa cnp
is the pathname component of the new device-special file.
The argument
.Fa vap
specifies the attributes that the new device-special file should be
created with.
If the file is successfully created, the address of the resulting
unlocked vnode is returned in
.Fa vpp
and zero is returned.
.Pp
This function is called after
.Fn VOP_LOOKUP
when a device-special file is being created.
Normally,
.Fn VOP_LOOKUP
will have set the SAVENAME flag in
.Em cnp-\*[Gt]cn_flags
to keep the memory pointed to by
.Em cnp-\*[Gt]cn_pnbuf
valid.
If an error is detected when creating the device-special file,
this memory is released.
If the device-special file is created successfully it will be released
unless the SAVESTART flags in specified in
.Em cnp-\*[Gt]cn_flags .
.It Fn VOP_OPEN "vp" "mode" "cred"
Open a file.
The argument
.Fa vp
is the vnode of the file to open and
.Fa mode
specifies the access mode required by the calling process.
The calling credentials are specified by
.Fa cred .
The access mode is a set of flags, including FREAD, FWRITE,
O_NONBLOCK, O_APPEND, etc.
.Fn VOP_OPEN
must be called before a file can be accessed by a thread.
The vnode reference count is incremented.
.Pp
.Fn VOP_OPEN
expects the vnode
.Fa vp
to be locked on entry and will leave it locked on return.
If the operation is successful zero is returned, otherwise an
appropriate error code is returned.
.It Fn VOP_CLOSE "vp" "fflag" "cred"
Close a file.
The argument
.Fa vp
is the vnode of the file to close and
.Fa fflag
specifies the access mode by the calling process.
The possible flags are
.Dv FREAD ,
.Dv FWRITE
and
.Dv FNONBLOCK .
The calling credentials are specified by
.Fa cred .
.Fn VOP_CLOSE
frees resources allocated by
.Fn VOP_OPEN .
.Pp
The vnode
.Fa vp
will be locked on entry and should remain locked on return.
.It Fn VOP_ACCESS "vp" "mode" "cred"
Determine the accessibility (permissions) of the file against the
specified credentials.
The argument
.Fa vp
is the vnode of the file to check,
.Fa mode
is the type of access required and
.Fa cred
contains the user credentials to check.
The argument
.Fa mode
is a mask which can contain VREAD, VWRITE or VEXEC.
If the file is accessible in the specified way, zero is returned,
otherwise an appropriate error code is returned.
.Pp
The vnode
.Fa vp
will be locked on entry and should remain locked on return.
.It Fn VOP_GETATTR "vp" "vap" "cred"
Get specific vnode attributes on a file.
The argument
.Fa vp
is the vnode of the file to get the attributes for.
The argument
.Fa cred
specifies the calling credentials.
.Fn VOP_GETATTR
uses the file system type specific data object
.Em vp-\*[Gt]v_data
to reference the underlying file attributes.
Attributes associated with the file are collected by setting the
required attribute bits in
.Em vap-\*[Gt]va_mask .
The attributes are returned in
.Fa vap .
Attributes which are not available are set to the value VNOVAL.
.Pp
For more information on vnode attributes see
.Xr vattr 9 .
Historically it was considered acceptable to call
.Fn VOP_GETATTR
without first locking the vnode.
This usage is deprecated.
.Pp
The vnode
.Fa vp
will be locked on entry and should remain locked on return.
.It Fn VOP_SETATTR "vp" "vap" "cred"
Set specific vnode attributes on a file.
The argument
.Fa vp
is the locked vnode of the file to set the attributes for.
The argument
.Fa cred
specifies the calling credentials.
.Fn VOP_SETATTR
uses the file system type specific data object
.Em vp-\*[Gt]v_data
to reference the underlying file attributes.
The new attributes are defined in
.Fa vap .
Attributes associated with the file are set by setting the required
attribute bits in
.Em vap-\*[Gt]va_mask .
Attributes which are not being modified by
.Fn VOP_SETATTR
should be set to the value VNOVAL.
If the operation is successful zero is returned, otherwise an
appropriate error is returned.
.Pp
For more information on vnode attributes see
.Xr vattr 9 .
.It Fn VOP_READ "vp" "uio" "ioflag" "cred"
Read the contents of a file.
The argument
.Fa vp
is the vnode of the file to read from,
.Fa uio
is the location to read the data into,
.Fa ioflag
is a set of flags and
.Fa cred
are the credentials of the calling process.
.Pp
The
.Fa ioflag
argument is used to give directives and hints to the file system.
When attempting a read, the high 16 bits are used to provide a
read-ahead hint (in unit of file system blocks) that the file system
should attempt.
The low 16 bits are a bit mask which can contain the following flags:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width IO_ALTSEMANTICS -compact
.It IO_UNIT
do I/O as atomic unit
.It IO_APPEND
append write to end
.It IO_SYNC
sync I/O file integrity completion
.It IO_NODELOCKED
underlying node already locked
.It IO_NDELAY
FNDELAY flag set in file table
.It IO_DSYNC
sync I/O data integrity completion
.It IO_ALTSEMANTICS
use alternate I/O semantics
.It IO_NORMAL
operate on regular data
.It IO_EXT
operate on extended attributes
.It IO_DIRECT
do not buffer data in the kernel
.El
.Pp
Zero is returned on success, otherwise an error is returned.
The vnode should be locked on entry and remains locked on exit.
.It Fn VOP_WRITE "vp" "uio" "ioflag" "cred"
Write to a file.
The argument
.Fa vp
is the vnode of the file to write to,
.Fa uio
is the location of the data to write,
.Fa ioflag
is a set of flags and
.Fa cred
are the credentials of the calling process.
.Pp
The
.Fa ioflag
argument is used to give directives and hints to the file system.
The low 16 bits are a bit mask which can contain the same flags as
.Fn VOP_READ .
.Pp
Zero is returned on success, otherwise an error is returned.
The vnode should be locked on entry and remains locked on exit.
.It Fn VOP_FALLOCATE "vp" "pos" "len"
Allocate backing store.
The argument
.Fa vp
is the vnode for the file.
The
.Fa pos
and
.Fa len
arguments (specified in bytes) name an extent within the file.
The blocks underlying this range, rounding up at the top and down at
the bottom if needed, are checked; if no physical storage is
allocated, a physical block is allocated and zeroed.
This operation removes
.Dq holes
from files.
.It Fn VOP_FDISCARD "vp" "pos" "len"
Discard backing store.
The argument
.Fa vp
is the vnode for the file.
The
.Fa pos
and
.Fa len
arguments (specified in bytes) name an extent within the file.
The blocks underlying this range, rounding down at the top and up at
the bottom if needed, are checked.
If any physical storage is used, it is deallocated.
This operation creates
.Dq holes
in files.
Discarded blocks of regular files read back afterwards as zeroes.
On devices, the underlying discard-block operation if any (e.g. ATA
TRIM) is issued.
The device handles this as it sees fit.
In particular it is
.Em not
guaranteed that discarded blocks on devices will be zeroed; reading a
discarded block might produce zeros, or ones, or the previously
existing data, or some other data, or trash.
.\" XXX: if you discard part of a block in a regular file, should that
.\" part be explicitly zeroed? Also, how do you find the underlying
.\" block size?
.It Fn VOP_IOCTL "vp" "command" "data" "fflag" "cred"
Perform device-specific I/O.
The argument
.Fa vp
is the locked vnode of the file, normally representing a device.
The argument
.Fa command
specifies the device-specific operation to perform and
.Fa cnp
provides extra data for the specified operation.
The argument
.Fa fflags
is a set of flags.
The argument
.Fa cred
is the caller's credentials.
If the operation is successful, zero is
returned, otherwise an appropriate error code is returned.
.Pp
Most file systems do not supply a function for
.Fn VOP_IOCTL .
This function implements the
.Xr ioctl 2
system call.
.It Fn VOP_FCNTL "vp" "command" "data" "fflag" "cred"
Perform file control.
The argument
.Fa vp
is the locked vnode of the file.
The argument
.Fa command
specifies the operation to perform and
.Fa cnp
provides extra data for the specified operation.
The argument
.Fa fflags
is a set of flags.
The argument
.Fa cred
is the caller's credentials.
If the operation is successful, zero is returned, otherwise an
appropriate error code is returned.
.It Fn VOP_POLL "vp" "events"
Test if a poll event has occurred.
The argument
.Fa vp
is the vnode of the file to poll.
It returns any events of interest as specified by
.Fa events
that may have occurred for the file.
The argument
.Fa events
is a set of flags as specified by
.Xr poll 2 .
.Pp
The vnode
.Fa vp
remains unlocked throughout the whole operation.
.It Fn VOP_KQFILTER "vp" "kn"
Register a knote
.Fa kn
with the vnode
.Fa vn .
If the operation is successful zero is returned, otherwise an
appropriate error code is returned.
.Pp
The vnode
.Fa vp
remains unlocked throughout the whole operation.
.It Fn VOP_REVOKE "vp" "flags"
Eliminate all activity associated with the vnode

.Fa vp
is in the process of being memory mapped.
The argument
.Fa prot
specifies the vm access protection the vnode is going to be mapped with.
The argument
.Fa cred
is the caller's credentials.
If the file system allows the memory mapping, zero is returned, otherwise
an appropriate error code is returned.
.Pp
Most file systems do not supply a function for
.Fn VOP_MMAP
and use
.Fn genfs_mmap
to default for success.
Only file systems which do not integrate with the page cache at all
typically want to disallow memory mapping.
.It Fn VOP_FSYNC "vp" "cred" "flags" "offlo" "offhi"

Test if the file is seekable for the specified offset
.Fa newoff .
The argument
.Fa vp
is the locked vnode of the file to test.
For most file systems this function simply tests if

code is returned.
.Pp
The caller must hold the target file system's rename lock.
The source directory and file vnodes should be unlocked and their
reference counts should be incremented before entry.
The target directory and file vnodes should both be locked on entry.
.Fn VOP_RENAME
updates the reference counts prior to returning.
.Pp
Because of the complexity and nastiness of the interface, please do
not write new code that calls
.Fn VOP_RENAME
directly until such time as ongoing cleanup work reaches a point where
the interface has been rendered halfway sane.

The arguments
.Fa cookies
and
.Fa ncookies
specify the addresses for the list and number of directory seek
cookies generated for NFS.
Both

should be
.Dv NULL
if they aren't required to be returned by
.Fn VOP_READDIR .
The directory contents are read into struct dirent structures and
.Fa uio-\*[Gt]uio_offset
is set to the offset of the next unread directory entry.
This offset may be used in a following invocation to continue a
sequential read of the directory contents.
If the operation is successful zero is returned, otherwise an
appropriate error code is returned.
.Pp
The directory should be locked on entry and will remain locked on
return.
.Pp
In case
