.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn todr_*
functions provide an interface to read, set and control
.Ql time-of-day
devices.
A driver for a
.Ql time-of-day
device registers its
.Fa todr_chip_handle_t
with machine-dependent code using the
.Fn todr_attach
function.
Alternatively, a machine-dependent front-end to a
.Ql time-of-day
device driver may obtain the
.Fa todr_chip_handle_t
directly.
.Pp
The
.Fn todr_gettime
retrieves the current data and time from the TODR device and returns it
in the
.Fa struct timeval
storage provided by the caller.
.Fn todr_settime
sets the date and time in the TODR device represented by
.Fa todr_chip_handle_t
according to the
.Fa struct timeval
argument.
.Pp
The utilities
.Fn clock_secs_to_ymdhms
and
.Fn clock_ymdhms_to_secs
are provided to convert a time value in seconds to and from a structure
representing the date and time as a
.Aq year,month,day,weekday,hour,minute,seconds
tuple.
This structure is defined as follows:
.Bd -literal
struct clock_ymdhms {
	uint64_t dt_year;	/* Year */
	u_char dt_mon;		/* Month (1-12) */
	u_char dt_day;		/* Day (1-31) */
	u_char dt_wday;		/* Day of week (0-6) */
	u_char dt_hour;		/* Hour (0-23) */
	u_char dt_min;		/* Minute (0-59) */
	u_char dt_sec;		/* Second (0-59) */
};
.Ed
.Pp
Note: leap years are recognised by these conversion routines.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn todr_*
functions return 0 if the requested operation was successful;
otherwise an error code from
.In sys/errno.h
shall be returned.
However, behaviour is undefined if an invalid
.Fa todr_chip_handle_t
is passed to any of these functions.
.Pp
The
.Fn clock_ymdhms_to_secs
function returns \-1 if the time in seconds would be less that zero or too
large to fit in a
.Fa time_t .
The
.Fn clock_secs_to_ymdhms
function returns 0 on success or
.Er EINVAL
if the time passed is negative.
