.Sh NAME
.Nm wdc
.Nd machine-independent IDE/ATAPI driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <dev/ata/atavar.h>
.Fd #include <sys/dev/ic/wdcvar.h>
.Ft int
.Fn wdcprobe "struct channel_softc * chp"
.Ft void
.Fn wdcattach "struct channel_softc * chp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides the machine independent core functions for driving IDE
devices.
IDE devices-specific drivers (
.Nm wd
or
.Nm atapibus )
will use services provided by
.Nm wdc .
.Pp
The machine-dependent bus front-end provides informations to
.Nm
with the
.Va wdc_softc
and
.Va channel_softc
structures.
The first one defines global controller properties, and the second contains
per-channel informations.
.Nm
returns informations about the attached devices in the
.Va ata_drive_datas
structure.

.Pp
The bus front-end needs to fill in the following elements of
.Va wdc_softc :
.Bl -tag -compact -width "dma_finish" -offset "xxxx"
.It cap
supports one or more of the WDC_CAPABILITY flags
.It nchannels
number of channels supported by this controller
.It channels
array of
.Va struct channel_softc
of size
.Va nchannels
properly initialised
.El
The following elements are optional:
.Bl -tag -compact -width "dma_finish" -offset "xxxx"
.It pio_mode
.It dma_mode
.It dma_arg
.It dma_init
.It dma_start
.It dma_finish
.It claim_hw
.It free_hw
.El
.Pp
The
.Va WDC_CAPABILITY_DATA16
and
.Va WDC_CAPABILITY_DATA32
flags informs
.Nm
whether the controller supports 16- or 32-bit I/O accesses on the data port.
If both are set, a test will be done for each drive using the ATA or
ATAPI IDENTIFY command, to automatically select the working mode.
.Pp
The
.Va WDC_CAPABILITY_DMA
and
.Va WDC_CAPABILITY_UDMA
flags are set for controllers supporting the DMA and Ultra-DMA modes.
The bus front-end needs to provide the
.Fn dma_init ,
.Fn dma_start
and
.Fn dma_finish
functions.
.Fn dma_init
is called just before issuing a DMA command to the IDE device.
The arguments are, respectively:
.Va dma_arg ,
the channel number, the drive number on this channel,
the virtual address of the DMA buffer, the size of the transfer, and the
.Va WDC_DMA
flags.
.Fn dma_start
is called just after issuing a DMA command to the IDE device.
The arguments are, respectively:
.Va dma_arg ,
the channel number, the drive number on this channel, and the
.Va WDC_DMA
flags.
.Fn dma_finish
is called once the transfer is complete.
The arguments are, respectively:
.Va dma_arg ,
the channel number, the drive number on this channel, and the
.Va WDC_DMA
flags.
.Va WDC_DMA_READ
indicates the direction of the data transfer, and
.Va WDC_DMA_POLL
indicates if the transfer will use (or used) interrupts.
.Pp
The
.Va WDC_CAPABILITY_MODE
flag means that the bus front-end can program the PIO and DMA modes, so
.Nm
needs to provide back the supported modes for each drive, and set the drives
modes.
The
.Va pio_mode
and
.Va dma_mode
needs to be set to the highest PIO and DMA mode supported.
If
.Va WDC_CAPABILITY_UDMA
is set, then
.Va dma_mode
must be set to the highest Ultra-DMA mode supported.
If
.Va WDC_CAPABILITY_MODE
is not set,
.Nm
will not attempt to change the current drive's settings, assuming the host's
firmware has done it right.
.Pp
The
.Va WDC_CAPABILITY_HWLOCK
flag is set for controllers needing hardware looking before accessing the
I/O ports.
If this flag is set, the bus front-end needs to provide the
.Fn claim_hw
and
.Fn free_hw
functions.
.Fn claim_hw
will be called when the driver wants to access the controller ports.
The second parameter is set to 1 when it is possible to sleep waiting
for the lock, 0 otherwise.
It should return 1 when access has been granted, 0 otherwise.
When access has not been granted and sleep is not allowed, the bus
front-end shall call
.Fn wdcrestart
with the first argument passed to
.Fn claim_hw
as argument.
This arguments will also be the one passed to
.Fn free_hw .
This function is called once the transfer is complete, so that the lock can
be released.
.Pp
Accesses to the data port are done by using the bus_space stream functions,
unless the
.Va WDC_CAPABILITY_ATA_NOSTREAM
or
.Va WDC_CAPABILITY_ATAPI_NOSTREAM
flags are set.
This should not be used, unless the data bus is not wired properly (which
seems common on big-endian systems), and byte-order needs to be preserved
for compatibility with the host's firmware.
Also note that the IDE bus is a little-endian bus, so the bus_space
functions used for the bus_space tag passed in the
.Va channel_softc
have to do the appropriate byte-swapping for big-endian systems.
.Pp
.Va WDC_CAPABILITY_NO_EXTRA_RESETS
avoid the controller reset at the end of the disks probe.
This reset is needed for some controllers, but causes problems with some
others.
.Pp
The bus front-end needs to fill in the following
elements of
.Va channel_softc :
.Bl -tag -compact -width "dma_finish" -offset "xxxx"
.It channel
The channel number on the controller
.It wdc
A pointer to the controller's wdc_softc
.It cmd_iot, cmd_ioh
Bus-space tag and handle for access to the command block registers (which
includes the 16-bit data port)
.It ctl_iot, ctl_ioh
Bus-space tag and handle for access to the control block registers
.It ch_queue
A pointer to a
.Va struct channel_queue .
This will hold the queues of outstanding commands for this controller.
.El
The following elements are optional:
.Bl -tag -compact -width "dma_finish" -offset "xxxx"
.It data32iot, data32ioh
Bus-space tag and handle for 32-bit data accesses.
Only needed if
.Va WDC_CAPABILITY_DATA32
is set in the controller's
.Va wdc_softc .
.El
.Pp
.Va ch_queue
can point to a common
.Va struct channel_queue
if the controller doesn't support concurrent access to its different channels.
If all channels are independent, it is recommended that each channel has
its own
.Va ch_queue
(for better performance).
.Pp
The bus-specific front-end can use the
.Fn wdcprobe
function, with a properly initialised
.Va struct channel_softc
as argument (
.Va wdc
can be set to NULL.
This allows
.Fn wdcprobe
to be easily used in bus front-end probe functions).
This function will return an integer where bit 0 will be set if the master
device has been found, and 1 if the slave device has been found.
.Pp
The bus-specific attach function has to call
.Fn wdcattach
for each channel, with a pointer to a properly initialised
.Va channel softc
as argument.
This will probe devices attached to the IDE channel and attach them.
Once this function returns, the
.Va ch_drive
array of the
.Va channel_softc
will contain the drive's capabilities.
This can be used to properly initialise the controller's mode, or disable a
channel without drives.
.Pp
The elements of interest in
.Va ata_drive_datas
for a bus front-end are:
.Bl -tag -compact -width "dma_finish" -offset "xxxx"
.It drive
The drive number
.It drive_flags
Flags indicating the drive capabilities.
A null
.Va drive_flags
indicate either that no drive is here, or that no driver was
found for this device.
.It PIO_mode, DMA_mode, UDMA_mode
the highest supported modes for this drive compatible with the controller's
capabilities.
Needs to be reset to the mode to use by the drive, if known.
.It drv_softc
A pointer to the drive's softc.
Can be used to print the drive's name.
.El
.Pp
.Va drive_flags
handles the following flags:
.Bl -tag -compact -width "dma_finish" -offset "xxxx"
.It DRIVE_ATA, DRIVE_ATAPI
Gives the drive type, if any.
The shortcut DRIVE can be used to just test the presence/absence of a drive.
.It DRIVE_CAP32
This drive works with 32-bit data I/O.
.It DRIVE_DMA
This drive supports DMA.
.It DRIVE_UDMA
This drive supports Ultra-DMA.
.It DRIVE_MODE
This drive properly reported its PIO and DMA mode.
.El
.Pp
Once the controller has been initialised, it has to reset the
.Va DRIVE_DMA
and
.Va DRIVE_UDMA ,
as well as the values of
.Va PIO_mode ,
.Va DMA_mode
and
.Va UDMA_mode
if the modes to be used are not highest ones supported by the drive.

.Sh CODE REFERENCES
The wdc core functions are implemented in
.Pa sys/dev/ic/wdc.c .
Low-level ATA and ATAPI support is provided by
.Pa sys/dev/ata_wdc.c
and
.Pa sys/dev/scsipi/atapi_wdc.c
respectively.
.Pp
An example of a simple bus front-end can be found in
.Pa sys/dev/isapnp/wdc_isapnp.c .
A more complex one, with multiple channels and bus-master DMA support is
.Pa sys/dev/pci/pciide.c .
.Pa sys/arch/atari/dev/wdc_mb.c
makes use of hardware locking, and also provides an example of bus-front
end for a big-endian system, which needs byte-swapping bus_space functions.
