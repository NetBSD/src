.Sh NAME
.Nm kauth
.Nd kernel authorization framework
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/kauth.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm ,
or kernel authorization, is the subsystem managing all authorization requests
inside the kernel.
It manages user credentials and rights, and can be used
to implement a system-wide security policy.
It allows external modules to plug-in the authorization process.
.Pp
.Nm
introduces some new concepts, namely
.Dq scopes
and
.Dq listeners ,
which will be detailed together with other useful information for kernel
developers in this document.
.Ss Types
Some
.Nm
types include the following:
.Bl -tag
.It kauth_cred_t
Representing credentials that can be associated with an object.
Includes user- and group-ids (real, effective, and save) as well as group
membership information.
.It kauth_scope_t
Describes a scope.
.It kauth_listener_t
Describes a listener.
.El
.Ss Terminology
.Nm
operates in various
.Dq scopes ,
each scope holding a group of
.Dq listeners .
.Pp
Each listener works as a callback for when an authorization request within the
scope is made.
When such a request is made, all listeners on the scope are passed common
information such as the credentials of the request context, an identifier for
the requested operation, and possibly other information as well.
.Pp
Every listener examines the passed information and returns its decision
regarding the requested operation.
It can either allow, deny, or defer the operation -- in which case, the
decision is left to the other listeners.
.Pp
For an operation to be allowed, all listeners must not return any deny
or defer decisions.
.Pp
Scopes manage listeners that operate in the same aspect of the system.
.Ss Kernel Programming Interface
.Nm
exports a KPI that allows developers both of
.Nx
and third-party products to authorize requests, access and modify credentials,
create and remove scopes and listeners, and perform other miscellaneous operations on
credentials.
.Ss Authorization Requests
.Nm
provides a single authorization request routine, which all authorization
requests go through.
This routine dispatches the request to the listeners of the appropriate scope,
together with four optional user-data variables, and returns the augmented
result.
.Pp
It is declared as
.Pp
.Ft int Fn kauth_authorize_action "kauth_scope_t scope" "kauth_cred_t cred" \
"kauth_action_t op" "void *arg0" "void *arg1" "void *arg2" "void *arg3"
.Pp
An authorization request can return one of two possible values.
Zero indicates success -- the operation is allowed;
.Er EPERM
(see
.Xr errno 2 )
indicates failure -- the operation is denied.
.Pp
Each scope has its own authorization wrapper, to make it easy to call from various
places by eliminating the need to specify the scope and/or cast values.
The authorization wrappers are detailed in each scope's section.
.Ss Generic Scope
The generic scope,
.Dq org.netbsd.kauth.generic ,
manages generic authorization requests in the kernel.
.Pp
The authorization wrapper for this scope is declared as
.Pp
.Ft int Fn kauth_authorize_generic "kauth_cred_t cred" "kauth_action_t op" \
"void *arg0"
.Pp
The following operations are available for this scope:
.Bl -tag
.It Dv KAUTH_GENERIC_ISSUSER
Checks whether the credentials belong to the super-user.
.Pp
Using this request is strongly discouraged and should only be done as a
temporary place-holder, as it is breaking the separation between the
interface for authorization requests from the back-end implementation.
.It Dv KAUTH_GENERIC_CANSEE
Checks whether an object with one set of credentials can access
information about another object, possibly with a different set of
credentials.
.Pp
.Ar arg0
contains the credentials of the object looked at.
.Pp
This request should be issued only in cases where generic credentials
check is required; otherwise it is recommended to use the object-specific
routines.
.El
.Ss System Scope
The system scope,
.Dq org.netbsd.kauth.system ,
manages authorization requests affecting the entire system.
.Pp
The authorization wrapper for this scope is declared as
.Pp
.Ft int Fn kauth_authorize_system "kauth_cred_t cred" \

will be returned.
.El
.Ss Credentials Inheritance and Reference Counting
.Nm
provides a KPI for handling a
.Ft kauth_cred_t
in shared credentials situations and credential inheritance.
.Pp
When a
.Ft kauth_cred_t
is first allocated, its reference count is set to 1.
However, with time, its reference count can grow as more objects (processes,
LWPs, files, etc.) reference it.
One such case is during a
.Xr fork 2
where the child process and its LWPs inherit the credentials of the parent.
.Pp
To prevent freeing a
.Ft kauth_cred_t
while it is still referenced, the following routines are available to maintain
its reference count:
.Bl -tag
.It Ft void Fn kauth_cred_hold "kauth_cred_t cred"
Increases reference count to
.Ar cred
by one.
.It Ft void Fn kauth_cred_free "kauth_cred_t cred"
Decreases the reference count to
.Ar cred
by one.
.Pp
If the reference count dropped to zero, the memory used by
.Ar cred
will be returned back to the memory pool.
.El
.Ss Credentials Memory Management
Data-structures for credentials, listeners, and scopes are allocated from
memory pools managed by the
.Xr pool 9
subsystem.
.Pp
The
.Ft kauth_cred_t
objects have their own memory management routines:
.Bl -tag
.It Ft kauth_cred_t Fn kauth_cred_alloc "void"
Allocates a new
.Ft kauth_cred_t ,
initializes its lock, and sets its reference count to one.
.El
.Ss Conversion Routines
Sometimes it might be necessary to convert a
.Ft kauth_cred_t
to a predecessing type, such as
.Ft struct pcred
or
.Ft struct ucred ,
or convert credentials passed from userland as a
.Ft struct uucred
to a
.Ft kauth_cred_t .
.Pp
The following routines are available for these cases:
.Bl -tag
.It Ft void Fn kauth_cred_topcred "kauth_cred_t cred" "struct pcred *pcred"
Convert a
.Ft kauth_cred_t
to a
.Ft struct pcred .
.Pp
This includes real and saved user- and group-ids and reference count, copied
from
.Ar cred .
The
.Ar pc_ucred
field in the destination is set to
.Dv NULL .
.It Ft void Fn kauth_cred_toucred "kauth_cred_t cred" "struct ucred *ucred"
Convert a
.Ft kauth_cred_t
to a
.Ft struct ucred .
.Pp
This includes effective user- and group-ids, number of groups, and the group
list from
.Ar cred .
.Pp
Note that
.Nm
will try to copy as many groups as
.Ar ucred
can hold.
.It Ft void Fn kauth_cred_uucvt "kauth_cred_t cred" "const struct uucred *uucred"
Convert userland's view of credentials to a
.Ft kauth_cred_t .
.Pp
This includes effective user- and group-ids, a number of groups, and a group
list.
The reference count is set to one.
.Pp
Note that
.Nm
will try to copy as many groups as can be held inside a
.Ft kauth_cred_t .
The addition of groups will also guarantee order and no duplicates.
.It Ft int Fn kauth_cred_uucmp "kauth_cred_t cred" "struct uucred *uucred"
Compares
.Ar cred
with the userland credentials in
.Ar uucred .
.Pp
Common values that will be compared are effective user- and group-ids, and
the group list.
.El
.Ss Miscellaneous Routines
Other routines provided by
.Nm
are:
.Bl -tag
.It Ft void Fn kauth_cred_clone "kauth_cred_t cred1" "kauth_cred_t cred2"
Clone credentials from
.Ar cred1
to
.Ar cred2 ,
except for the lock and reference count.
.Pp
.It Ft kauth_cred_t Fn kauth_cred_dup "kauth_cred_t cred"
Duplicate
.Ar cred .
.Pp
What this routine does is call
.Fn kauth_cred_alloc
followed by a call to
.Fn kauth_cred_clone .
.It Ft kauth_cred_t Fn kauth_cred_copy "kauth_cred_t cred"
Works like
.Fn kauth_cred_dup ,
except for a few differences.
.Pp
If
.Ar cred
already has a reference count of one, it will be returned.
Otherwise, a new
.Ft kauth_cred_t
will be allocated and the credentials from
.Ar cred
will be cloned to it.
Last, a call to
.Fn kauth_cred_free
for
.Ar cred
will be done.
.It Ft kauth_cred_t Fn kauth_cred_get "void"
Return the credentials associated with the current LWP.
.El
.Ss Scope Management
.Nm
provides routines to manage the creation and deletion of scopes on the
system.
.Pp
Note that the built-in scopes, the
.Dq generic
scope and the
.Dq process
scope, can't be deleted.
.Bl -tag
.It Ft kauth_scope_t Fn kauth_register_scope "const char *id" \
"kauth_scope_callback_t cb" "void *cookie"
Register a new scope on the system.
.Ar id
is the name of the scope, usually in reverse DNS-like notation.
For example,
.Dq org.netbsd.kauth.myscope .
.Ar cb
is the default listener, to which authorization requests for this scope
will be dispatched to.
.Ar cookie
is optional user-data that will be passed to all listeners
during authorization on the scope.
.It Ft void Fn kauth_deregister_scope "kauth_scope_t scope"
Deregister
.Ar scope
from the scopes available on the system.
.El
.Ss Listener Management
Listeners in
.Nm
are authorization callbacks that are called during an authorization
request in the scope which they belong to.
.Pp
When an authorization request is made, all listeners associated with
a scope are called to allow, deny, or defer the request.
.Pp
It is enough for one listener to deny the request in order for the
request to be denied; but all listeners are called during an authorization
process none-the-less.
All listeners are required to allow the request for it to be granted,
and in a case where all listeners defer the request -- leaving the decision
for other listeners -- the request is denied.
.Pp
The following KPI is provided for the management of listeners:
.Bl -tag
.It Ft kauth_listener_t Fn kauth_listen_scope "const char *id" \
"kauth_scope_callback_t cb" "void *cookie"
Create a new listener on the scope with the id
.Ar id ,
setting the default listener to
.Ar cb .
.\".Ar cookie
.\"is optional user-data that will be passed to the listener when called
.\"during an authorization request.
.It Ft void Fn kauth_unlisten_scope "kauth_listener_t listener"
Remove
.Ar listener
from the scope which it belongs to.
.Pp
Effectively what this does is is remove the callback from the chain of
functions to be called when an authorization request is made, preventing
from the listener from being entered in the future.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
provides no means for synchronization within listeners.
It is the the programmer's responsibility to make sure data used by the
listener is properly locked during its use, as it can be accessed
simultaneously from the same listener called multiple times.
It is also the programmer's responsibility to do garbage collection after
the listener, possibly freeing any allocated data it used.
.Pp
The common method to do the above is by having a reference count to
each listener.
On entry to the listener, this reference count should be raised, and
on exit -- lowered.
.Pp
During the removal of a listener, first
.Fn kauth_scope_unlisten
should be called to make sure the listener code will not be entered in
the future.
Then, the code should wait (possibly sleeping) until the reference count
drops to zero.
When that happens, it is safe to do the final cleanup.
.Pp
Listeners might sleep, so no locks can be held when calling an authorization
wrapper.

The kernel authorization framework in
.Nx
first appeared in
.Nx 4.0 ,
and is a clean-room implementation based on Apple TN2127, available at
http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2127.html
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Elad Efrat Aq elad@NetBSD.org
implemented the kernel authorization framework in
.Nx .

provided guidance and answered questions about the Darwin implementation.
.Sh ONE MORE THING
The
.Nm
framework is dedicated to Brian Mitchell, one of the most talented people
I know.
Thanks for everything.
