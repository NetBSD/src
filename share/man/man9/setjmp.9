.Sh NAME
.Nm setjmp ,
.Nm longjmp
.Nd non-local jumps
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include \*[Lt]machine/types.h\*[Gt]
.Fd #include \*[Lt]sys/systm.h\*[Gt]
.Ft int
.Fn setjmp "label_t *label"
.Ft void
.Fn longjmp "label_t *label"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn setjmp
function saves its calling environment in
.Fa label .
It returns zero on success.  The
.Fn longjmp
function restores the environment saved by the most recent
invocation of
.Fn setjmp .
It returns so that kernel execution continues as if
the corresponding invocation of the
.Fn setjmp
had just returned.
.Pp
.Fn setjmp
and
.Fn longjmp
are a machine-independent interface for machine-dependent
implementations.
.Pp
These functions are primarily used by
.Xr ddb 4 .
