.Sh NAME
.Nm cpu_initclocks
.Nd machine-dependent clock setup interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include \*[Lt]sys/systm.h\*[Gt]
.Ft void
.Fn cpu_initclocks "void"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn cpu_initclocks
is invoked by
.Fn initclocks
during system bootstrap, immediately after autoconfiguration, to
perform the machine-dependent initialisation of clock frequencies and
start the real-time and statistic clocks running.
.Sh CODE REFERENCES
This section describes places within the
.Nx
source tree where actual code implementing or utilising the
machine-dependent clocks initialisation interface can be found.  All
pathnames are relative to
.Pa /usr/src .
.Pp
Machine-independent clock interface operations are performed within
the file
.Pa sys/kern/kern_clock.c .
