.Ft int
.Fn imin "int a" "int b"
.Ft long
.Fn lmax "long a" "long b"
.Ft long
.Fn lmin "long a" "long b"
.Ft u_int
.Fn max "u_int a" "u_int b"
.Ft u_int
.Fn min "u_int a" "u_int b"
.Ft u_long
.Fn ulmax "u_long a" "u_long b"
.Ft u_long
.Fn ulmin "u_long a" "u_long b"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn imin ,
.Fn lmin ,
.Fn min ,
and
.Fn ulmin
functions return whichever argument is algebraically smaller, differing only
in their argument and return types: these functions operate on, respectively,
natural size, long, unsigned and unsigned long integers.
.Pp
The
.Fn imax ,
.Fn lmax ,
.Fn max ,
and
.Fn ulmax
functions are identical except that they return the algebraically larger
argument between
.Ar a
and
.Ar b .
