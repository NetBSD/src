.Dt KLUA_MOD_REGISTER 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm klua_mod_register ,
.Nm klua_mod_unregister
.Nd Lua kernel bindings
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/lua.h
.Ft void
.Fn klua_mod_register "const char *name" "lua_CFunction open"
.Ft void
.Fn klua_mod_unregister "const char *name"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Lua kernel bindings are designed to provide functionality to Lua scripts
not available in the language itself, e.g. to access core kernel functionality.
This mechanism is utilizing the lua_modules functionality.
.Pp
The lua_module structure is declared as follows:
.Bd -literal
struct lua_module {
        char                    mod_name[LUA_MAX_MODNAME];
        lua_CFunction           open;
        int                     refcount;
        LIST_ENTRY(lua_module)  mod_next;
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Ft mod_name
defines the unique name of a module.
A C function must use the standard Lua protocol in order to communicate with
Lua, this is part is maintained with the
.Ft open
element in the standard Lua way.
.Ft refcount
protects the module from unplogging it when in use.
The last parameter
.Ft mod_next
is used for the standard container
.Xr LIST 3 .
.Pp
The
.Fn klua_mod_register
function registers new function available to the
.Xr lua 9
device and possible to be used in a Lua code by the
.Dv require
directive.
.Dv require
might be used by
.Xr luactl 8
or by the special meaning of the
.Dv require
in the kernel Lua version.
The
.Fa name
parameter is a unique identifier of the kernel Lua module.
.Fa open
points to a function used in the C and Lua cooperation,
defined with the appropriate standard Lua API.
.Pp
Once registered a C function must be deregistered with the
.Fn klua_mod_unregister
function.
This function takes as its parameter the unique literal identifier of the
extending module.
.Sh EXAMPLES
A set of example modules is available in the
.Pa src/sys/modules/examples
directory hierarchy.
