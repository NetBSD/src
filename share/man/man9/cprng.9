.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
family of functions supply randomness to callers within the
.Nx
kernel.
They replace the
.Xr arc4random 9
and
.Xr rnd_extract_data 9
functions for this purpose.
The
.Nm
functions provide stream generators automatically keyed (and if
necessary rekeyed) from the kernel entropy pool.
The
.Nx
kernel no longer supports direct reading from the kernel entropy pool; all
access is mediated by the
.Nm
functions.
.Pp
The
.Dq strong
family of functions supply cryptographically strong random numbers
suitable for keying crypto systems and similar purposes.
Calls to
.Xr rnd_extract_data 9
should be replaced with calls to
.Nm cprng_strong .
.Pp
The
.Dq fast
family of functions supply less strong random numbers, suitable for
initialization vectors, nonces in certain protocols, and other
similar purposes, using a faster but less secure stream-cipher generator.
stream-cipher generator.
Calls to
.Xr arc4random 9
should be replaced with calls to
.Nm cprng_fast32 ,
and calls to
.Xr arc4randbytes 9
should be replaced with calls to
.Nm cprng_fast .
.Pp
A single instance of the
.Nm cprng_fast
generator serves the entire kernel.
A single, well-known instance of the
.Nm cprng_strong
generator,
.Dv kern_cprng ,
may be used by any in-kernel caller, but
new separately-keyed instances of the
.Nm cprng_strong
generator can also be created by calling
.Nm cprng_strong_create .
.Sh FUNCTIONS
.Bl -tag -width abcd
.It Fn cprng_strong_create "name" "ipl" "flags"
.Pp
Create an instance of the cprng_strong generator.
This generator
implements the NIST SP 800-90 CTR_DRBG with AES128 as the block transform.
The
.Fa name
argument is used to "personalize" the CTR_DRBG according to the standard,
so that its initial state will depend both on keying material from the
entropy pool and also on the personalization string (name).
The
.Fa ipl
argument specifies the interrupt priority level for the mutex which will
serialize access to the new instance of the generator (see
.Xr spl 9 ) .
The
.Fa flags
argument controls the behavior of the generator:
.Bl -tag -width CPRNG_REKEY_ANY
.It Dv CPRNG_INIT_ANY
Perform initial keying of the generator from the entropy pool even if
the current estimate of entropy in the pool is less than the required
number of key bits for the generator.
.It Dv CPRNG_REKEY_ANY
When rekeying of the generator is required, key the generator from the
entropy pool even if the current estimate of entropy in the pool is less
than the required number of key bits for the generator.
.It Dv CPRNG_USE_CV
Perform a
.Xr cv_broadcast 9
operation on the "cv" member of the returned cprng_strong_t each time
the generator is successfully rekeyed.
.Em If this flag is set, the generator will sleep when rekeying is needed,
.Em and will therefore always return the requested number of bytes.
.El
.Pp
Creation will succeed even if key material for the generator is not
available.
In this case, the first request to read from the generator
may cause rekeying.
.It Fn cprng_strong_destroy "cprng"
.Pp
Destroy an instance of the cprng_strong generator.
.It Fn cprng_strong "cprng" "buf" "len" "blocking"
.Pp
Fill memory location
.Fa buf
with
.Fa len
bytes from the generator
.Fa cprng .
The
.Fa blocking
argument controls the blocking/non-blocking behavior of the
generator: if it is set to FNONBLOCK, the generator may return
less than
.Fa len
bytes if it requires rekeying.
If the
.Dv CPRNG_USE_CV
flag is set on the generator, the caller can wait on
.Dv cprng->cv
for notification that the generator can again supply bytes.
A maximum of
.Dv CPRNG_MAX_LEN
bytes may be requested at once; this is a restriction of the
CTR_DRBG specification.
.It Fn cprng_strong32 "cprng"
.Pp
Generate 32 bits using cprng_strong generator
.Fa cprng .
.It Fn cprng_strong64 "cprng"
.Pp
Generate 64 bits using cprng_strong generator
.Fa cprng .
.It Fn cprng_strong_getflags "cprng"
.Pp
Get the flags currently in use by generator
.Fa cprng .
.It Fn cprng_strong_setflags "cprng" "flags"
Set the flags on generator
.Fa cprng
to
.Fa flags .
.It Fn cprng_fast "buf" "len"
Fill memory location
.Fa buf
with
.Fa len
bytes from the fast generator.
.It Fn cprng_fast32
Generate 32 bits using the fast generator.
.It Fn cprng_fast64
Generate 64 bits using the fast generator.

The
.Dq strong
generator uses the CTR_DRBG implementation in
.Pa sys/crypto/nist_ctr_drbg .
The
