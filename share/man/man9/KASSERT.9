.Sh NAME
.Nm KASSERT ,
.Nm KDASSERT
.Nd kernel expression verification macros
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ft void
.Fn KASSERT expression
.Ft void
.Fn KDASSERT expression
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These machine independent assertion-checking macros cause a kernel
.Xr panic 9
if the given
.Ar expression
evaluates to false.
.Pp
.Fn KASSERT
tests are included only in kernels compiled with the
.Dv DIAGNOSTIC
configuration option.
In a kernel that does not have this configuration option, the
.Fn KASSERT
macro is defined to be a no-op.
.Pp
.Fn KDASSERT
tests are included only in kernels compiled with the
.Dv DEBUG
configuration option.
.Fn KDASSERT
and
.Fn KASSERT
are identical except for the controlling option
.Pf ( Dv DEBUG
vs
.Dv DIAGNOSTIC ) .
.Pp
The panic message will display the style of assertion (debugging
vs. diagnostic), the expression that failed and the filename, and line
number the failure happened on.
