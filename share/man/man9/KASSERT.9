.Sh NAME
.Nm KASSERT ,
.Nm KDASSERT
.Nd kernel expression verification macros
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ft void
.Fn KASSERT expression
.Ft void
.Fn KDASSERT expression
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These machine independent assertion-checking macros cause a kernel
.Xr panic 9
if the given
.Ar expression
evaluates to false.
.Pp
.Fn KASSERT
tests are included only in kernels compiled with the
.Dv DIAGNOSTIC
configuration option.
In a kernel that does not have this configuration option, the
.Fn KASSERT
macro is defined to be a no-op.
.Pp
.Fn KDASSERT
tests are included only in kernels compiled with the
.Dv DEBUG
configuration option.
.Fn KDASSERT
and
.Fn KASSERT
are identical except for the controlling option
.Pf ( Dv DEBUG
vs
.Dv DIAGNOSTIC ) .
.Pp
Basically,
.Fn KASSERT
should be used for light-weight checks and
.Fn KDASSERT
should be used for heavier ones.
.Pp
Callers should not rely on the side effects of
.Ar expression
because, depending on the kernel compile options mentioned above,
.Ar expression
might not be evaluated at all.
.Pp
The panic message will display the style of assertion (debugging
vs. diagnostic), the expression that failed and the filename, and line
number the failure happened on.
