.Sh NAME
.Nm ts2timo
.Nd convert time interval to tick count
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/timevar.h
.Ft int
.Fn ts2timo "clock_id clock_id" "int flags" "struct timespec *ts" "int *timo" "struct timespec *start"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ts2timo
function converts the time interval specified in
.Fa ts
into the integral number of system ticks that would elapse (including the
current tick) and places the result in
.Fa timo .
The interval type is specified in the
.Fa flags
argument and can be either
.Dv TIMER_ABSTIME
or
.Dv TIMER_RELTIME .
If the interval is specified as an absolute time, then the
.Fa clock_id
clock is used to convert it to a relative time.
If the
.Fa start
argument is not
.Dv NULL ,
then current time for the
.Fa clock_id
clock is placed in that argument.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success
.Fn ts2timo
returns
.Dv 0 .
On failure it returns
.Er ETIMEDOUT
if  interval computed was
.Dv 0
or negative, and
.Er EINVAL
if
.Fa ts->tv_usec
field in the computed interval is out of range, or the
.Fa clock_id
argument is invalid.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr clock_gettime 2 ,
.Xr clock_nanosleep 2
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
function first appeared in
.Nx 7.0 .
