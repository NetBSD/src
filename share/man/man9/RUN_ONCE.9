.\" ------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn RUN_ONCE
provides a functionality similar to
.Xr pthread_once 3 .
It ensures that, for a given
.Fa control ,
.Fn init_func
is executed (successfully) exactly once.
It is considered as a successful execution if and only if
.Fn init_func
returned 0.
As long as there was no successful execution,
.Fn RUN_ONCE
will try again each time it is called.
.Pp
.Fn RUN_ONCE
can sleep if it's called concurrently.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On failure,
.Fn RUN_ONCE
returns what
.Fn init_func
returned.
Otherwise, it returns 0.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example shows how
.Fn RUN_ONCE
is used.
Regardless of how many times
.Fn some_func
is executed,
.Fn init_func
will be executed exactly once.
.Bd -literal
static int
init_func(void)
{

	/*
	 * do some initialization.
	 */

	return 0; /* success */
}

int
some_func(void)
{
	static ONCE_DECL(control);

	RUN_ONCE(&control, init_func);

	/*
	 * we are sure that init_func has already been completed here.
	 */
}
