.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
provides a simple and convenient API for device drivers to load firmware
images from files residing in the file system that are necessary for the
devices that they control.
Firmware images reside in sub-directories, one for each driver, of a series
of colon-separated path prefixes specified by the sysctl variable
.Dv hw.firmware.path .
.Sh FUNCTIONS
The following functions are provided by the
.Nm
API:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fn "firmware_open" "drvname" "imgname" "fhp"
.Pp
Open the firmware image
.Fa imgname
for the driver
.Fa drvname .
The path to the firmware image file is constructed by appending the string
.Dq "/drvname/imgname"
to each configured path prefix until opening the firmware image file succeeds.
Upon success,
.Fn firmware_open
returns 0 and stores a firmware image handle in the location pointed to by
.Fa fhp .
Otherwise, an error code is returned to indicate the reason for failure.
.It Fn "firmware_close" "fh"
.Pp
Close the firmware image file associated with the firmware handle
.Fa fh .
Returns 0 upon success or an error code to indicate the reason for failure.
.It Fn "firmware_get_size" "fh"
.Pp
Returns the size of the image file associated with the firmware handle
.Fa fh .
.It Fn "firmware_read" "fh" "offset" "buf" "size"
.Pp
Reads from the image file associated with the firmware handle
.Fa fh
beginning at offset
.Fa offset
for length
.Fa size .
The firmware image data is placed into the buffer specified by
.Fa buf .
Returns 0 upon success or an error code to indicate the reason for failure.
.It Fn "firmware_malloc" "size"
.Pp
Allocates a region of wired kernel memory of size
.Fa size .
Note:
.Fn firmware_malloc
may block.
.It Fn "firmware_free" "buf" "size"
.Pp
Frees a region of memory previously allocated by
.Fn firmware_malloc .
