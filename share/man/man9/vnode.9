.Sh DESCRIPTION
A
.Em vnode
represents an on-disk file in use by the system.
Each
.Xr vfs 9
file system provides a set of
.Xr vnodeops 9
operations on vnodes, invoked by file-system-independent system calls
and supported by file-system-independent library routines.
.Pp
Each mounted file system provides a vnode for the root of the file
system, via
.Xr VFS_ROOT 9 .
Other vnodes are obtained by
.Xr VOP_LOOKUP 9 .
Users of vnodes usually invoke these indirectly via
.Xr namei 9
to obtain vnodes from paths.
.Pp
Each file system usually maintains a cache mapping recently used inode
numbers, or the equivalent, to vnodes, and a cache mapping recently
used file names to vnodes.
If memory is scarce, the system may decide to
.Em reclaim
an unused cached vnode, calling
.Xr VOP_RECLAIM 9
to remove it from the caches and to free file-system-specific memory
associated with it.
A file system may also choose to immediately reclaim a cached vnode
once it is unused, in
.Xr VOP_INACTIVE 9 ,
if the vnode has been deleted on disk.
.Pp
When a file system retrieves a vnode from a cache, the vnode may not
have any users, and another thread in the system may be simultaneously
deciding to reclaim it.
Thus, to retrieve a vnode from a cache, one must use
.Fn vcache_get ,
not
.Fn vref ,
to acquire the first reference.
.Pp
The vnode has the following structure:
.Bd -literal
struct vnode {
	struct uvm_object v_uobj;		/* the VM object */
	kcondvar_t	v_cv;			/* synchronization */
	voff_t		v_size;			/* size of file */
	voff_t		v_writesize;		/* new size after write */
	int		v_iflag;		/* VI_* flags */
	int		v_vflag;		/* VV_* flags */
	int		v_uflag;		/* VU_* flags */
	int		v_numoutput;		/* # of pending writes */
	int		v_writecount;		/* ref count of writers */
	int		v_holdcnt;		/* page & buffer refs */
	struct mount	*v_mount;		/* ptr to vfs we are in */
	int		(**v_op)(void *);	/* vnode operations vector */
	struct buflists	v_cleanblkhd;		/* clean blocklist head */
	struct buflists	v_dirtyblkhd;		/* dirty blocklist head */
	union {
		struct mount	*vu_mountedhere;/* ptr to vfs (VDIR) */
		struct socket	*vu_socket;	/* unix ipc (VSOCK) */
		struct specnode	*vu_specnode;	/* device (VCHR, VBLK) */
		struct fifoinfo	*vu_fifoinfo;	/* fifo (VFIFO) */
		struct uvm_ractx *vu_ractx;	/* read-ahead ctx (VREG) */
	} v_un;
	enum vtype	v_type;			/* vnode type */
	enum vtagtype	v_tag;			/* type of underlying data */
	void 		*v_data;		/* private data for fs */
	struct klist	v_klist;		/* notes attached to vnode */
};
.Ed
.Pp
Most members of the vnode structure should be treated as opaque and
only manipulated using the proper functions.
There are some rather common exceptions detailed throughout this page.
.Pp
Files and file systems are inextricably linked with the virtual memory
system and
.Em v_uobj
contains the data maintained by the virtual memory system.
For compatibility with code written before the integration of
.Xr uvm 9
into
.Nx ,
C-preprocessor directives are used to alias the members of
.Em v_uobj .
.Pp
Vnode flags are recorded by
.Em v_iflag ,
.Em v_vflag
and
.Em v_uflag .
Valid flags are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width ".Dv VI_WRMAPDIRTY" -compact
.It Dv VV_ROOT
This vnode is the root of its file system.
.It Dv VV_SYSTEM
This vnode is being used by the kernel; only used to skip quota files in
.Fn vflush .
.It Dv VV_ISTTY
This vnode represents a tty; used when reading dead vnodes.
.It Dv VV_MAPPED
This vnode might have user mappings.
.It Dv VV_MPSAFE
This file system is MP safe.
.It Dv VV_LOCKSWORK
This vnode's file system supports locking.
.It Dv VI_TEXT
This vnode is a pure text prototype.
.It Dv VI_EXECMAP
This vnode has executable mappings.
.It Dv VI_WRMAP
This vnode might have PROT_WRITE user mappings.
.It Dv VI_WRMAPDIRTY
This vnode might have dirty pages due to
.Dv VWRITEMAP .
.It Dv VI_XLOCK
This vnode is currently locked to change underlying type.
.It Dv VI_ONWORKLST
This vnode is on syncer work-list.
.It Dv VI_MARKER
A dummy marker vnode.
.It Dv VI_CLEAN
This vnode has been reclaimed and is no longer attached to a file system.
.It Dv VU_DIROP
This vnode is involved in a directory operation.
This flag is used exclusively by LFS.
.El
.Pp
The
.Dv VI_XLOCK
flag is used to prevent multiple processes from entering
the vnode reclamation code.
It is also used as a flag to indicate that reclamation is in progress.
Before
.Em v_iflag
can be modified, the
.Em v_interlock
mutex must be acquired.
See
.Xr lock 9
for details on the kernel locking API.
.Pp
Each vnode has three reference counts:
.Em v_usecount ,
.Em v_writecount
and
.Em v_holdcnt .
The first is the number of active references within the
kernel to the vnode.
This count is maintained by
.Fn vref ,
.Fn vrele ,
.Fn vrele_async ,
and
.Fn vput .
The second is the number of active references within the kernel to the
vnode performing write access to the file.
It is maintained by the
.Xr open 2
and
.Xr close 2
system calls.
The third is the number of references within the kernel
requiring the vnode to remain active and not be recycled.
This count is maintained by
.Fn vhold
and
.Fn holdrele .
When both the
.Em v_usecount
and
.Em v_holdcnt
reach zero, the vnode is cached.
The transition from the cache is handled by a kernel thread and
.Fn vrecycle .
Access to
.Em v_usecount ,
.Em v_writecount
and
.Em v_holdcnt
is also protected by the
.Em v_interlock
mutex.
.Pp
The number of pending synchronous and asynchronous writes on the
vnode are recorded in
.Em v_numoutput .
It is used by
.Xr fsync 2
to wait for all writes to complete before returning to the user.
Its value must only be modified at splbio (see
.Xr spl 9 ) .
It does not track the number of dirty buffers attached to the
vnode.
.Pp
The link to the file system which owns the vnode is recorded by
.Em v_mount .
See
.Xr vfsops 9
for further information of file system mount status.
.Pp
The
.Em v_op
pointer points to its vnode operations vector.
This vector describes what operations can be done to the file associated
with the vnode.
The system maintains one vnode operations vector for each file system
type configured into the kernel.
The vnode operations vector contains a pointer to a function for
each operation supported by the file system.
See
.Xr vnodeops 9
for a description of vnode operations.
.Pp
When a user wants a new vnode for another file or wants a valid vnode
which is cached,
.Fn vcache_get
or
.Fn vcache_new
is invoked to allocate a vnode and initialize it for the new file.
.Pp
The type of object the vnode represents is recorded by
.Em v_type .
It is used by generic code to perform checks to ensure operations are
performed on valid file system objects.
Valid types are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width VFIFO -compact
.It Dv VNON
The vnode has no type.
.It Dv VREG
The vnode represents a regular file.
.It Dv VDIR
The vnode represents a directory.
.It Dv VBLK
The vnode represents a block special device.
.It Dv VCHR
The vnode represents a character special device.
.It Dv VLNK
The vnode represents a symbolic link.
.It Dv VSOCK
The vnode represents a socket.
.It Dv VFIFO
The vnode represents a pipe.
.It Dv VBAD
The vnode represents a bad file (not currently used).
.El
.Pp
Vnode tag types are used by external programs only (e.g.,
.Xr pstat 8 ) ,
and should never be inspected by the kernel.
Its use is deprecated
since new
.Em v_tag
values cannot be defined for loadable file systems.
The
.Em v_tag
member is read-only.
Valid tag types are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width "VT_FILECORE " -compact
.It Dv VT_NON
non file system
.It Dv VT_UFS
universal file system
.It Dv VT_NFS
network file system
.It Dv VT_MFS

.El
.Pp
The vnode lock is acquired by calling
.Xr vn_lock 9
and released by calling
.Xr VOP_UNLOCK 9 .
The reason for this asymmetry is that
.Xr vn_lock 9
is a wrapper for
.Xr VOP_LOCK 9
with extra checks, while the unlocking step usually does not need
additional checks and thus has no wrapper.
.Pp
The vnode locking operation is complicated because it is used for many
purposes.
Sometimes it is used to bundle a series of vnode operations (see
.Xr vnodeops 9 )
into an atomic group.
Many file systems rely on it to prevent race conditions in updating
file system type specific data structures rather than using their
own private locks.
The vnode lock can operate as a multiple-reader (shared-access lock)
or single-writer lock (exclusive access lock), however many current file
system implementations were written assuming only single-writer
locking.
Multiple-reader locking functions equivalently only in the presence
of big-lock SMP locking or a uni-processor machine.
The lock may be held while sleeping.
While the vnode lock is acquired, the holder is guaranteed that the
vnode will not be reclaimed or invalidated.
Most file system functions require that you hold the vnode lock on entry.
See
.Xr lock 9
for details on the kernel locking API.
.Pp
Each file system underlying a vnode allocates its own private area and
hangs it from
.Em v_data .
.Pp
Most functions discussed in this page that operate on vnodes cannot be
called from interrupt context.
The members
.Em v_numoutput ,
.Em v_holdcnt ,
.Em v_dirtyblkhd ,
and
.Em v_cleanblkhd
are modified in interrupt context and must be protected by
.Xr splbio 9
unless it is certain that there is no chance an interrupt handler will
modify them.
The vnode lock must not be acquired within interrupt context.
.Sh FUNCTIONS
.Bl -tag -width compact
.It Fn vref "vp"
Increment
.Em v_usecount
of the vnode
.Em vp .
Any kernel thread system which uses a vnode (e.g., during the operation
of some algorithm or to store in a data structure) should call
.Fn vref .
.It Fn vrele "vp"
Decrement
.Em v_usecount
of unlocked vnode
.Em vp .
Any code in the system which is using a vnode should call
.Fn vrele
when it is finished with the vnode.
If
.Em v_usecount
of the vnode reaches zero and
.Em v_holdcnt
is greater than zero, the vnode is placed on the holdlist.
If both
.Em v_usecount
and
.Em v_holdcnt
are zero, the vnode is cached.
.It Fn vrele_async "vp"
Will asynchronously release the vnode in different context than the caller,
sometime after the call.

.Sh BUGS
The locking protocol is inconsistent.
Many vnode operations are passed locked vnodes on entry but release
the lock before they exit.
The locking protocol is used in some places to attempt to make a
series of operations atomic (e.g., access check then operation).
This does not work for non-local file systems that do not support locking
(e.g., NFS).
The
.Nm
interface would benefit from a simpler locking protocol.
