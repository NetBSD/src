.Sh NAME
.Nm cpu_rootconf ,
.Nm rootconf ,
.Nm setroot
.Nd root file system setup
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/systm.h
.Ft void
.Fn cpu_rootconf "void"
.Ft void
.Fn rootconf "void"
.Ft void
.Fn setroot "device_t bootdv" "int bootpartition"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn cpu_rootconf
is a machine-dependent interface invoked during system bootstrap to
determine the root file system device and initialize machine-dependent
file system state.
.Fn cpu_rootconf
provides the global variables
.Fa booted_device ,
.Fa booted_partition ,
.Fa booted_startblk ,
and
.Fa booted_nblks
and invokes the machine-independent function
.Fa rootconf
which
.Fa rootconf
then calls the function
.Fa setroot
to record the boot/root device and the boot partition information
for use in machine-independent code.
.Pp
For disk boot, if
.Fa booted_nblks
is not 0, then
.Fa booted_startblk
and
.Fa booted_nblks
are supposed to specify a disk wedge that is used as the root device.
Otherwise the
.Fa booted_partition
is used.
