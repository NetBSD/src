.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions are used to control kernel preemption of the calling LWP.
.Pp
Kernel preemption is currently disabled by default.
It can be enabled by tweaking kern.sched.kpreempt_pri sysctl.
.Pp
.Fn kpreempt_disable
disables kernel preemption of the calling LWP.
Note that disabling kernel preemption can prevent LWPs with higher priorities
from running.
.Pp
.Fn kpreempt_enable
enables kernel preemption of the calling LWP, which was previously disabled by
.Fn kpreempt_disable .
.Pp
.Fn kpreempt_disable
and
.Fn kpreempt_enable
can be nested.
.Pp
.Fn kpreempt_disabled
returns
.Dv true
if preemption of the calling LWP is disabled.
It's for diagnostic purpose.
