.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
module is a component of the
.Xr wscons 9
framework to provide access to display fonts.  Fonts may be loaded
dynamically into the kernel or included statically in the kernel at
compile time.  Display drivers which emulate a glass-tty console on a
bit-mapped display can add, remove and find fonts for use by
device-dependent blitter operations.
.Pp
The primary data type for manipulating fonts is the
.Em wsdisplay_font
structure in
.Pa dev/wscons/wsconsio.h :
.Bd -literal
struct wsdisplay_font {
	char *name;		/* font name */
	int firstchar;
	int numchars;		/* size of font table */
	int encoding;		/* font encoding
	u_int fontwidth;	/* character width */
	u_int fontheight;	/* character width */
	u_int stride;
	int bitorder;
	int byteorder;
	void *data;		/* pointer to font table */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The maximum font table size is
.Em WSDISPLAY_MAXFONTSZ .
.Pp
The
.Nm
framework supports fonts with the following encodings:
.Bl -tag -width compact
.It WSDISPLAY_FONTENC_ISO
ISO-encoded fonts.
.It WSDISPLAY_FONTENC_IBM
IBM-encoded fonts commonly available for IBM CGA, EGA and VGA display
adapters.
.It WSDISPLAY_FONTENC_PCVT
PCVT-encoding fonts distributed as part of the old PCVT terminal
emulation driver.
.It WSDISPLAY_FONTENC_ISO7
ISO-encoded Greek fonts.
.It WSDISPLAY_FONTENC_ISO2
ISO-encoded East European fonts.
.El
.Sh FUNCTIONS
.Bl -tag -width compact
.It Fn wsfont_init "void"
Initialise the font list with the built-in fonts.
.It Fn wsfont_matches "font" "name" "width" "height" "stride"
Matches the font
.Fa font
with the specifications
.Fa name ,
.Fa width ,
.Fa height
and
.Fa stride .
Return zero if not matched and non-zero if matched.
.It Fn wsfont_find "name" "width" "height" "stride"
Find the font called
.Fa name
from the fonts loaded into the kernel.  The font aspect is specified
by
.Fa width ,
.Fa height ,
and
.Fa stride .
If
.Fn wsfont_find
is called with any of the parameters as 0, it indicates that we don't
care about that aspect of the font.  If the font is found a
(nonnegative-valued) cookie is returned which can used with the other
functions.
.Pp
When more flexibility is required,
.Fn wsfont_enum
should be used.
.It Fn wsfont_add "font" "copy"
Add a font
.Fa font
to the font list.
If the
.Fa copy
argument is non-zero, then the font is physically copied, otherwise a
reference to the original font is made.
.It Fn wsfont_remove "cookie"
Remove the font specified by
.Fa cookie
from the font list.
The value of cookie was returned by
.Fn wsfont_add .
.It Fn wsfont_enum "callback"
Enumerate the list of fonts.  For each font in the font list, the
.Fa callback
function argument is called with the arguments specifying the font
name, width, height and stride.
.It Fn wsfont_lock "cookie" "ptr" "bitorder" "byteorder"
Lock access to the font specified by
.Fa cookie
so that it cannot be unloaded from the kernel while is being used.
The address of the wsdisplay_font pointer for the specified font is
return in the
.Fa ptr
argument.  The
.Fa bitorder
and
.Fa byteorder
arguments are the bit order and byte order required.  Valid values
are:
.Bl -tag -width compact
.It WSDISPLAY_FONTORDER_KNOWN
The font is in known ordered format and doesn't need converting.
.It WSDISPLAY_FONTORDER_L2R
The font is ordered left to right.
.It WSDISPLAY_FONTORDER_R2L
The font is ordered right to left.
.El
.Pp
.Fn wsfont_lock
returns the new lockcount on success.  The function will fail if
.Fa cookie
is invalid or if the font is already locked and the bit/byte order
requested by the caller differs.
.It Fn wsfont_unlock "cookie"
Unlock the font specified by
.Fa cookie .
Returns the new lockcount.
.It Fn wsfont_getflg "cookie" "flg" "lc"
Get font flags and lockcount for font
.Fa cookie .
The flags are returned in
.Fa flg
and the lockcount for the font in
.Fa lc .
.It Fn wsfont_map_unichar "font" "c"
Remap the unicode character
.Fa c
to glyph for font
.Fa font .
Returns the glyph or success or -1 on error.
