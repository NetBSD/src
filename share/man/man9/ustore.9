.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
functions provide a way to store a value to single memory cells in
user-space.
In each case, the value
.Ar val
is stored in the user-space memory location referenced by
.Ar uaddr .
.Pp
The
.Nm ustore_64
function is only available on systems employing the
.Sq LP64
memory model, which can be determined by testing for the presence of the
.Dv _LP64
C preprocessor macro.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm
functions return 0 on success and an error number on failure.
