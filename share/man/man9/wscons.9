.Sh NAME
.Nm wscons
.Nd machine-independent console support
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides a machine-independent framework for workstation
consoles.
It consists of several cooperating modules:
.Bl -bullet
.It
display adapters (see
.Xr wsdisplay 9 )
.It
keyboards (see
.Xr wskbd 9 )
.It
pointers and mice (see
.Xr wsmouse 9 )
.It
input event multiplexor
.It
font handling (see
.Xr wsfont 9 )
.It
terminal emulation (see
.Xr wsdisplay 9 )
.El
.Pp
The wscons framework replaces the old rcons workstation framework and
the various machine-dependent console implementations.
.Sh CODE REFERENCES
This section describes places within the
.Nx
source tree where actual code implementing or using the
machine-independent wscons subsystem can be found.
All pathnames are relative to
.Pa /usr/src .
.Pp
The wscons subsystem is implemented within the directory
.Pa sys/dev/wscons .
