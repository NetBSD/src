.Sh DESCRIPTION
The machine-independent
.Nm
interface provides capability to send inter-processor interrupts (IPIs)
amongst CPUs.
The interface has two mechanisms: asynchronous IPI to invoke functions
with a constant argument and synchronous IPIs with the cross-call support.
.Pp
Other synchronization interfaces are built using the MI IPI interface.
For a general purpose inter-processor cross-calls or remote
interrupts, use the
.Xr xcall 9
or
.Xr softint 9
interfaces.
.Pp
The primary use cases of the MI IPIs include the following:
.Bl -hyphen -compact
.It
provide a facility for the
.Xr softint 9
subsystem to schedule software interrupts on remote CPUs
.It
provide a facility for the
.Xr xcall 9
subsystem
.It
abstract IPI handling and facilitate machine-dependent code
.El
.\" -----
.Ss Asynchronous IPI interface
This interface allows dynamic registration of IPI handlers with a constant
argument and asynchronous triggering of interrupts.
.Bl -tag -width compact
.It Fn ipi_register "func" "arg"
Register an IPI handler
.Fa func
with an arbitrary argument
.Fa arg .
Returns a non-zero IPI identifier on success and zero on failure.
.It Fn ipi_unregister "ipi_id"
Unregister the IPI handler identified by the
.Fa ipi_id .
.It Fn ipi_trigger "ipi_id" "ci"
Trigger an IPI identified by
.Fa ipi_id
on a remote CPU specified by
.Fa ci .
This function must be called with the kernel preemption disabled and
the target CPU must be remote.
.El
.\" -----
.Ss Synchronous IPI interface
This interface provides capability to perform cross-calls, i.e. invoke
an arbitrary function on a remote CPU.
The invocations are performed synchronously and the caller must wait
for completion.
The cross-call is described by an IPI "message".
The caller has to fill in an
.Vt ipi_msg_t
structure which has the following public members:
.Bd -literal
        ipi_func_t	func;
        void		arg;
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Ar func
member specifies a function to invoke and
.Ar arg
is the argument to be passed to the function.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width compact
.It Fn ipi_unicast "msg" "ci"
Send an IPI to a remote CPU specified by
.Fa ci .
.It Fn ipi_multicast "msg" "target"
Send IPIs to a CPU set specified by
.Fa target .
.It Fn ipi_broadcast "msg"
Send IPIs to all CPUs.
.It Fn ipi_wait "msg"
Wait until all IPIs complete.
.El
.Pp
All described functions, except
.Fn ipi_wait ,
must be called with the kernel preemption disabled.
All synchronous IPI invocations must be completed (wait for them with the
.Fn ipi_wait
function) before the IPI message structure can be destroyed or new
cross-call requests can be performed.
.\" -----
.Sh NOTES
Functions being called must be lightweight.
They run at
.Dv IPL_HIGH
and should generally not use any other synchronization interfaces
such as
.Xr mutex 9 .
If spin-locks are used, they must be used carefully and have no contention.
