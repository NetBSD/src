.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
subsystem is a set of operations for the management of device buffer queues.
.Pp
The primary data type for using the operations is the
.Em bufq_state
structure, which is opaque for users.
.Sh FUNCTIONS
.Bl -tag -width compact
.It Fn bufq_alloc "bufq" "strategy" "flags"
Allocate and initialize a
.Em bufq_state
descriptor.
.Pp
The argument
.Fa strategy
specifies a buffer queue strategy to be used for this buffer queue.
The following special values can be used:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width BUFQ_DISK_DEFAULT_STRAT -compact
.It Dv BUFQ_STRAT_ANY
Let
.Fn bufq_alloc
select a strategy.
.It Dv BUFQ_DISK_DEFAULT_STRAT
Let
.Fn bufq_alloc
select a strategy, assuming it will be used for a normal disk device.
.El
.Pp
Valid bits for the
.Fa flags
are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width BUFQ_SORT_RAWBLOCK -compact
.It Dv BUFQ_SORT_RAWBLOCK
sort by
.Em b_rawblkno
.It Dv BUFQ_SORT_CYLINDER
sort by
.Em b_cylinder
and then by
.Em b_rawblkno
.It Dv BUFQ_EXACT
Fail if a strategy specified by
.Fa strategy
is not available.
In that case,
.Fa bufq_alloc
returns
.Dv ENOENT .
If this flag is not specified,
.Fn bufq_alloc
will silently use one of available strategies.
.El
.It Fn bufq_drain "bufq"
Drain a
.Em bufq_state
descriptor.
.It Fn bufq_free "bufq"
Destroy a
.Em bufq_state
descriptor.
.It Fn bufq_getstrategyname "bufq"
Get a strategy identifier of a buffer queue, the
string returned will be NUL-terminated and it always
will be a valid strategy name. 
.It Fn bufq_move "dst" "src"
Move all requests from the buffer queue
.Fa src
to the buffer queue
.Fa dst .
.It Fn BUFQ_PUT "bufq" "bp"
Put the buf
.Fa bp
in the queue.
.It Fn BUFQ_GET "bufq"
Get the next buf from the queue and remove it from the queue.
Returns
.Dv NULL
if the queue is empty.
.It Fn BUFQ_PEEK "bufq"
Get the next buf from the queue without removal.
The next buf will remain the same until
.Fn BUFQ_GET ,
.Fn BUFQ_PUT ,
or
.Fn bufq_drain
is called.
Returns
.Dv NULL
if the queue is empty.
.El
