.Nd device buffer queues
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In buf.h
.Ft void
.Fn bufq_alloc "struct bufq_state *bufq" "int flags"
.Ft void
.Fn bufq_free "struct bufq_state *bufq"
.Ft void
.Fn BUFQ_PUT "struct bufq_state *bufq" "struct buf *bp"
.Ft "struct buf *"
.Fn BUFQ_GET "struct bufq_state *bufq"
.Ft "struct buf *"
.Fn BUFQ_PEEK "struct bufq_state *bufq"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
subsystem is a set of operations for the management of device buffer queues.
.Pp
The primary data type for using the operations is the
.Em bufq_state
structure in
.Pa buf.h :
.Bd -literal
struct bufq_state {
	void (*bq_put)(struct bufq_state *, struct buf *);
	struct buf *(*bq_get)(struct bufq_state *, int);
	void *bq_private;
	int bq_flags;		/* Flags from bufq_alloc() */
};
.Ed
.Pp
Valid values for the
.Em flags
argument are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width BUFQ_SORT_RAWBLOCK -compact
.It Dv BUFQ_SORT_RAWBLOCK
sort by
.Em b_rawblkno
.It Dv BUFQ_SORT_CYLINDER
sort by
.Em b_cylinder
and then by
.Em b_rawblkno
.It Dv BUFQ_FCFS
queue strategy is first-come first-serve
.It Dv BUFQ_DISKSORT
queue strategy is min seek sort
.It Dv BUFQ_READ_PRIO
queue strategy is min seek sort for writes and first-come first-serve
for reads with read priority
.It Dv BUFQ_PRIOCSCAN
queue strategy is per-priority cyclical scan
.El
.Sh FUNCTIONS
.Bl -tag -width compact
.It Fn bufq_alloc "bufq" "flags"
Initialize a
.Em bufq_state
descriptor.
The argument
.Fa flags
controls the strategy and sort order.
.It Fn bufq_free "bufq"
Destroy a
.Em bufq_state
descriptor.
.It Fn BUFQ_PUT "bufq" "bp"
Put the buf
.Fa bp
in the queue.
.It Fn BUFQ_GET "bufq"
Get the next buf from the queue and remove it from the queue.
Returns
.Dv NULL
if the queue is empty.
.It Fn BUFQ_PEEK "bufq"
Get the next buf from the queue without removal.
The next buf will remain the same until
.Fn BUFQ_GET
is called.
Returns
.Dv NULL
if the queue is empty.
.El
