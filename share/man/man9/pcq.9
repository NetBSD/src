.Sh DESCRIPTION
The machine-independent
.Nm
framework provides producer/consumer queues.
A queue
.Po
.Vt pcq_t
.Pc
allows multiple writers
.Pq producers
but only a single reader
.Pq consumer .
Compare-and-store operations are used to allow lockless updates.
The consumer is expected to be protected by a mutex that covers
the structure that the
.Vt pcq_t
is embedded into
.Po
e.g., socket lock, ifnet hwlock
.Pc .
These queues operate in a first-in, first-out
.Pq FIFO
manner.
The act of inserting or removing an item from a
.Vt pcq_t
does not modify the item in any way.
.Nm
does not prevent an item being inserted multiple times into a single
.Vt pcq_t .
.Sh FUNCTIONS
.Bl -tag -width compact
.It Fn pcq_create "maxlen" "kmflags"
Create a queue that can store at most
.Fa maxlen
items at one time.
.Fa kmflags
should be either
.Dv KM_SLEEP ,
if
.Fn pcq_create
should sleep until resources are available, or
.Dv KM_NOSLEEP
if it should return
.Dv NULL
if resources are unavailable.
See
.Xr kmem 9 .
.It Fn pcq_destroy "pcq"
Free the resources held by
.Fa pcq .
.It Fn pcq_get "pcq"
Remove the next item to be consumed from the queue and return
it.
If the queue is empty,
return
.Dv NULL .
.It Fn pcq_maxitems "pcq"
Return the maximum number of items that the queue can store at
any one time.
.It Fn pcq_peek "pcq"
Return the next item to be consumed from the queue but do not remove
it from the queue.
If the queue is empty,
return
.Dv NULL .
.It Fn pcq_put "pcq" "item"
Place an item at the end of the queue.
If there is no room in the queue for the item, return
.Dv false ;
otherwise, return
.Dv true .
The item must not have the value of
.Dv NULL .
