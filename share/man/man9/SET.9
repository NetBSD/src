.Sh NAME
.Nm SET
.Nd primitive bit macros
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.Ft void
.Fn SET "val" "x"
.Ft int
.Fn ISSET "val" "x"
.Ft void
.Fn CLR "val" "x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These macros define three standard bit-operations:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
.Fn SET
sets the bit
.Fa x
in
.Fa val ;
.It
.Fn CLR
clears the bit
.Fa x
in
.Fa val ;
and
.It
.Fn ISSET
returns 1 if the bit
.Fa x
is set in
.Fa val .
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr bits 3
.Sh BUGS
The rationale is to provide clarity in the source code,
but arguably these operations are clear enough without the use of the macros.
