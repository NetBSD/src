.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm 
functions provide the interface between the
.Nm 
module and the network drivers which need Ethernet support. Such
drivers must request the "ether" attribute in their "files" declaration
and call the appropriate functions as specified below.

FDDI drivers must request the "fddi" attribute in their "files"
declaration and call the functions tagged with "fddi_" or "FDDI_"
instead, where different. Some macros are shared.

Note that you also need the 
.Xr ARP 9
stuff to support IPv4 on your hardware.

.Bl -tag -width compact

.It Fn ether_ifattach

Perform the device independent, but Ethernet specific initialization of 
the interface pointed to by 
.Fa ifp .

Among other duties, this function creates a record for the link level
address in the interfaces' address list and records the link level address
pointed to by
.Fa lla
there.

You must call this function from the drivers' attach function.

.It Fn fddi_ifattach

corresponding function for FDDI devices.

.It Fn ether_addmulti
.It Fn ether_delmulti

Add (
.Fn ether_addmulti )
or delete (
.Fn ether_delmulti )
the address described by the
.Fa ifr
pointer to the Ethernet multicast list belonging to
.Fa ec .

These functions must be called from the drivers' ioctl function to
handle SIOCADDMULTI and SIOCDELMULTI requests. If they return
ENETRESET, the hardware multicast filter must be reinitialized.

These functions accept AF_UNSPEC addresses, which are interpreted as
Ethernet addresses, or AF_INET addresses. In the latter case,
INADDR_ANY is mapped to a range describing all the Ethernet address
space reserved for IPv4 multicast addresses.

.Fn ether_addmulti

returns EAFNOSUPPORT if an unsupportedd address family is specified,
or EINVAL, if a non-multicast address is specified, or ENETRESET, if
the multicast list really changed and the driver should synchronize
its hardware filter with it.

.Fn ether_delmulti

returns, in addition to the above errors, ENXIO, if the specified address
can't be found in the list of multicast addresses.

.It Fn ETHER_NEXT_MULTI
is a macro to step through all of the ether_multi records, one at a time.
The current position is remembered in 
.Fa step , 
which the caller must provide. 
.It Fn ETHER_FIRST_MULTI
must be called to initialize 
.Fa step
and get the first record.  Both macros return a NULL 
.Fa enm
when there are no remaining records.

.It Fn fddi_addmulti
.It Fn fddi_delmulti
corresponding functions for FDDI devices.

.It Fn ETHER_IS_MULTICAST

returns 1, if 
.Fa addr
points to an Ethernet/FDDI multicast (or broadcast) address. 
Implemented as a macro.

Ethernet support functions are declared in /usr/src/sys/net/if_ether.h
and defined (if not implemented as macro) in
/usr/src/sys/net/if_ethersubr.c.

FDDI support functions are declared in /usr/src/sys/net/if_fddi.h and
defined (if not implemented as macro) in /usr/src/sys/net/if_fddisubr.c.
