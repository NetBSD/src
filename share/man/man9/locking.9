.Sh NAME
.Nm locking
.Nd introduction to the kernel synchronization and interrupt control
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nx
kernel provides several synchronization and interrupt control primitives.
This manpage aims at giving an overview of these interfaces and their proper
application.
This document includes also basic kernel thread control primitives and rough
overview of the
.Nx
kernel design.
.Sh KERNEL OVERVIEW
The aim of the kernel synchronization, kernel thread, and interrupt control is:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
To control concurrent access to shared resources (critical sections).
.It
Spawn tasks from an interrupt in the thread context.
.It
Mask interrupts from threads.
.It
Scale to multiple CPUs.
.El
.Pp
There are three types of contexts in the
.Nx
kernel:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
.Em Thread context
- here run processes (represented by
.Dv struct proc )
and light-weight processes (represented by
.Dv struc lwp
and known as kernel threads).
Code in this context can sleep, block resources and posses address-space.
.It
.Em Software interrupt context
- it's limited thread context.
Code in this context must be processed shortly.
These interrupts don't possess any address space context.
Software interrupts are a way of deferring hardware interrupts to do more
expensive processing at a lower interrupt priority.
.It
.Em Hard interrupt context
- code must be processed as quickly as possible.
It's forbidden for a code here to sleep or access long-awaited resources.
.El
.Pp
The main differences between processes and kernel threads are:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
Single process can own multiple kernel threads (LWPs).
.It
Process possesses address space context to map userland address space.
.It
Processes are designed for userland executables and kernel threads for
in-kernel tasks.
The only process running in the kernel-space is
.Dv proc0
(called swapper).
.El
.Sh INTERFACES
The
.Nx
kernel is written to run across multiple unicore and multicore CPUs.
The following lists lists alphabetically.
.Ss Atomic memory operations
The
.Nm atomic_ops
family of functions provide atomic memory operations.
There are 7 classes of atomic memory operations available:
addition, logical
.Dq and ,
compare-and-swap, decrement, increment, logical
.Dq or ,
swap.
.Pp
See
.Xr atomic_ops 3 .
.Ss Condition variables
Condition variables (CVs) are used in the kernel to synchronize access to
resources that are limited (for example, memory) and to wait for pending I/O
operations to complete.
.Pp
See
.Xr condvar 9 .
.Ss Memory access barrier operations
The
.Nm membar_ops
family of functions provide memory access barrier operations necessary for
synchronization in multiprocessor execution environments that have relaxed load
and store order.
.Pp
See
.Xr membar_ops 3 .
.Ss Memory barriers
The memory barriers can be used to control the order in which memory accesses
occur, and thus the order in which those accesses become visible to other
processors.
They can be used to implement
.Dq lockless
access to data structures where the necessary barrier conditions are well
understood.
.Pp
See
.Xr mb 9 .
.Ss Mutual exclusion primitives
Thread-base adaptive mutexes.
These are lightweight,
exclusive locks that use threads as the focus of synchronization activity.
Adaptive mutexes typically behave like spinlock,
but under specific conditions an attempt to acquire an already held adaptive
mutex may cause the acquiring thread to sleep.
Sleep activity occurs rarely.
Busy-waiting is typically more efficient because mutex hold times are most
often short.
In contrast to pure spinlocks,
a thread holding an adaptive mutex may be preempted in the kernel,
which can allow for reduced latency where soft real-time application are in use
on the system.
.Pp
See
.Xr mutex 9 .
.Ss Restartable atomic sequences
Restartable atomic sequences are user code only sequences which are guaranteed
to execute without preemption.
This property is assured by checking the set of restartable atomic sequences
registered for a process during
.Xr cpu_switchto 9 .
If a process is found to have been preempted during a restartable sequence,
then its execution is rolled-back to the start of the sequence by resetting its
program counter saved in its process control block (PCB).
.Pp
See
.Xr ras 9 .
.Ss Reader / writer lock primitives
Reader / writer locks (RW locks) are used in the kernel to synchronize access
to an object among LWPs (lightweight processes) and soft interrupt handlers.
In addition to the capabilities provided by mutexes,
RW locks distinguish between read (shared) and write (exclusive) access.
.Pp
See
.Xr rwlock 9 .
.Ss Functions to modify system interrupt priority level
These functions raise and lower the interrupt priority level.
They are used by kernel code to block interrupts in critical sections,
in order to protect data structures.
.Pp
See
.Xr spl 9 .
.Ss Machine-independent software interrupt framework
The software interrupt framework is designed to provide a generic software
interrupt mechanism which can be used any time a low-priority callback is
needed.
It allows dynamic registration of software interrupts for loadable drivers and
protocol stacks,
prioritization and fair queuing of software interrupts,
and allows machine-dependent optimizations to reduce cost.
.Pp
See
.Xr softint 9 .
.Ss Functions to raise the system priority level
The
.Nm splraiseipl
function raises the system priority level to the level specified by
.Dv icookie ,
which should be a value returned by
.Xr makeiplcookie 9 .
In general, device drivers should not make use of this interface.
To ensure correct synchronization,
device drivers should use the
.Xr condvar 9 ,
.Xr mutex 9 ,
and
.Xr rwlock 9
interfaces.
.Pp
See
.Xr splraiseipl 9 .
.Ss Passive serialization mechanism
Passive serialization is a reader / writer synchronization mechanism designed
for lock-less read operations.
The read operations may happen from software interrupt at
.Dv IPL_SOFTCLOCK .
.Pp
See
.Xr pserialize 9 .
.Ss Simple do-it-in-thread-context framework
The workqueue utility routines are provided to defer work which is needed to be
processed in a thread context.
.Pp
See
.Xr workqueue 9 .
.Sh USAGE
The following table describes legal usage of the
.Nx
interfaces in different contexts.
The synchronization primitives available in more then one context
can be used to protect shared resources between these overlapping contexts.

.Sh HISTORY
The initial SMP support was introduced in the
.Nx 2.0
and was designed with the giant kernel lock.
Through
.Nx 4.0 ,
the kernel used spinlocks and a per-CPU interrupt priority level (the
.Xr spl 9
system).
These mechanisms did not lend themselves well to a multiprocessor environment
supporting kernel preemption.
The use of thread based (lock) synchronization was limited and the available
synchronization primitive (lockmgr) was inefficient and slow to execute.
In
.Nx 5.0
there were introduced massive performance improvements on multicore hardware
by Andrew Doran under a sponsorship of The
.Nx
Foundation.
.Pp
This file first appeared in
.Nx 8.0
and was inspired by the corresponding
.Nm locking
manpages from
.Fx
and
.Dx .
Already existing documentation was used to compile this manpage.
