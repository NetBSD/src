.Sh NAME
.Nm pci_intr_distribute
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In dev/pci/pcivar.h
.Ft int
.Fn pci_intr_distribute "void *ich" "const kcpuset_t *newset" \
"kcpuset_t *oldset"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function exists to assign an interrupt to a CPU.
.Pp
If a driver (or the other kernel component) wishes to assign an
interrupt to a CPU, it should pass the return value of
.Fn pci_intr_establish
as
.Fa ich
argument, and it should pass the kcpuset to which it should be
assigned as
.Fa newset .
To get the previous value, pass a
.Pf non- Dv NULL
value to
.Ft oldset .
