.Dt SYSMON_PSWITCH 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sysmon_pswitch
.Nd framework for power switches
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In dev/sysmon/sysmonvar.h
.Ft int
.Fn sysmon_pswitch_register "struct sysmon_pswitch *smpsw"
.Ft void
.Fn sysmon_pswitch_unregister "struct sysmon_pswitch *smpsw"
.Ft void
.Fn sysmon_pswitch_event "struct sysmon_pswitch *smpsw" "int event"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The machine-independent
.Nm
provides a framework for power management.
The interface has been largely superseded by the
.Xr pmf 9
framework, but
.Nm
is still used to manage power switches as well as
related mechanical adapters and buttons.
These are encapsulated in the following structure:
.Bd -literal
struct sysmon_pswitch {
	const char *smpsw_name;		/* power switch name */
	int smpsw_type;			/* power switch type */

	LIST_ENTRY(sysmon_pswitch) smpsw_list;
};
.Ed
.Pp
Unsurprisingly,
.Fa smpsw_name
specifies the name of the power switch and
.Fa smpsw_type
defines the type of it.
The following types are defined:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width PSWITCH_HK_VENDOR_BUTTON -compact -offset indent
.It PSWITCH_TYPE_POWER
.It PSWITCH_TYPE_SLEEP
.It PSWITCH_TYPE_LID
.It PSWITCH_TYPE_RESET
.It PSWITCH_TYPE_ACADAPTER
.It PSWITCH_TYPE_HOTKEY
.It PSWITCH_TYPE_RADIO
.El
.Pp
If the type is
.Dv PSWITCH_TYPE_HOTKEY ,
there are few predefined names that can be used for
.Fa smpsw_name :
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width PSWITCH_HK_VENDOR_BUTTON -compact -offset indent
.It PSWITCH_HK_DISPLAY_CYCLE
.Em display-cycle
.It PSWITCH_HK_LOCK_SCREEN
.Em lock-screen
.It PSWITCH_HK_BATTERY_INFO
.Em battery-info
.It PSWITCH_HK_EJECT_BUTTON
.Em eject-button
.It PSWITCH_HK_ZOOM_BUTTON
.Em zoom-button
.It PSWITCH_HK_VENDOR_BUTTON
.Em vendor-button
.El
.Pp
Once a power switch event has been proceeded,
.Nm
will inform the user space
.Xr powerd 8 ,
which will possibly execute a script matching the type of the power switch.
.Sh FUNCTIONS
After the
.Em sysmon_pswitch
structure has been initialized,
a new power switch device can be registered by using
.Fn sysmon_pswitch_register .
The device can be detached from the framework by
.Fn sysmon_pswitch_unregister .
.Pp
The
.Fn sysmon_pswitch_event
is used to signal a new power switch event.
There are two possibilities for the value of
.Fa event :
.Bl -tag -width PSWITCH_HK_VENDOR_BUTTON -offset indent
.It PSWITCH_EVENT_PRESSED
A button has been pressed, the lid has been closed, the AC adapter is off, etc.
.It PSWITCH_EVENT_RELEASED
A button has been released, the lid is open, the AC adapter is on, etc.
.El
.Pp
The corresponding events in
.Xr powerd 8
are
.Em pressed
and
.Em released .
