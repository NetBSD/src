.Sh NAME
.Nm accf_data
.Nd buffer incoming connections until data arrives
.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Cd "pseudo-device accf_data"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This is a filter to be placed on a socket that will be using

to receive incoming connections.

It prevents the application from receiving the connected descriptor via
.Fn accept
until data arrives on the connection.
.Sh EXAMPLES
If the
.Nm
accept filter is present in the kernel configuration,
this will enable the data accept filter
on the socket
.Fa sok .
.Bd -literal -offset 0i
	struct accept_filter_arg afa;

	bzero(&afa, sizeof(afa));
	strcpy(afa.af_name, "dataready");
	setsockopt(sok, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ACCEPTFILTER, &afa, sizeof(afa));
