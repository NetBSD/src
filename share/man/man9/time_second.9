.Dt TIME_SECOND 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm time_second ,
.Nm time_uptime ,
.Nm time_uptime32
.Nd system time variables
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/time.h
.Vt extern const time_t time_second;
.Vt extern const time_t time_uptime;
.Vt extern const uint32_t time_uptime32;
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Va time_second
variable is the system's
.Dq wall clock ,
giving the number of seconds since midnight (0 hour),
January 1, 1970, (proleptic) UTC,
minus the number of leap seconds.
It is set at boot by
.Xr inittodr 9 ,
and is updated periodically via
.Xr timecounter 9
framework, and also updated by the
.Xr settimeofday 2
system call.
.Pp
The
.Va time_uptime
variable is a monotonically increasing system clock.
It is set at boot, and is updated periodically.
(It is not updated by
.Xr settimeofday 2 . )
.Pp
The
.Va time_uptime32
variable is the low-order 32 bits of
.Va time_uptime ,
which is cheaper to read on 32-bit platforms.
.Pp
You must only read the variables
.Va time_second ,
.Va time_uptime ,
and
.Va time_uptime32 ;
you may not write to them or take their addresses.
They may be implemented as macros.
.Pp
The
.Xr bintime 9 ,
.Xr getbintime 9 ,
.Xr microtime 9 ,
.Xr getmicrotime 9 ,
.Xr nanotime 9 ,
and
.Xr getnanotime 9
functions can be used to get the current time more accurately and in an
atomic manner.
.Pp
Similarly, the
.Xr binuptime 9 ,
.Xr getbinuptime 9 ,
.Xr microuptime 9 ,
.Xr getmicrouptime 9 ,
.Xr nanouptime 9 ,
and
.Xr getnanouptime 9
functions can be used to get the time elapsed since boot more accurately
and in an atomic manner.
