.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions provide encryption support for 802.11 device drivers.
.Pp
.\"
The
.Fn ieee80211_crypto_attach
function initializes crypto support for the interface
.Fa ic .
The default is null crypto.
.Pp
.\"
The
.Fn ieee80211_crypto_detach
function frees data structures associated with crypto support
for the interface
.Fa ic .
.Pp
.\"
The two above functions are automatically called by the interface
attach and detach routines, respectively.
.Pp
.\"
The
.Fn ieee80211_crypto_encap
function encapsulates the packet supplied in mbuf
.Fa m0 ,
with the crypto headers given the for node
.Fa ni .
Software encryption is possibly performed.
In case of no specified key for
.Fa ni
or multicast traffic, the default key for the interface
.Fa ic
is used for encapsulation.
The key is returned in the case of successful encapsulation,
otherwise
.Dv NULL
is returned.
