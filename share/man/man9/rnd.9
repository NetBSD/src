.Fn rnd_attach_source "krndsource_t *rnd_source" "char *devname" "uint32_t source_type" "uint32_t flags"
.Ft void

.Ft void
.Fn rnd_add_uint32 "krndsource_t *rnd_source" "uint32_t datum"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These
.Nm
functions make a device available for entropy collection for
the kernel entropy pool, which provides key material for the
.Xr cprng 9
and
.Xr rnd 4
.Pa ( /dev/random )
interfaces.
.Pp
Ideally the first argument
.Fa rnd_source
of these functions gets included in the devices' entity struct,
but any means to permanently (statically) attach one such argument
to one incarnation of the device is ok.
Do not share
.Fa rnd_source
structures between two devices.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 8n
.It Fn rnd_attach_source "krndsource_t *rnd_source" "char *devname" "uint32_t source_type" "uint32_t flags"
This function announces the availability of a device for entropy collection.
It must be called before the source struct pointed to by
.Fa rnd_source
is used in any of the following functions.
.Pp
.Fa devname
is the name of the device.
It is used to print a message (if the kernel is compiled with
``options RND_VERBOSE'') and also for status information printed with
.Xr rndctl 8 .
.Pp
.Fa source_type
is
.Dv RND_TYPE_NET
for network devices,
.Dv RND_TYPE_DISK
for physical disks,
.Dv RND_TYPE_TAPE
for a tape drive,
.Dv RND_TYPE_TTY
for a tty,
.Dv RND_TYPE_RNG
for a random number generator, and
.Dv RND_TYPE_ENV
for an environment sensor.
.Dv RND_TYPE_UNKNOWN
is not to be used as a type.
It is used internally to the rnd system.
.Pp
.Fa flags
are the logical OR of
.Dv RND_FLAG_COLLECT_VALUE
(mix data provided by this source into the pool)
.Dv RND_FLAG_COLLECT_TIME
(mix timestamps from this source into the pool)
.Dv RND_FLAG_ESTIMATE_VALUE
(use a delta estimator to count bits of entropy from this source's data towards
the pool estimate)
.Dv RND_FLAG_ESTIMATE_TIME
(use a delta estimator to count bits of entropy from this source's timestamps
towards the pool estimate).
For many devices,
.Dv RND_FLAG_DEFAULT
(
.Dv RND_FLAG_COLLECT_VALUE
|
.Dv RND_FLAG_COLLECT_TIME
|
.Dv RND_FLAG_ESTIMATE_TIME
) is the best choice.
Note that devices of type
.Dv RND_TYPE_NET
default to
.Dv RND_FLAG_COLLECT_VALUE
|
.Dv RND_FLAG_COLLECT_TIME
(no entropy counted).
.Pp
.It Fn rnd_detach_source "krndsource_t *rnd_source"
This function disconnects the device from entropy collection.
.It Fn rnd_add_uint32 "krndsource_t *rnd_source" "uint32_t datum"
This function adds the value of
.Va datum
to the entropy pool.
No entropy is assumed to be collected from this value, it merely helps
stir the entropy pool.
All entropy is gathered from jitter between the timing of events.
.Pp
Note that using a constant for
.Va datum
does not weaken security, but it does
not help.
Try to use something that can change, such as an interrupt status register
which might have a bit set for receive ready or transmit ready, or other
device status information.
.Pp
To allow the system to gather the timing information accurately, this call
should be placed within the actual hardware interrupt service routine.
Care must be taken to ensure that the interrupt was actually serviced by
the interrupt handler, since on some systems interrupts can be shared.
.Pp
This function loses nearly all usefulness if it is called from a scheduled
software interrupt.
If that is the only way to add the device as an entropy source, don't.
.Pp
If it is desired to mix in the
.Va datum
and to add in a timestamp, but not to actually estimate entropy from a source
of randomness, passing
.Dv NULL
for
.Va rnd_source
is permitted, and the device does not need to be attached.
.It Fn rnd_add_data "krndsource_t *rnd_source" "void *data" "uint32_t len" "uint32_t entropy"
adds (hopefully) random
.Fa data
to the entropy pool.
.Fa len
is the number of bytes in
.Fa data
and
.Fa entropy
is an "entropy quality" measurement.
If every bit of
.Fa data
is known to be random,
.Fa entropy
is the number of bits in
.Fa data .
.Pp
Timing information is also used to add entropy into the system, using
inter-event timings.
.Pp
If it is desired to mix in the
.Va data
and to add in a timestamp, but not to actually estimate entropy from a source
of randomness, passing
.Dv NULL
for
.Va rnd_source
is permitted, and the device does not need to be attached.
.El
.Sh INTERNAL ENTROPY POOL MANAGEMENT
When a hardware event occurs (such as completion of a hard drive
transfer or an interrupt from a network device) a timestamp is
generated.
This timestamp is compared to the previous timestamp
recorded for the device, and the first, second, and third order
differentials are calculated.
.Pp
If any of these differentials is zero, no entropy is assumed to
have been gathered.
If all are non-zero, one bit is assumed.
Next, data is mixed into the entropy pool using an LFSR (linear
feedback shift register).
.Pp
To extract data from the entropy pool, a cryptographically strong hash
function is used.
The output of this hash is mixed back into the pool using the LFSR,
and then folded in half before being returned to the caller.
.Pp
Mixing the actual hash into the pool causes the next extraction to
return a different value, even if no timing events were added to the
pool.
Folding the data in half prevents the caller to derive the
actual hash of the pool, preventing some attacks.
.Pp
In the
.Nx
kernel, values should be extracted from the entropy pool
.Em only
via the
.Xr cprng 9
interface.
Direct access to the entropy pool is unsupported and may be dangerous.
There is no supported API for direct access to the output of the entropy pool.

These functions are declared in src/sys/sys/rnd.h and defined in
src/sys/kern/kern_rndq.c.

.Sh HISTORY
The random device was introduced in
.Nx 1.3 .
.Sh AUTHORS
This implementation was written by Michael Graff \*[Lt]explorer@flame.org\*[Gt]
using ideas and algorithms gathered from many sources, including
the driver written by Ted Ts'o.
.Sh BUGS
The only good sources of randomness are quantum mechanical, and most
computers avidly avoid having true sources of randomness included.
Don't expect to surpass "pretty good".
