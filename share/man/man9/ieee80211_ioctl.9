.Sh DESCRIPTION
These
functions are typically invoked by drivers in response to requests
for information or to change settings from the userland.
.Pp
.\"
The
.Fn ieee80211_cfgget
and
.Fn ieee80211_cfgset
functions implement a legacy interface for getting and setting 802.11
interface attributes respectively.
The interface is compatible with the RIDs implemented by the
.Xr wi 4
driver and used by the
.Xr wiconfig 8
utility.
.Pp
.\"
The
.Fn ieee80211_ioctl
function implements ioctls such as key management for wireless devices.
Ioctls related to the Ethernet layer also pass through here, but are
handed off to
.Fn ether_ioctl
when no match for
.Fa cmd
is found.
