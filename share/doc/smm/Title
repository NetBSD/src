The documentation for 4.4BSD is in a format similar
to the one used for the 4.2BSD and 4.3BSD manuals.
It is divided into three sets; each set consists of one or more volumes.
The abbreviations for the volume names are listed in square brackets;
the abbreviations for the manual sections are listed in parenthesis.

		Games (6)
		Macro packages and language conventions (7)

	System Installation and Administration
.DE
.LP
References to individual documents are given as ``volume:document'',
thus USD:1 refers to the first document in the ``User's Supplementary
Documents''.
References to manual pages are given as ``\fIname\fP(section)'' thus
.IR sh (1)
refers to the shell manual entry in section 1.
.LP
The manual pages give descriptions of the features of the
4.4BSD system, as developed at the University of California at Berkeley.
They do not attempt to provide perspective or tutorial information about the
4.4BSD operating system, its facilities, or its implementation.
Various documents on those topics are contained in the
``\s-1UNIX\s+1 User's Supplementary Documents'' (USD), the
``\s-1UNIX\s+1 Programmer's Supplementary Documents'' (PSD),
and ``\s-1UNIX\s+1 System Manager's Manual'' (SMM).
In particular, for an overview see ``The \s-1UNIX\s+1 Time-Sharing System'' (PSD:1)
by Ritchie and Thompson; for a tutorial see
``\s8\s-1UNIX\s+1\s10 for Beginners'' (USD:1) by Kernighan,
and for an guide to the new features of this latest version, see
``Berkeley Software Architecture Manual (4.4 Edition)'' (PSD:5).
.LP
Within the area it surveys, this volume attempts to be timely, complete
and concise.  Where the latter two objectives conflict,
the obvious is often left unsaid in favor of brevity.
It is intended that each program be described as it is, not as it should be.
Inevitably, this means that various sections will soon be out of date.
.LP
Commands are programs intended to be invoked directly by
the user, in contrast to subroutines, that are
intended to be called by the user's programs.
User commands are described in URM section 1.
Commands generally reside in directory
.I /bin
(for
.IR bin \|ary
programs).
Some programs also reside in
.I
/\|usr/\|bin,
.R
to save space in
.I  /\|bin.
.R
These directories are searched automatically by the command interpreters.
Additional directories that may be of interest include
.I
/\|usr/\|contrib/\|bin,
.R
which has contributed software
.I
/\|usr/\|old/\|bin,
.R
which has old but sometimes still useful software and
.I
/\|usr/\|local/\|bin,
.R
which contains software local to your site.
.LP
Games have been relegated to URM section 6 and
.I
/\|usr/\|games,
.R
to keep them from contaminating
the more staid information of URM section 1.
.LP
Miscellaneous collection of information necessary for
writing in various specialized languages such as character codes, 
macro packages for typesetting, etc is contained in URM section 7.
.LP
System calls are entries into the BSD kernel.
The system call interface is identical to a C language
procedure call; the equivalent C procedures are described in PRM section 2.
.LP
An assortment of subroutines is available;
they are described in PRM section 3.
The primary libraries in which they are kept are described in
.IR intro (3).
The functions are described in terms of C.
.LP
PRM section 4 discusses the characteristics of
each system ``file'' that refers to an I/O device.
The names in this section refer to the HP300 device names for the hardware,
instead of the names of the special files themselves.
.LP
The file formats and conventions (PRM section 5)
documents the structure of particular kinds of files;
for example, the form of the output of the loader and
assembler is given.  Excluded are files used by only one command,
for example the assembler's intermediate files.
.LP
Commands and procedures intended for use primarily by the
system administrator are described in SMM section 8.
The files described here are almost all kept in the directory
.I /\|etc.
The system administration binaries reside in
.I
/\|sbin,
.R
and
.I
/\|usr/\|sbin.
.LP
Each section consists of independent entries of a page or so each.
The name of the entry is in the upper corners of its pages,
together with the section number.
Entries within each section are alphabetized.
The page numbers of each entry start at 1;
it is infeasible to number consecutively the pages of 
a document like this that is republished in many variant forms.
.LP
All entries are based on a common format;
not all subsections always appear.
.RS
.LP
The
.I name
subsection lists the exact names of the commands and subroutines
covered under the entry and gives a short description of their purpose.
.LP
The
.IR synopsis ""
summarizes the use of the program being described.
A few conventions are used, particularly in the Commands subsection:
.LP
.RS
.B Boldface
words are considered literals, and are typed just as they appear.
.LP
Square brackets [ ] around an argument show that the argument is optional.
When an argument is given as ``name'', it always refers to a file name.
.LP
Ellipses ``.\|.\|.'' are used to show that the previous argument-prototype
may be repeated.
.LP
A final convention is used by the commands themselves.
An argument beginning with a minus sign ``\-'' usually means that it is an
option-specifying argument, even if it appears in a position where
a file name could appear.  Therefore, it is unwise to have files whose
names begin with ``\-''.
.LP
.RE
The
.IR description ""
subsection discusses in detail the subject at hand.
.LP
The
.IR files ""
subsection gives the names of files that are built into the program.
.LP
A
.I
see also
.R
subsection gives pointers to related information.
.LP
A
.I  diagnostics
subsection discusses the diagnostic indications that may be produced.
Messages that are intended to be self-explanatory are not listed.
.LP
The
.IR bugs ""
subsection gives known bugs and sometimes deficiencies.
Occasionally the suggested fix is also described.
.LP
.RE
At the beginning of URM, PRM, and SSM is a List of Manual Pages,
organized by section and alphabetically within each section, and a
Permuted Index derived from that List.
Within each index entry, the title of the writeup to which
it refers is followed by the appropriate section number in parentheses.
This fact is important because there is considerable
name duplication among the sections, arising principally from commands that
exist only to exercise a particular system call.
Finally, there is a list of documents on the inside back cover of each volume.
