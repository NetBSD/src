# Sample fstab for multiple ramdisks (mfs and tmpfs).
#

#
# mfs examples
#

# /tmp is on a 5MB mfs partition; see mount_mfs(8) for details.
# Adjust the size according to the amount of free RAM.
swap	/tmp	mfs	rw,-s=5m,nodev,nosuid

#
# tmpfs examples
#

# Standard tmpfs entry for /tmp.
tmpfs	/tmp		tmpfs	rw

# Standard tmpfs entry for /var/run.
#tmpfs	/var/run	tmpfs	rw
# Note that for this to work correctly you must add /var/run to the list
# of critical local file systems in /etc/rc.conf.  You can do so by adding
# the following to that file:
#critical_filesystems_local="${critical_filesystems_local} /var/run"

# Mounts tmpfs over /tmp with a size limit.
#tmpfs	/tmp		tmpfs	rw,-s128M

# Mounts a tmpfs instance to be used by a specific user.
#tmpfs	/home/foo/tmp	tmpfs	rw,-ufoo,-gusers,-s50M

# Shared memory tempfs template allocating 25% of available memory
tmpfs	/var/shm	tmpfs	rw,-m1777,-sram%25
