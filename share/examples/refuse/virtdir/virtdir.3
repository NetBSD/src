.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
provides virtual directory functionality for the benefit of
.Xr refuse 3
file systems (and also for FUSE-based file systems).
.Pp
It uses the framework provided by the
.Xr puffs 3
subsystem, and, through that, the kernel interface provided by
.Xr puffs 4 .
.Pp
The
.Nm
routines build up and manage a list of virtual directory entries.
Each virtual directory entry is indexed by its full pathname within
the file system.
This is consistent with the way that
.Xr refuse 3
locates directory entries - by full pathname.
.Pp
The list of paths is sorted alphabetically.
Each of these virtual directory entries has a distinct type -
file
.Pq Sq f ,
directory
.Pq Sq d ,
or symbolic link
.Pq Sq l .
Additionally, an entry can point to a target - this
is useful when modeling virtual directory entries which are
symbolic links.
The list contains three basic
.Xr stat 2
structures, which contain basic information for file, directory
and symbolic link entries.
This information can be specified at
initialization time, and customized within the individual
getattr operation routines as specified by the
individual file systems.
The
.Nm
functionality can also make virtual directory entries available
on a per-directory basis
to the caller by means of routines analogous to
.Xr opendir 3 ,
.Xr readdir 3 ,
and
.Xr closedir 3 .
These are
.Fn openvirtdir ,
.Fn readvirtdir ,
and
.Fn closevirtdir ,
respectively.

.Sh HISTORY
An unsupported experimental version of
.Nm
first appeared in
.Nx 5.0 .
