This directory contains example programs written in assembly language
for a variety of platforms.  They are intended to illustrate the
specific details of how to write assembly code on a given platform;
they are not supposed to teach assembly (although they might have this
side-effect).

If you want to build one of these example programs, you can "cp -rf"
the corresponding directory anywhere else where you have write
permissions and then issue a "make" within the directory.
