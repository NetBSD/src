When an action file named "exec" is encountered by sushi, it will be read
for a name of a program to execute.  Only the first line of this file is
read, and no continuations are allowed.  Arguments may be passed to the
program by placing them in the exec file.  Additional arguments are passed
to the program from the contents of the form.  These arguments are passed
in the order they appear in the form.

For example, an exec file might contain the following:

pkg_info -v

And it's preceeding form (if any) might contain one field, such as the
name of a package to get detailed information on.  So the actual command
that might get run, could look something like this:

pkg_info -v fooshi-1.3

Note that all fields are passed as arguments, if you want them to be or not.
