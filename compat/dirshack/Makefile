# hacky method to get compat multilib base objdirs created before
# make tries to go create the subdirs used for builds.

# the problem is that make handles objdir creation for subdirs before it
# handles this current directory, so when make cd's into $arch/$libtype
# and from there into the ../../lib dirs, it ends up setting the forced
# MAKEOBJDIR to something based upon ${.CURDIR}, since the objdir
# doesn't exist yet.
# 
# our solution is simple - from this Makefile we traverse the same list
# of $arch/$libtype's with "BOOTSTRAP_SUBDIR=".  then the compat/Makefile
# handles these subdirs as normal, with the base objdir created.
