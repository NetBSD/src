This contains man page groff source for the CVS revision control system.
CVS is a version control system which allows you to keep old versions of
files (usually source code), keep a log of who, when, and why changes
occurred, etc., like RCS  or SCCS. Unlike the simpler systems, CVS does
not just operate on one file at a time or one directory at a time, but
operates on hierarchical collections of directories consisting of version
controlled files. CVS helps to manage releases and to control the
concurrent editing of source files among multiple authors. CVS allows
triggers to enable/log/control various operations and works well over a
wide area network (see man pages).
