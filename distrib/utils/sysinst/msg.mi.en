{NetBSD/@@MACHINE@@ @@VERSION@@

This menu-driven tool is designed to help you install NetBSD to a hard
disk, or upgrade an existing NetBSD system, with a minimum of work. 
In the following menus type the reference letter (a, b, c, ...) to
select an item, or type CTRL+N/CTRL+P to select the next/previous item. 
The arrow keys and Page-up/Page-down may also work. 
Activate the current selection from the menu by typing the enter key.

message thanks
{Thank you for using NetBSD!
}

message installusure
{You have chosen to install NetBSD on your hard disk.  This will change
information on your hard disk.  You should have made a full backup
before this procedure!  This procedure will do the following things:
	a) Partition your disk
	b) Create new BSD file systems
	c) Load and install distribution sets
	d) Some initial system configuration

(After you enter the partition information but before your disk is
changed, you will have the opportunity to quit this procedure.)

Shall we continue?
}

message upgradeusure
{Ok, let's upgrade NetBSD on your hard disk.  As always, this will
change information on your hard disk.  You should have made a full backup
before this procedure!  Do you really want to upgrade NetBSD?
(This is your last warning before this procedure starts modifying your
disks.)
}

message reinstallusure
{Ok, let's unpack the NetBSD distribution sets to a bootable hard disk.
This procedure just fetches and unpacks sets onto an pre-partitioned
bootable disk. It does not label disks, upgrade bootblocks, or save
any existing configuration info.  (Quit and choose `install' or
`upgrade' if you want those options.)  You should have already done an
`install' or `upgrade' before starting this procedure!

Do you really want to reinstall NetBSD distribution sets?
(This is your last warning before this procedure starts modifying your
disks.)

message layout
{NetBSD uses a BSD disklabel to carve up the NetBSD portion of the disk
into multiple BSD partitions.  You must now set up your BSD disklabel.

You can use a simple editor to set the sizes of the NetBSD partitions,
or keep the existing partition sizes and contents.

You will then be given the opportunity to change any of the disklabel
fields.

The NetBSD part of your disk is %d Megabytes.
A full installation requires at least %d Megabytes without X and
at least %d Megabytes if the X sets are included.
}

message Choose_your_size_specifier
{Choosing megabytes will give partition sizes close to your choice,
but aligned to cylinder boundaries.  Choosing sectors will allow you
to more accurately specify the sizes.  On modern ZBR disks, actual
cylinder size varies across the disk and there is little real gain
from cylinder alignment.  On older disks, it is most efficient to
choose partition sizes that are exact multiples of your actual
cylinder size.

Choose your size specifier}

message ptnsizes
{You can now change the sizes for the system partitions.  The default is
to allocate all the space to the root file system, however you may wish

should boot from hard disk.  Follow the instructions in the INSTALL
document about final configuration of your system.  The afterboot(8)

At a minimum, you should edit /etc/rc.conf to match your needs. See

now need to follow the instructions in the INSTALL document as to
what you need to do to get your system reconfigured for your situation.
Remember to (re)read the afterboot(8) manpage as it may contain new
items since your last upgrade.

At a minimum, you must edit rc.conf for your local environment and change
rc_configured=NO to rc_configured=YES or reboots will stop at single-user,
and copy back the password files (taking into account new system accounts
that may have been created for this release) if you were using local
password files.

message unpackcomplete
{Unpacking additional release sets of NetBSD-@@VERSION@@ is now complete.  
You will now need to follow the instructions in the INSTALL document

At a minimum, you must edit rc.conf for your local environment and change
rc_configured=NO to rc_configured=YES or reboots will stop at single-user.
