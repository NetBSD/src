message fullpart
{We are now going to install NetBSD on the disk %s.

NetBSD requires a single partition in the disk's MBR partition table,
this is split further by the NetBSD disklabel.
NetBSD can also access file systems in other MBR partitions.

If you select 'Use the entire disk' then the previous contents of the
disk will be overwritten and a single MBR partition used to cover the
entire disk. 
If you want to install more than one operating system then edit the
MBR partition table and create a partition for NetBSD.

A few hundred MB is enough for a basic installation, but you should allow
extra for additional software and user files. 
Allow at least 5GB if you want to build NetBSD itself.
