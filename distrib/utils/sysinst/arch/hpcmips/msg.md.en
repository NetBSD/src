message md_hello
{If you booted from a floppy, you may now remove the disk.

}

message wdtype
{What kind of disk is %s?}

message sectforward
{Does your disk do AUTOMATIC sector forwarding?}

message dlgeom
{It appears that your disk, %s, has already been labeled with a BSD
disklabel and the disklabel reports geometry that is different from
the real geometry.  The two geometries are:

disklabel:	%d cylinders, %d heads, %d sectors 
real geometry:	%d cylinders, %d heads, %d sectors 
}

/* the %s's will expand into three character strings */
message dobad144
{Installing the bad block table ...
}

message getboottype
{Would you like to install the normal set of bootblocks or serial bootblocks?

Normal bootblocks use the BIOS console device as the console
(usually the monitor and keyboard). Serial bootblocks use the first
serial port as the console.
}

message dobootblks
{Installing boot blocks on %s....
}

message askfsroot1
{I will be asking for partition information.

First the root partition.  You have %d %s left on your disk.
}

message askfsroot2
{Root partition size? }

message askfsswap1
{
Next the swap partition.  You have %d %s left on your disk.
}

message askfsswap2
{Swap partition size? }

message otherparts
{You still have some space remaining unallocated on your disk.  Please
give sizes and mount points for the following partitions.

}

message askfspart1
{The next partition is /dev/%s%c.  You have %d %s left on your disk.
}

message askfspart2
{Partition size? }

message cyl1024
{The disklabel (set of partitions) you specified has a root partition that
ends beyond the 1024 BIOS cylinder boundary. To be sure that the system
can be booted at all times, the entire root partition must lie below that
limit. You can either: }

message onebiosmatch
{This disk matches the following BIOS disk:

{BIOS # cylinders  heads   sectors
------ ---------- ------- -------

message biosmultmatch
{This disk matches the following BIOS disks:

}

message biosmultmatch_header
{   BIOS # cylinders  heads   sectors
   ------ ---------- ------- -------
}

message biosgeom_advise
{
Note: since sysinst was able to uniquely match the disk you chose with a disk
known to the BIOS, the values displayed above are very likely correct, and
should not be changed. Only change them if they are very obviously wrong.
}

message biosmultmatch_row
{%-1d: %-6x %-10d %-7d %d\n}

message pickdisk
{Choose disk: }

message wmbrfail
{Rewrite of MBR failed. I can't continue.}

message partabovechs
{The NetBSD part of the disk lies outside of the range that the BIOS on
your machine can address. Booting from it may not be possible. Are you
sure you that you want to do this?

(Answering 'no' will take you back to the partition edit menu.)}

message installbootsel
{You appear to have more than one operating system installed on your
disk. Do you want to install a bootselector so that you can select
which system to start up when your computer is (re)started?}

message installmbr
{The start of the NetBSD part of the disk lies outside of the range
that the BIOS can address. The initial bootcode in the Master Boot
Record needs to be able to use the extended BIOS interface to boot
off this partition. Do you want to install the NetBSD bootcode into
the Master Boot Record so that this is ensured? Note that this will
overwrite the existing code in the MBR, like some bootselectors.}

message installnormalmbr
{You have chosen not to install a bootselector. If this was because you
already have a bootselector installed, no further action is needed.
However, if no bootselector is installed, the normal bootcode must be
used, or your system will not boot properly. Do you want to use the normal
NetBSD bootcode?}

message configbootsel
{Configure the different bootselection menu items. You can change the
simple menu entries for the matching partition entries that are displayed
when the system boots. Also, you can specify the timeout and default
action to be taken (if no selection is made in the bootmenu).\n

{Boot menu timeout: %d\n}

message emulbackup
{Either the /emul/aout or /emul directory on your system was a symbolic link
pointing to an unmounted file system. It has been given a '.old' extension.
Once you bring your upgraded system back up, you may need to take care
of merging the newly created /emul/aout directory with the old one.
