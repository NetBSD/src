.\" ---------- MD instructions on setting up boot media
.
.(Note
.Nx*M
\*V
does not support any framebuffers other than NWB-253 on NWS-3470D and
XA on NWS-5000 (yet) so
you have to use serial console on installation procedure
if your machine doesn't have supported framebuffers listed above.
.Note)
.Pp
You will need to have
two 1.44 MB floppy disks
to boot off.
You must put the boot floppy image onto this disk, which contains
software to install
.Nx
system.
.Pp
If you are using a
.Ul
system (such as
.Tn NEWS-OS
or other
.Nx
machines) to write the floppy images to disks, you should use the
.Xr dd 1
command to copy the file system image(s)
(.fs file(s)) directly to the raw floppy disk.
.Pp
If you have an i386 machine which runs
.Tn Microsoft Windows
and use it to write the floppy image(s) to floppy disk, you can use the
.Ic Rawrite32
Windows program.
It can be downloaded from
.Lk https://www.NetBSD.org/~martin/rawrite32 .
.Ic rawrite
utility for the
.Tn MS-DOS
environment is also available in the
.Pa i386/installation/misc/
directory of i386 install media.
.Pp
Though
.Nx*M
uses the floppy disk to boot for the initial
installation, the
.Nx*M
kernel does not support the
floppy device.
Some other machines or systems are still required to write floppy images
even after
.Nx*M
has been installed.
.Pp
If your machine doesn't have any SCSI disks, or the SCSI interface
on your machine is not supported, it can still run
.Nx*M
diskless.
No file transfer is needed, and all you have to do is to prepare files on
the server.
More information about diskless setups can be found at
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/docs/network/netboot/
.Pp
On NWS-3xxx machines, the PROM also supports network boot but it uses
an unusual protocol which is not supported by
.Nx*M .
On NWS-5000 machines, the PROM uses the ordinary tftp protocol, so
you can load bootloader via network by
.Ic "bo tftp()"
command on the PROM prompt.
.Pp
The
.Tn NEWS
PROM also supports tape boot, but
.Nx*M
does not support that currently.
.Pp
After the boot floppy is prepared, just type
.Ic "bo fd"
(NWS-5000) or
.Ic "bo fh"
(NWS-3xxx) on the PROM prompt to boot it.
