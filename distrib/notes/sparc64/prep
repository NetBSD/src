If you're installing
.Nx*M
for the first time it's a good idea
to look at the partition sizes of disk you intend installing
.Nx
on.
.Pp
Assuming a classic partition scheme with
.Pa /
(root) and
.Pa /usr
file systems, a comfortable size for the
.Nx
.Pa /
partition is about 64 MB;
a good initial size for the swap partition is twice the amount of physical
memory in your machine (though, unlike
.Tn SunOS
4.x, there are no restrictions
on the size of the swap partition that would render part of your memory
unusable). A full binary installation including X11R6 takes nearly 200 MB in
.Pa /usr .
.Pp
You cannot use the security modes of the SPARC OpenBoot PROM.
.Pp
.Dl ok Ic "setenv security-mode none"
.Pp
Some network devices (i.e. certain SBus cards)
allow a choice between operating on a UTP or a AUI port. The
.Li le
driver supports automatic detection of the port which is actually connected to
the wire.
If automatic detection is not available or not working properly in your
environment, you may have to specify the type connection using the
.Ar media
parameter of
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
During installation, you'll get the
opportunity to specify the appropriate medium. Use
.Li 10base5/AUI
to select the AUI connector, or
.Li 10baseT/UTP
to select the UTP connector.
