.Ss2 Deciding on partition sizes
.
If you're installing
.Nx*M
for the first time it's a good idea
to look at the partition sizes of the disk you plan to install
.Nx
on.  Will you be installing
.Nx
onto the same disk as
.Tn Solaris ,
on its own disk,
or will you be netbooting?  While
.Nx
can work just fine on a disk shared with
.Tn Solaris ,
the
.Nx
installer does not currently support this.  The limitation is that the
.Nx
.Xr disklabel 8
writes partition info that 
.Tn Solaris
is not familiar with.  Therefore, if you are sharing a disk with
.Tn Solaris ,
any time you change a partition table, you must do it from
.Tn Solaris .
.Pp
Assuming a classic partition scheme with
.Pa /
(root) and
.Pa /usr
file systems, a comfortable size for the
.Nx
.Pa /
partition is about 200 MB.
A full binary installation including X takes over 600 MB in
.Pa /usr .
Since the pkgsrc binaries are typically installed in
.Pa /usr/pkg 
you may want a significantly larger 
.Pa /usr
partition.
A good initial size for the swap partition is the amount of physical
memory in your machine if you've got more than 128 MB RAM.  If you've got 
less RAM, you may want swap to be at least 128 MB.
.Pp
Note that the OBP on Ultra 1 and Ultra 2 machines can only boot from the first
4Gb of the disk, so this limits the size of the root partition on these models.
.
.Ss2 Setting up Open Firmware
.
First, you need to stop your system from automatically booting when
powered on. Pressing the
.Key STOP
key (sometimes called the
.Key L1
key, found on the left side of your keyboard) and the
.Key a
key will halt your system and give you the 
.Dq Li ok
prompt. If you are using a serial console, send a
.Dq BREAK
signal from your terminal (the method of sending
.Dq BREAK
varies from terminal to terminal).
.Pp
If the ethernet address of your \*M system is
.Li ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
(check with the Open Firmware
.Dq banner
command),
then your NVRAM battery is dead and you will have trouble using
ethernet (among other problems).  Read the Sun NVRAM/Hostid FAQ.
.Lk http://www.squirrel.com/squirrel/sun-nvram-hostid.faq.html
.Pp
If you have a valid ethernet address and you plan to netboot, write down
your system's ethernet address.
.Pp
You cannot use the security modes of the SPARC OpenFirmware.
.(disp
.No ok Ic "setenv security-mode none"
.disp)
.Pp
If you are using a serial console, the
.Nx*M
installer defaults to using 9600 bps, 8N1 settings.  You may want to 
configure your system and serial terminal like this prior to booting the 
installer.  A new installation of
.Nx*M
will default to these settings as well.
.Pp
SCSI devices are specified by an Open Firmware
.Ic devalias
which provides simple mnemonics for the full path to the device. Type
.Ic devalias
to get a list of all of the available aliases.
At a minimum, the alias and partition are necessary when booting.
.Pp
Therefore, to boot from the swap partition on the internal hard drive
one would use:
.Pp
.(disp
.No ok Ic "boot disk:b"
.disp)
.Pp
To boot from a CD-ROM (Open Firmware assumes SCSI CD-ROMs are at target 6),
one would use:
.Pp
.(disp
.No ok Ic "boot cdrom"
.disp)
.Pp
And to boot from a kernel named
.Li netbsd-GENERIC
on the fourth partition (
.Sq Li d ,
often the
.Pa /usr
partition) on an external SCSI hard drive (target 2, partition 3), one 
would use:
.Pp
.(disp
.No ok Ic "boot disk2:d netbsd-GENERIC"
.disp)
.Pp
If you get
.Dq .... Fast Data MMU Miss
when booting after the NetBSD installation, your OpenBoot PROM may
need updating. It has been reported that version 3.31 lead to a
successful boot on an Ultra Enterprise 420R, while version 3.23 did
not. Exact values may vary, depending on your hardware, current
OpenBoot PROM version and moon phase.
.Pp
.
.Ss2 Determining how to boot from an SBUS or PCI card
.
Some SBUS and PCI cards have firmware that lets you use them as boot 
devices.  These cards do not automatically create
.Ic devalias
entries, so you must traverse the device tree to figure out what
Open Firmware calls your card.  You will be using Open Firmware commands
at the 
.Sq Li ok
prompt. First `cd' to the top of the device tree and list the
nodes there.  The following is the procedure to boot from an IDE card in 
an UltraSPARC 30.
.(disp
.No ok Ic "cd /"
.No ok Ic "ls"
f006cf08 SUNW,ffb@1e,0
f006c32c SUNW,UltraSPARC-II@0,0
f006002c counter-timer@1f,1c00
f005f410 pci@1f,2000
f005eb54 pci@1f,4000
f004cf84 virtual-memory
f004c9a4 memory@0,0
f002ce38 aliases
f002cdc8 options
f002cc90 openprom
f002cc24 chosen
f002cbb4 packages
.disp)
Usually, you can simply type in the name before the at (@) sign and
OpenFirmware will fill in the rest.
.(disp
.No ok Ic "cd pci@1f,4000"
.No ok Ic "ls"
f0081524 ide@2
f007be50 scsi@3
f0074688 network@1,1
f0060324 ebus@1
.No ok Ic "cd ide@2"
.No ok Ic "ls"
0081fe4 cdrom
f0081938 disk
.No ok Ic "cd disk"
.No ok Ic "ls"
.No ok Ic "pwd"
/pci@1f,4000/ide@2/disk
.disp)
OK, now we know the path to the IDE device in this example.  Now, we need
to determine if it's capable of booting.  If it is, it will have the
.Ic word
`open'.
.(disp
.No ok Ic "words"
close         load          write         read          seek
open          write-blocks  read-blocks   max-transfer
block-size    dma-free      dma-alloc     spin-down     spin-up
.disp)
Great!
Also, in case you're interested in further details about your
hardware, you can use the 
.Ic .properties
command.
.Pp
So, when it's time to type in a boot command, use the shortened version of 
the
.Ic pwd
command.  You need to be more specific if there are two devices with the 
same name (in this case, two /pci entries).  In this example, you'd type:
.(disp
.No ok Ic "boot /pci@1f,4000/ide/disk@0,0"
.disp)
You can also store this device path across reboots using the
.Ic nvalias
command.
.(disp
.No ok Ic "nvalias wd0 /pci@1f,4000/ide/disk@0,0:a"
.disp)
.Pp
And when the kernel is done booting, it may not automatically use your
card as the root device -- you may need to type in the
.Nx*M
name for
that device:
.(disp
root on sd0a dumps on sd0b
no file system for sd0 (dev 0x700)
cannot mount root, error = 79
.No "root device (default sd0a):" Ic "?"
use one of: hme0 sd0[a-h] wd0[a-h] halt
.No "root device (default sd0a):" Ic "wd0a"
.No "dump device:" Ic "wd0a"
.No "file system (default generic):" Ic "ffs"
root on wd0a
.disp)
.Pp
The root device can also be specified in your kernel config file.
.
.Ss2 Configuration of network interfaces
.
Some network devices (i.e., certain SBus cards)
allow a choice between operating on a UTP or a AUI port.
The
.Li le
driver supports automatic detection of the port which is actually connected to
the wire.
If automatic detection is not available or not working properly in your
environment, you may have to specify the type connection using the
.Ar media
parameter of
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
During installation, you'll get the
opportunity to specify the appropriate medium.
Use
.Li 10base5/AUI
to select the AUI connector, or
.Li 10baseT/UTP
to select the UTP connector.
