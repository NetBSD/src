The minimal configuration requires 32 MB of RAM and ~60 MB of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended, as
.Nx
with 32 MB of RAM feels like
.Tn Solaris
with 32 MB of RAM - slow.
Note that until you have at least 64 MB of RAM, getting more RAM is more
important than getting a faster CPU.
.Pp
Not all of the machines listed here have been tested.  Often Sun will use 
the same motherboard design in multiple models.  For example, they'll 
release a Blade ("workstation") model, Enterprise or Fire ("server") 
model, and Netra or ft ("telco") model with essentially the same devices, 
as far as
.Nx
is concerned.  If one model in this scheme works, it is highly likely 
another will work.  
.Pp
Sun has also released a few models with names that 
might imply the systems are UltraSPARC-based but actually have an
i386 class CPU.  These systems might be supported by the i386 port of
.Nx .
See the following site for more info on what system boards are in which 
models.
