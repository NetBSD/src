PCI-based UltraSPARC systems (known to work on the Ultra 5, Ultra 10, Ultra 30,
Ultra 60, Ultra 80 and their rack mounted equivalents E220R, E250, E420 and E450,
as well as Blade 100, Netra T1, Netra X1 - and may work on many other systems)

The minimal configuration requires 32 MB of RAM and ~60 MB of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended, as
.Nx
with 32 MB of RAM feels like
.Tn Solaris
with 32 MB of RAM - slow.
Note that until you have at least 64 MB of RAM, getting more RAM is more
important than getting a faster CPU.
