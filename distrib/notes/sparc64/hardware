.Ss2 Supported machines
The minimal configuration requires 32 MB of RAM and ~180 MB of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.
Note that until you have at least 64 MB of RAM, getting more RAM is more
important than getting a faster CPU.
.Pp
Not all of the machines listed here have been tested.
Often Sun used the same motherboard design in multiple models.
For example, there might be a Blade ("workstation") model, Enterprise
or Fire ("server") model, and Netra or ft ("telco") model with essentially
the same devices, as far as
.Nx
is concerned.
If one model in this scheme works, it is highly likely another will work.  
.Pp
Sun has also released a few models with names that 
might imply the systems are UltraSPARC-based but actually have an
i386/amd64 class CPU.
These systems might be supported by the i386 or amd64 ports of
.Nx .
