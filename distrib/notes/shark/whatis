This is the first major release of
.Nx*M .
Previous versions of
.Nx
supported the Shark platform as part of
.Nx /arm32 .

Unlike previous release of
.Nx
for the ARM architecture, the \*M port uses the ELF binary
format.
However,
.Nx \*V
on \*M is, as usual, also fully backward compatible with old
.Nx
a.out ARM binaries, so you don't need to recompile all your local
programs provided you set the appropriate binary compatibility options
in your kernel configuration.
