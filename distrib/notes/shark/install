The steps taken for installing
.Nx*M
are different for diskless and hard disk configurations.
.Ss2 Installation for diskless configurations
This sections assumes you know how to configure DHCP, TFTP,
and NFS services on your server.
.Pp
.(enum
Place the kernel into the TFTP server's download area.  If the
kernel has a
.Dq .gz
suffix, you must first uncompress it using the
.Pa gunzip
program.
.Pp
.Dl server# Ic cp netbsd-GENERIC /tftpboot/netbsd-shark
.Pp
Note that your DHCP server must be configured to specify
this file as the boot file for the client.
.It
Unpack the distribution sets into the client's root directory
on the server.
.Pp
.Dl server# Ic cd /export/client/shark
.Dl server# Ic gzcat .../base.tgz | tar xvpf -
.Dl server# Ic gzcat .../etc.tgz | tar xvpf -
.Dl [ repeat for all sets you wish to unpack ]
.It
Load the kernel from the TFTP server.
.Pp
.Dl ok Ic boot net
.enum)
.Pp
The installation of your diskless
.Nx*M
system is now complete!  You may now skip ahead to any post-installation
instructions.
.
.Ss2 Installation onto a hard disk
To install or upgrade
.Nx*M
on a hard disk, you need to first boot the installation
program and then interact with the screen-menu program
.Ic sysinst .
The installation program actually consists of the
.Nx
kernel plus an in-memory file system of utility programs.
.Pp
If you have an existing
.Nx
installation on your hard disk,
you may copy the special installation kernel into your existing
root file system.
.Pp
.Dl client# Ic gzcat .../shark/installation/instkernel/netbsd.gz > /netbsd.inst
.Pp
You may then boot the installation kernel.
.Pp
.Dl ok Ic boot disk netbsd.inst
.Pp
If you do not have an existing
.Nx
installation, then you must load the installation kernel over the
network.  You must configure a DHCP and TFTP server in order to do this.
.Pp
Place the installation kernel into the TFTP server's download area.
.Pp
.Dl server# Ic gzcat .../shark/installation/instkernel/netbsd.gz > /tftpboot/shark-inst
.Pp 
Note that your DHCP server must be configured to specify
this file as the boot file for the client.
.Pp
You may then boot the installation kernel.
.Pp
.Dl ok Ic boot net
.Pp
Once the installation kernel has loaded, the
.Ic sysinst
installation program should launch automatically.
