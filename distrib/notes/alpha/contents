.Ss2 NetBSD/\*m Subdirectory Structure
The \*m-specific portion of the
.Nx \*V
release is found in the
.Pa \*m
subdirectory of the distribution:
.ie \n[_FOR_RELEASE] .Pa \&.../NetBSD-\*V/\*m/

.\"============================================ ALPHA INSTALLATION SUBTREE
.
.Bl -tag -compact -width diskimage/
.		It Pa floppy/
\*m boot and installation floppies; see below.
.		It Pa diskimage/
.		It Pa tapeimage/
.No \&an image file Pa cdhdtape
is included for the case where the installer is written to
a CD, hard drive, or tape.
This image file is the same for the CD, HD, and tape cases,
.No but a separate Pa tapeimage/
directory exists to hold a copy of the
.Tn README No file and to meet the
.Nx
.Xr release 7
standard.
.		It Pa instkernel/
.No contains a Pa netbsd.gz
installation kernel; this is the same installer kernel as in all the
other install
images, but without the various boot program and filesystem wrappers.
It can be netbooted or diskbooted from a previous installation. Note: there is
no need to ungzip this image.

.		It Pa misc/
contains
.Pa GENERIC.fs ,
.No a Tn GENERIC
kernel in a bootable filesystem image. This is used in some unusual
installations as described in the next section.

.Ss2 Bootable installation/upgrade floppies:
.Pp
There are three bootable images in the
.Nx
\*m distribution.
One is for a dual-floppy boot and is split into two separate files.
The other is a single-file image containing the same install kernel,
but intended to be written to a CD, tape, or hard drive. The third
image is a
.Tn GENERIC
kernel intended for production use in unusual cases.
This can be useful at some sites when:
.Bl -bullet
.It
You want to run diskless but SRM bugs prevent the firmware from
netbooting. You can work around this problem by always booting the generic
kernel from the floppy.
.It
SRM doesn't recognize your (hard) disk controller but
.Nx
does. This
happens more frequently than you might think. SRM will usually only boot
from
.Xr ncr 4
or
.Xr isp 4
SCSI devices, and on most platforms will not
boot from an IDE drive.
.Nx
will happily operate
with almost any SCSI root or an IDE root; the solution here is to netboot
a kernel or always boot from floppy.
.El
.

.Ss2 Binary Distribution Sets
The
.Nx
\*m
binary distribution sets contain the binaries which
comprise the
.Nx \*V
release for the \*m. There are eight binary distribution
.ie r_pc532 sets.
.el .No sets and the Em security No distribution set.
The binary distribution sets can be found in the
.Pa \*m/binary/sets
subdirectory
of the
.Nx \*V
distribution tree, and are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width mmmmmmmmmmm -compact
.Pp
.It Sy base
The

.No \*m Sy base No binary distribution. You
.Em must
install this distribution set. It contains the base

utilities that are necessary for the
system to run and be minimally functional. It
includes shared library support, and excludes
everything described below.

.\"============================ MI DISCUSSION OF BINARY SETS
.
.Pp
The \*m binary distribution sets are distributed as gzipped tar files
named with the extension
.Sy .tgz , No e.g.
.Pa base.tgz .
.
.
.\" contrary to most old INSTALL docs, only i386 has Split/ sets
.
.
.Pp
The instructions given for extracting the source sets work equally
well for the binary sets, but it is worth noting that if you use that
method, the files are /-relative and
therefore are extracted
.Em below
the current directory. That
is, if you want to extract the binaries into your system, i.e.
replace the system binaries with them, you have to run the
.Ic tar xfp
command from /.
