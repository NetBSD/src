There have been many, many Alpha-specific enchancements since the
1.2 release. These include:

    * Supporting more system types (including the 8200/8400).

    * Making many more device drivers (mostly from the i386 port)
    work on the alpha.

    * Changing the object file format from COFF to ELF, and adding
    shared library support

NetBSD 1.3 on alpha is, as usual, also fully backward compatible
with old NetBSD/alpha binaries, so you don't need to recompile all
your local programs.
