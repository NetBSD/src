NetBSD/x68k \*V runs on the Sharp X68030 series PCs with a
.Em true
MC68030 MPU (not the original MC68EC030).  Since the processor of
the X68030 series is the MC68EC030, you need to replace it with an
MC68030. Simply remove the old chip and put in the new one instead.
The largest difficulty might be to open your X68030.
.Pp
In addition, some accelerators are supported:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact -offset indent
.It
Xellent30 series
.It
040turbo
.It
Jupiter-X (040 / 060)
.It
060turbo
.El
.Pp
This means all models of X680x0 series PC except for CZ-600C
and CZ-674C, by using the appropriate accelerator, can run NetBSD!!
Note that the processor for the Xellent30 series is MC68EC030, so
you need to replace your processor as well as for X68030.
.Pp
For 68030 systems, installing MC68881 or MC68882 FPCP is highly recommended
but not required.
.Pp
The minimal configuration requires 4M of RAM and about 100M of
disk space.  To install the entire system requires much more disk space,
and to run X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.
.Pp
Here is a table of recommended HD partition sizes for a full install:
.Bl -column -offset indent local\ (/local) Advised With\ X Needed With\ X
.It Partition   Ta Advised      Ta With\ X      Ta Needed       Ta With\ X
.It root\ (/)   Ta 25M  Ta 25M  Ta 20M  Ta 20M
.It user\ (/usr)        Ta 150M  Ta 200M Ta 100M  Ta 125M
.It swap                Ta 2*RAM...
.It local\ (/local)     Ta up\ to\ you...
.El
.Pp
As you may note the recommended size of /usr is 70M greater than
needed. This is to leave room for a kernel source and compile tree
as you will probably want to compile your own kernel. (ALL is
large and bulky to accommodate all people).
.Pp
Supported devices include:
.Bl -bullet -compact -offset indent
.Pp
.It
Sharp genuine SCSI interface (builtin / optional)
* SCSI harddisks, CD-ROM drives, tape drives, scanners,...
.It
Mankai Seisakusho Mach-2 SCSI interface
.It
The builtin floppy drives
.It
The builtin frame buffer (both of the text and graphics screen)
.It
The builtin serial (RS-232C)
.It
The builtin parallel (Centronics printer interface)
.It
The standard keyboard
.It
The mouse / trackball
.It
NS16550 serial
.It
Neptune-X ethernet
.El
.Pp
Hopefully, the AD-PCM sound device will be supported on the future releases.
