Installation is supported from several media types, including:
.(bullet
Tape
.It
NFS
.It
CD-ROM
.It
FTP
.bullet)
.Pp
Note that installing on a
.Sq bare
machine requires either a bootable
tape drive or an ethernet to a compatible NFS server.
MVME147 may also need to be booted over an RS232 connection.
.Pp
The procedure for transferring the distribution sets onto installation
media depends on the type of media.
Instructions for each type of media are given below.
.Pp
In order to create installation media, you will need all the files and
subdirectories in these two directories:
.Pp
.(item -offset indent
.Pa \&.../NetBSD-\*V/\*M/installation
.It
.Pa \&.../NetBSD-\*V/\*M/binary
.item)
.
.Ss2 Creating boot/install tapes
.
Installing from tape is the simplest method of all.
This method uses two tapes, one containing a bootable ramdisk and miniroot,
the other containing the installation sets.
.Pp
The boot tape is created as follows:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "cd .../NetBSD-\*V/\*M/installation"
.Dl # Ic "set T = /dev/nrst0"
.Dl # Ic "mt -f $T rewind"
.Dl # Ic "dd if=tapeimage/stboot of=$T obs=8k conv=osync"
.Dl # Ic "dd if=tapeimage/bootst of=$T obs=8k conv=osync"
.Dl # Ic "gzip -dc tapeimage/netbsd-RAMDISK.gz | dd of=$T obs=8k conv=osync"
.Dl # Ic "gzip -dc miniroot/miniroot.fs.gz  | dd of=$T obs=8k conv=osync"
.Dl # Ic "mt -f $T rewind"
.Pp
The installation set tape is created as follows:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "cd .../NetBSD-\*V/\*M/binary/sets"
.Dl # Ic "set T = /dev/nrst0"
.Dl # Ic "mt -f $T rewind"
.Dl # Ic "for f in base etc comp games man misc rescue text; do"
.Dl   Ic "\ \ \ \ gzip -d \*[Lt] $f.\*[setsuffix] | dd of=$T bs=8k conv=osync"
.Dl # Ic "done"
.Dl # Ic "mt -f $T rewind"
.Pp
If the tape does not work as expected, you may need to explicitly
set the EOF mark at the end of each tape segment.
Consult the tape-related manual pages on the system where the tapes
are created for more details.
.
.Ss2 Boot/Install from NFS server
.
If your machine has a disk and network connection, but no tape drive,
it may be convenient for you to install
.Nx
over the network.
This involves temporarily booting your machine over NFS, just long enough
so you can initialize its disk.
This method requires that you have access to an NFS server on your
network so you can configure it to support diskless boot for your machine.
Configuring the NFS server is normally a task for a system administrator,
and is not trivial.
.Pp
If you are using a
.Nx
system as the boot-server, have a look at
the
.Xr diskless 8
manual page for guidelines on how to proceed with this.
If the server runs another operating system, consult the
documentation that came with it (i.e.
.Xr add_client 8
on
.Tn SunOS ) .
.Pp
Booting an MVME147 from ethernet is not possible without first downloading
a small bootstrap program (sboot) via RS232.
See the section entitled
.Sx "Installing from NFS"
for details on how to accomplish this.
.Pp
sboot expects to be able to download a second stage bootstrap
program via TFTP after having acquired its IP address through RARP
It will look for a filename derived from the machine's IP address
expressed in hexadecimal, with an extension of
.Sq Pa .147 .
For example, an MVME147 with IP address 130.115.144.11 will make an TFTP
request for
.Pa 8273900B.147 .
Normally, this file is just a symbolic link to the
.Nx*M
.Pa netboot
program, which should be located in a place
where the TFTP daemon can find it (remember, many TFTP daemons run in
a chroot'ed environment).
The netboot program may be found in the install directory of this distribution.
.Pp
The
.Tn MVME162
,
.Tn MVME167
,
.Tn MVME172
,
and
.Tn MVME177
boot ROMs have code builtin to boot over ethernet from a TFTP server.
You should configure it to download the same
.Pa netboot
program as is used for
.Tn MVME147 .
.Pp
The netboot program will query a bootparamd server to find the NFS
server address and path name for its root, and then load a kernel from
that location.
The server should have a copy of the netbsd-RAMDISK kernel in
the root area for your client (no other files are needed in the client
root, although it might be a convenient place to put the uncompressed
miniroot image) and
.Pa /etc/bootparams
on the server should have an entry for your client and its root directory.
Note that you should rename the
.Pa netbsd-RAMDISK
kernel to just
.Pa netbsd
in the client's root directory before trying to netboot the client.
.Pp
The client will need access to the miniroot image, which can be
provided using NFS or remote shell.
If using NFS, miniroot.fs.gz should be expanded on the server,
because doing so from the RAMDISK shell is not so easy.
The unzipped miniroot takes about 7.5 MB of space.
.Pp
If you will be installing
.Nx
on several clients, it may be useful
to know that you can use a single NFS root for all the clients as long
as they only use the netbsd-RAMDISK kernel.
There will be no conflict between clients because the RAM-disk kernel
will not use the NFS root.
No swap file is needed; the RAM-disk kernel does not use that either.
.
.Ss2 Install/Upgrade from CD-ROM
.
This method requires that you boot from another device
(i.e. tape or network, as described above).
You may need to make a boot tape on another machine using the files
provided on the CD-ROM.
Once you have booted netbsd-RAMDISK (the RAMDISK kernel) and loaded the
miniroot, you can load any of the distribution sets directly from the CD-ROM.
The
.Ic install
program in the miniroot automates the
work required to mount the CD-ROM and extract the files.
.
.Ss2 Install/Upgrade via FTP
.
This method requires that you boot from another device
(i.e., tape or network, as described above).
You may need to make a boot tape on another machine using the files
in .../install (which you get via FTP).
Once you have booted netbsd-RAMDISK (the RAM-disk kernel) and loaded the
miniroot, you can load any of the distribution sets over the net using FTP.
The
.Ic install
program in the miniroot
automates the work required to configure the network interface and
transfer the files.
.Pp
This method, of course, requires network access to an FTP server.
This might be a local system, or it might be ftp.NetBSD.org itself.
If you wish to use ftp.NetBSD.org as your FTP file
server, you may want to keep the following information handy:
.Pp
.(disp
No IP Address: ftp.NetBSD.org
Login: anonymous
Password: \*[Lt]your e-mail address\*[Gt]
Server path: /pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-\*V/\*M/binary
.disp)
