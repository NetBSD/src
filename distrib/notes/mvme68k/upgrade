It is possible to easily upgrade your existing NetBSD/mvme68k system
using the upgrade program in the miniroot. If you wish to upgrade
your system by this method, simply select the `upgrade' option once
the miniroot has booted. The upgrade program with then guide you
through the procedure. The upgrade program will:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Enable the network based on your system's current
network configuration.
.It
Mount your existing filesystems.
.It
Extract binary sets from the media of your choice.
.It
Fixup your system's existing /etc/fstab, and if necessary,
changing the occurrences of `ufs' to `ffs' and let you
edit the resulting file.
.It
Make new device nodes in your root filesystem.
.It
Copy a new kernel onto your root partition.
NOTE: the existing kernel WILL NOT be backed up; doing
so would be pointless, since older kernels may not be
capable of running
.Nx \*V
executables.
.It
Install a new boot block.
.It
Check your filesystems for integrity.
.El
.Pp
While using the miniroot's upgrade program is the preferred method
of upgrading your system, it is possible to upgrade your system
manually. To do this, follow the following procedure:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Place _at least_ the `base' binary set in a filesystem
accessible to the target machine. A local filesystem
is preferred, since the NFS subsystem in the
.Nx \*V
kernel may be incompatible with your old binaries.
.It
Back up your pre-existing kernel and copy the _VER
kernel into your root partition.
.It
Reboot with the _VER kernel into single-user mode.
.It
Check all filesystems:
.Pp
.Dl Ic /sbin/fsck -pf
.It
Mount all local filesystems:
.Pp
.Dl Ic /sbin/mount -a -t nonfs
.It
If you keep /usr or /usr/share on an NFS server, you
will want to mount those filesystems as well. To do
this, you will need to enable the network:
.Pp
.Dl Ic sh /etc/netstart
.It
Run the
.Xr update 8
daemon, to ensure that new programs are actually stored on disk.
.Pp
.Dl Ic update
.It
Make sure you are in the root filesystem and extract
the `base' binary set:
.Pp
.Dl Ic cd /
.Dl Ic pax\ -zrvpe\ -f Ar /path/to/ Ns Ic base.tgz
.Pp
.It
Delete system files in /sbin which now live in /usr/sbin:
.Pp
.Dl Ic cd /sbin
.Dl Ic rm -f mountd rtquery quotacheck dumpfs dumplfs
.It
Install a new boot block (you may need to be running in
single-user mode to do this...):
.Pp
.Dl Ic cd /usr/mdec
.Dl Ic cp bootsd /.bootsd
.Dl Ic ./installboot /.bootsd bootxx \*< Ar root-disk
.Pp
.Pq Ar root-disk No might be, e.g., Ic /dev/rsd0a
.It
Sync the filesystems:
.Pp
.Dl Ic sync
.It
At this point you may extract any other binary sets
you may have placed on local filesystems, or you may
wish to extract additional sets at a later time.
To extract these sets, use the following commands:
.Pp
.Dl Ic cd /
.Dl Ic pax -zrvpe -f Ar path_to_set
.El
.Pp
.(Note
You
.Em SHOULD NOT
extract the
.Sy etc
set if upgrading. Instead, you should extract that set into
another area and carefully merge the changes by hand.
.Note)
