Installing
.Nx
is a relatively complex process, but if you have
this document in hand it should not be too difficult.
.Pp
There are several ways to install
.Nx
onto your disk. If your
machine has a tape drive the easiest way is "Installing from tape"
(details below). If your machine is on a network with a suitable
NFS server, then "Installing from NFS" is the next best method.
Otherwise, if you have another VME147 machine running
.Nx
you can
initialize the disk on that machine and then move the disk.
.
.Ss2 Installing from tape:
.
Create the NetBSD/mvme68k _VER boot tape as described in the section
entitled "Preparing a boot tape". Then, with the tape in the drive,
type the following at the 147Bug prompt:
.Pp
.Dl 147-Bug\*> Ic bo 5
.Pp
As mentioned earlier, this assumes your tape is jumpered for SCSI-id 5.
.Pp
As the tape loads (which may take 20 to 30 seconds), you will see a
series of status messages. It may be useful if you can capture these
messages to a file, or a scrollable xterm window. In particular, you
should make a note of the lines which describe the geometry of the
SCSI disks detected by NetBSD. They are of the form:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
sd0 at scsibus0 targ 0 lun 0: \*<CDC, 94161-9, 2506\*> SCSI1 0/direct fixed
sd0: 148MB, 967 cyl, 9 head, 35 sec, 512 bytes/sect x 304605 sectors
.Ed
.Pp
The information of most interest is the number of sectors; here it's
304605. You will need this number when you come to create a disklabel
for that drive.
.Bd -literal -offset indent

Finally, you will see the following "welcome" message:
.Bd -literal offset indent
        Welcome to the NetBSD/mvme68k RAMDISK root!

This environment is designed to do only four things:
  1:  Partititon your disk (use the command:  edlabel /dev/rsd0c)
  2:  Copy a miniroot image into the swap partition  (/dev/rsd0b)
  3:  Make that partition bootable (using 'installboot')
  4:  Reboot (using the swap partition, i.e. /dev/sd0b).

Copying the miniroot can be done several ways, allowing the source
of the miniroot image to be on any of these:
    boot tape,  NFS server, TFTP server, rsh server

The easiest is loading from tape, which is done as follows:
        mt -f /dev/nrst0 rewind
        mt -f /dev/nrst0 fsf 3
        dd bs=8k if=/dev/nrst0 of=/dev/rsd0b
(For help with other methods, please see the install notes.)

To reboot using the swap partition after running installboot, first
use "halt", then at the Bug monitor prompt use a command like:
        bo 0,,b:

To view this message again, type:  cat /.welcome

.Ed
.Pp
You must now create a disklabel on the disk you wish to use for the
root filesystem. This will usually be
.Li sd0 .
The disklabel is used by
NetBSD to identify the starting block and size of each partition on
the disk.
.Pp
Partitions are named
.Li sd0a, sd0b, sd0c
.No etc, up to Li sd0h .
The \*m port of
.Nx
makes some assumptions about the first three partitions on a boot disk:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width sd0c
.It Li sd0a
The root filesystem.
.It Li sd0b
The swap partition.
.It Li sd0c
The whole disk. Also known as the
.Em raw partition .
.El
.Pp
The
.Em raw partition No is special;
.Nx
is able to use it even if the
disk has no label. You should never create a filesystem on the Raw
Partition, even on a non-boot disk.
.Pp
It is good practice to put
.Pa /usr No on a different partition
than / (sd0a). So, the first available partition for
.Pa /usr No is Li sd0d .
Refer to the section entitled
.Sx NetBSD System Requirements and Supported Devices
for information on the recommended sizes of the /,
.Pa /usr No and Pa swap
partitions.
.Pp
You are not required to define any partitions beyond
.Li sd0d , No but if you
have a large disk drive, you might want to create several other partitions
for filesystems such as
.Pa /home
.No or Pa /usr/src.
Note that at this time you
are only required to partition the root/boot disk; you will get the
opportunity to partition any other disks in your system from the main
.Ic miniroot
installation program.
.Pp
To create the disklabel and partitions, use the
.Li edlabel No  program,
passing it the name of the Raw Partition of your root/boot disk.
.Pp
.Dl ssh: Ic edlabel /dev/rsd0c
.Dl edlabel menu:
.Dl print   - display the current disk label
.Dl modify  - prompt for changes to the label
.Dl write   - write the new label to disk
.Dl quit    - terminate program
.Dl edlabel\*>
.Pp
The program shows what commands it recognizes;
.Em print , modify , write
.No and Em quit .
It will accept the first letter of a command if
you don't feel like typing each one in full.
.Pp
To start creating the basic partitions, you should enter
.Ic m No (modify)
at the edlabel prompt, then enter the letter corresponding to the first
.No partition, Sy a .
.Dl edlabel\*> Ic m
.Pp
.Dl modify subcommands:
.Dl @   : modify disk parameters
.Dl a-h : modify partition
.Dl s   : standarize geometry
.Dl q   : quit this subcommand
.Dl edlabel/modify\*> Ic a
.Dl a (root)          0       (0/00/00)          0       (0/00/00)  unused
.Dl start as \*<blkno\*> or \*<cyls/trks/sects\*> : Ic 0
.Dl length as \*<nblks\*> or \*<cyls/trks/sects\*> : Ic 38000
.Dl type: Ic 4.2BSD
.Dl edlabel/modify\*>
.Pp
When you enter the start and length of a partition, you can use either
blocks or cylinder/track/sector notation. If this is the first time
you've partitioned a disk for NetBSD, it's probably easiest to use block
notation. The above example creates partition 'a', starting at block zero
and with a size of 38000 blocks. Note that the usual size of a block is
512 bytes, so this creates a 19Mb partition.
.Pp
The 'type' of the partition should be "4.2BSD", otherwise you won't
be able to create a filesystem on it.
.Pp
Next, create a swap partition (b). Note that the minimum size of this
swap partition should be 8Mb, otherwise you won't be able to use a
miniroot to complete the
.Nx
installation!
.Pp
.Dl edlabel/modify\*> Ic b
.Dl b (swap)          0       (0/00/00)          0       (0/00/00)  unused
.Dl start as \*<blkno\*> or \*<cyls/trks/sects\*> : Ic 38000
.Dl length as \*<nblks\*> or \*<cyls/trks/sects\*> : Ic 32768
.Dl type: Ic swap
.Dl edlabel/modify\*>
.Pp
Here, we specify a value for 'start' such that the swap partition follows
immediately after partition 'a', i.e. 38000. The length of the swap
partition should be a multiple of the amount of RAM you have in your
system. Here, I've chosen 32768, or 16Mb. The next available block on the
drive is thus 38000 + 32768. We will use this to create partition 'd' for
our /usr filesystem. (Note that for a busy system, or a system with more
than 8Mb of RAM, you'll be better off with a 32 or 64Mb swap partition.)
.Pp
.Dl edlabel/modify\*> Ic d
.Dl d (user)          0       (0/00/00)          0       (0/00/00)  unused
.Dl start as \*<blkno\*> or \*<cyls/trks/sects\*> : Ic 70768
.Dl length as \*<nblks\*> or \*<cyls/trks/sects\*> : Ic 233837
.Dl type: Ic 4.2BSD
.Dl edlabel/modify\*> Ic q
.Dl edlabel\*>
.Pp
As you can see, I've chosen to assign the remainder of the disk to
.Pa /usr .
Since there are 304605 sectors on the example disk (did you remember to
note down the number of sectors on your disk during boot?), and partition
.Sy d
starts at sector 70768, a simple bit of arithmetic (304605 - 70768)
gives
.Sy d No a size of 233837.
.Pp
You now need to write this new disklabel, together with the partition
details you've just entered, to disk. You might also try the 'p' command
to view the partitions. Once written, you can quit back to ssh using 'q'.

.Dl ssh:
.Pp
Now that your disk's partitioned, you need to get the proper installation
miniroot image onto it. The miniroot image is designed to be copied into
the swap partition of your disk. This is a safe place which won't be
overwritten by the installation procedure. From the ssh prompt, use the
following commands to copy the miniroot image from tape to swap (b).
.Pp
.Dl ssh: Ic mt -f /dev/nrst0 rewind
.Dl ssh: Ic mt -f /dev/nrst0 fsf 3
.Dl ssh: Ic dd bs=8k if=/dev/nrst0 of=/dev/rsd0b
.Pp
The disk and the miniroot must now be made bootable using the
.Xr installboot 8
command. To do this, issue the following commands:
.Pp
.Dl ssh: Ic mount /dev/sd0b /mnt
.Dl ssh: Ic installboot /mnt/usr/mdec/bootsd /bootxx /dev/rsd0b
.Dl ssh: Ic umount /dev/sd0b
.Pp
You can now shutdown the system.
.Pp
.Dl ssh: Ic halt
.Dl signal 15
.Dl ssh: syncing disks... done
.Dl unmounting /mnt (/dev/sd1b)...
.Dl unmounting / (root_device)...
.Dl halted

.Dl Automatic reset of known SCSI Buses on RESET [Y,N] Y?
.Dl Cold/Warm Reset flag [C,W] = C?
.Dl Execute Soft Reset [Y,N] N? Ic y
.Pp
You should now reboot from that just installed miniroot. See the section
entitled "Booting the miniroot" for details.
.
.Ss2 Installing from NFS:
.
Before you can install from NFS, you must have already configured
your NFS server to support your machine as a bootable client.
Instructions for configuring the server are found in the section
entitled "Getting the NetBSD System onto Useful Media" above.
.Pp
To get started, you need to download "sboot" into RAM (you will find
.Ic sboot
in the 
.Pa install
directory of the mvme68k distribution).
You can either do that through the console line or through a 2nd serial
connection. For example, a VME147 connected to a sun4/110 and accessed via
.Xr tip 1
can be loaded as follows:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
lo 0
~Ccat sboot
go 4000
.Ed
.Pp
Which will look like this:
.Pp
.Dl 147-Bug\*> Ic lo 0
.Dl ~CLocal command? Ic cat sboot
.Pp
.Em away for 11 seconds
.Dl !
.Pp
.Dl 147-Bug\*> Ic g 4000
.Dl Effective address: 00004000
.Pp
.Dl sboot:\ serial\ line\ bootstrap\ program\ (\*&end\ =\ 6018)
.Pp
.Dl \*>\*>\*>
.Pp
Now, if you want to do it through serial line 1, then connect serial
line one to a machine. At the
.Li 147-Bug\*> No prompt type Ic \&tm 1
You should then login to the machine it is connected to.
Then hit "^A" to escape to Bug. do 
.Ic lo 1;x=cat sboot Em ...
then when that is done you can reconnect
.Ic tm 1 No and logout.
.No Then do Ic go 4000
and you've got the "\*>\*>\*> " prompt of sboot.
.Pp
Once you've got the "\*>\*>\*> " prompt, you can boot the RAMDISK kernel
from the server:
.Pp
.Dl \*>\*>\*> b
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent

.Ed
.Pp
After the boot program loads the RAMDISK kernel, you should see the
welcome screen as shown in the "tape boot" section above.
.Pp
You now need to create a disklabel with partition information on the
SCSI disk on which you intend to create your root filesystem. Follow
the instructions in the previous section entitled "Installing from
tape" to do this. (But stop short of the part which describes how to
copy the miniroot from tape.)
.Pp
You must now configure the network interface before you can access the
NFS server containing the miniroot image. For example the command:
.Pp
.Dl ssh: Ic ifconfig\ le0\ inet\ 192.168.1.4 up
.Pp
will bring up the network interface 'le0' with that address. The next
step is to copy the miniroot from your server. This can be done using
either NFS or remote shell. (In the examples that follow, the server has
IP address 192.168.1.1) You may then need to add a default route if the
server is on a different subnet:
.Pp
.Dl ssh: Ic route add default 192.168.1.2 1
.Pp
You can look at the route table using:
.Pp
.Dl ssh: Ic route show
.Pp
Now mount the NFS filesystem containing the miniroot image:
.Pp
.Dl ssh: Ic mount -r 192.168.1.1:/export/soapy /mnt
.Pp
The procedure is simpler if you have space for an expanded (not
compressed) copy of the miniroot image. In that case:
.Pp
.Dl ssh: Ic dd bs=8k if=/mnt/miniroot of=/dev/rsd0b
.Pp
Otherwise, you will need to use "zcat" to expand the miniroot image
while copying. This is tricky because the "ssh" program (small shell)
does not handle sh(1) pipeline syntax. Instead, you first run the reader
in the background with its input set to /dev/pipe and then run the other
program in the foreground with its output to /dev/pipe. The result looks
like this:
.Pp
.Dl ssh: Ic run -bg dd obs=8k if=/dev/pipe of=/dev/rsd0b
.Dl ssh: Ic run -o /dev/pipe zcat /mnt/install/miniroot.gz
.Pp
To load the miniroot using rsh to the server, you would use a pair
of commands similar to the above. Here is another example:
.Pp
.Dl ssh: Ic run -b dd obs=8k if=/dev/pipe of=/dev/rsd0b
.Dl ssh: Ic run -o /dev/pipe rsh 192.168.1.1 zcat miniroot.gz
.Pp
You must now make the disk bootable. Refer to the previous section on
installing from tape, where it describes how to run 'installboot'.
This is immediately following the part which explains how to copy the
miniroot from tape.
.
.Ss2 Booting the miniroot:
.
Assuming the miniroot is installed on partition 'b' of the disk with
SCSI-id 0, then the 147Bug boot command is:
.Dl 147-Bug\*> Ic bo 0,,b:
.Pp
The command line parameters above are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxx
.It Ic 0
controller (usually zero)
.It Ic ,,
bug argument separators
.It Ic \&b:\&
tell the bootstrap code to boot from partition
.Ic b
.El
.Pp
You should see a bunch of boot messages, followed by messages from
the miniroot kernel just as you did when the RAMDISK kernel booted.
.Pp
You will then be prompted to enter the root device. Since the miniroot
was booted from the swap partition, you should enter 'sd0b'. You will
then be asked for the swap device and filesystem type. Just press
return twice to accept the defaults. When asked to enter a terminal
type, either accept the default, or use whatever the TERM environment
variable is set to in the shell of your host system:
.Pp
.DL vmel0 at vmechip0
.DL boot device: sd0
.DL root device (default sd0a): Ic sd0b
.DL dump device (default sd0b):  Em (return)
.DL file system (default generic): Em (return)
.DL root on sd0b dumps on sd0b
.DL mountroot: trying ffs...
.DL root file system type: ffs
.DL init: copying out path `/sbin/init' 11
.DL erase ^H, werase ^W, kill ^U, intr ^C
.DL Terminal type? [vt100] Em return
.Pp
Congratulations! The system should now be running the miniroot
installation program.
.
.Ss Miniroot install program:
.
The miniroot's install program is very simple to use. It will guide
you through the entire process, and is well automated. Additional
improvements are planned for future releases.
.Pp
The miniroot's install program will:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Allow you to place disklabels on additional disks.
The disk we are installing on should already have
been partitioned using the RAMDISK kernel.
.Pp
Note that partition sizes and offsets are expressed
in sectors. When you fill out the disklabel, you will
need to specify partition types and filesystem parameters.
If you're unsure what the these values should be, use the
following defaults:
.Pp
.Dl fstype: 4.2BSD
.Dl fsize: 1024
.Dl bsize: 4096
.Dl cpg: 16
.Pp
If the partition will be a swap partition, use the following:
.Pp
.Dl fstype: swap
.Dl fsize: 0 (or blank)
.Dl bsize: 0 (or blank)
.Dl cpg: 0 (or blank)
.Pp
Note that partition 'c' is special; it covers then entire
disk and should not be assigned to a filesystem.
.Pp
The number of partitions is currently fixed at 8.
.It
Create filesystems on target partitions.
.It
Allow you to set up your system's network configuration.
Remember to specify host names without the domain name
appended to the end.  For example use `foo' instead of
`foo.bar.org'.  If, during the process of configuring
the network interfaces, you make a mistake, you will
be able to re-configure that interface by simply selecting
it for configuration again.
.It
Mount target filesystems. You will be given the opportunity
to manually edit the resulting /etc/fstab.
.It
Extract binary sets from the media of your choice.
.It
Copy configuration information gathered during the
installation process to your root filesystem.
.It
Make device nodes in your root filesystem.
.It
Copy a new kernel onto your root partition.
.It
Install a new boot block.
.It
Check your filesystems for integrity.
.El
.Pp
First-time installation on a system through a method other than the
installation program is possible, but strongly discouraged.
