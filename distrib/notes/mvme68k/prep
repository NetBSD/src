\*M machines usually need little or no preparation before installing
.Nx ,
other than the usual, well advised precaution of
.Em backing up all data
on any attached storage devices.
.Pp
The exception to the above is that
.Tn MVME162
,
.Tn MVME167
,
.Tn MVME172
and
.Tn MVME177
boards require a jumper to be removed or DIP switch changed before
.Nx
can be installed.
On
.Tn MVME162-LX
and
.Tn MVME172-LX
pins 1-2 of jumper J11
.Em must
be removed.
On
.Tn MVME162-P2/P4
and
.Tn MVME172-P2/P4
switch S4, position 8
.Em must
be set to OFF.
On
.Tn MVME167
and
.Tn MVME177
pins 1-2 of jumper J1
.Em must
be removed.
.Pp
Once you've made any necessary jumper changes,
the following instructions should make your machine
.Dq NetBSD Ready .
.Pp
Power-up your MVME147 board.
You should have the
.Em bug No prompt:
.(disp
COLD Start

Onboard  RAM start = $00000000,  stop = $007FFFFF

147-Bug\*[Gt]
.disp)
.Pp
Or, if you have an MVME162/172 or MVME167/177 board (the following boot
message is from MVME167; the others are similar):
.(disp
MVME167 Debugger/Diagnostics Release Version 2.3 - 02/25/94
COLD Start

Local Memory Found =02000000 (&33554432)

MPU Clock Speed =33Mhz

167-Bug\*[Gt]
.disp)
.Pp
Make sure the RAM size looks ok (if you've got an 8 MB
.Tn MVME147
or a 32 MB
.Tn MVME167
you should have the same value as we do).
Also make sure the clock is ticking:
.Pp
.Dl 1xx-Bug\*[Gt] Ns Ic time
.Dl Sunday   12/21/31   16:25:14
.Dl 1xx-Bug\*[Gt] Ns Ic time
.Dl Sunday   12/21/31   16:25:15
.Dl 1xx-Bug\*[Gt]
.Pp
Note that
.Nx
bases its year at 1968, and adds the year offset in
the system's real-time clock to get the current year.
So the
.Li 31
here
equates to 1999.
You may have to adjust your clock using the
.Ic set
command to comply with
.Nx "" 's
requirements.
Don't worry if the
.Sq Day of the week
is not correct, as
.Nx
doesn't use it.
Motorola has acknowledged a year 2000 bug in some versions of the MVME147
whereby the day of the week
doesn't get set correctly by the 147Bug PROM.
.Em It does not affect
.Nx "" !
.Pp
Also make sure that your board's ethernet address is initialised to
the correct value.
You'll find the address on a label on the inside of
the MVME147's front panel, and on the VMEbus P2 connector of the other
board types.
On the
.Tn MVME147 ,
enter the last five digits of the address
using the
.Ic lsad
command.
On the MVME162/172 and MVME167/177, you should use the
.Ic cnfg
command.
.Pp
The
.Nx
kernel reads the first two long words of the onboard NVRAM to
determine the starting and ending address of any VMEbus RAM that should be
used by the system.
You should verify that this area is set properly for your configuration.
.Pp
If you have no VMEbus RAM boards, the values should be set to zero (0).
.Pp
For an
.Tn MVME162 ,
.Tn MVME167 ,
.Tn MVME172
or
.Tn MVME177
board, at the 1xx-Bug\*[Gt] prompt:
.Pp
.Dl 1xx-Bug\*[Gt] Ns Ic mm fffc0000 ;l
.Dl fffc0000: xxxxxxxx? Ns Ic 0
.Dl fffc0004: xxxxxxxx? Ns Ic 0
.Dl fffc0008: xxxxxxxx? Ns Ic .
.Dl 1xx-Bug\*[Gt]
.Pp
For an
.Tn MVME147
board, at the 147Bug prompt:
.Pp
.Dl 147Bug\*[Gt] Ns Ic mm fffe0764 ;l
.Dl fffe0764: xxxxxxxx? Ns Ic 0
.Dl fffe0768: xxxxxxxx? Ns Ic 0
.Dl fffe076c: xxxxxxxx? Ns Ic .
.Pp
If you do have VMEbus RAM available and want
.Nx
to use it, the first
long word should be set to the starting address of this RAM and the
second long word should be set to the ending address.
.Pp
If you have more than one VMEbus RAM board installed, the starting and
ending addresses must be contiguous from one board to the next.
Also note that, for various reasons beyond the scope of this document,
VMEbus RAM should be configured in A32 address space.
.Pp
To install successfully to a local SCSI disk, you need to ensure that
the system is aware of what targets are connected to the SCSI bus.
This can be done by issuing the following command:
.Pp
.Dl 1xx-Bug\*[Gt] Ic iot;t
.Pp
At this point, Bug will scan for any attached SCSI devices.
After a short delay, a list of SCSI devices will be displayed.
147Bug will ask if LUNs should be assigned from SCSI ids, to which you should
answer Y.
You should also answer Y when asked if the information is
to be saved to NVRAM.
16xBug does not prompt for this information.
.Pp
The following installation instructions will assume that your target
SCSI disk drive appears at SCSI-ID 0.
If you have a tape drive, the instructions assume is configured
for SCSI-ID 5.
When the RAMDISK root boots,
.Nx
will refer to these devices as
.Li sd0
and
.Li rst0
respectively.
You may wish to note these down; you'll be using them a lot. :-)
