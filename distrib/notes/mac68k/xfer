Installation is currently only supported from the local Macintosh hard
drive or from an AppleShare volume (however, you may upgrade a system from
within NetBSD; see the section on upgrading for more details).  This means
that you'll need at least enough room for the largest file that you will
have to install.  This is the 8.6MB base.tgz file.  There has been talk of
allowing an install from split files.  If you have the time, desire, and
knowledge, please feel free to add that functionality.

If the install is being done from an AppleShare-mounted volume, the install
utility must be in the same folder as the data files.

Each distribution file is in "raw" archive format, and must be downloaded
in binary mode.  Common web browsers are not suitable for this task; FTP
clients such as Fetch and Anarchie work fine, but be sure to specify a
binary file transfer.

Also note:  the distribution files should not be unpacked.  If you have
the Internet Config extension installed, 

You will also need to collect the MacOS installation tools from the
"mac68k/installation/misc" subdirectory of the NetBSD _VER distribution:
Mkfs, NetBSD/Mac68k Installer, and NetBSD/Mac68k Booter.  These three are
in binhexed, self-extracting archives as Mkfs.sea.hqx, Installer.sea.hqx,
and Booter.sea.hqx, respectively.  Extract them as you would any other
Macintosh application.
