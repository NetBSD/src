No matter which installation method you use, there is some planning
and preparation that is required beforehand.  First and foremost,
before beginning the installation process, make sure you have a
reliable backup of any data on your hard disk that you wish to keep.
.Em "Mistakes in partitioning your hard disk may lead to data loss."
.Pp 
.Nx*M
uses the same disk mapping scheme as Mac OS: the Apple Disk Partition Map.
This permits both systems to reside on the same disk, but introduces some
installation problems unique to the Macintosh. There are very few, if any,
reliable ways to reduce the size of an existing Mac OS disk partition, so
partitioning a disk that currently contains Mac OS will almost always
require a backup and reload step under Mac OS.
.Pp
If you are using the
.Ic sysinst
method of installation you will be able to
do most, if not all, of your disk partitioning during the install
process.  Partitioning the disk with
.Ic sysinst
will destroy any partition
that is resized, deleted, converted, or designated for use by NetBSD.
All space not planned to be used for Mac OS HFS partitions may be used
by NetBSD and can be sub-divided by the
.Ic sysinst
process.  This space
may be defined within one or more existing disk partitions of any type,
including HFS partitions that are no longer needed for Mac OS. However
it is best if this space is physically contiguous on the disk as
.Ic sysinst
is not capable of merging non-contiguous disk partitions.  If you are
using the
.Ic sysinst
method  and have sufficient disk space in one or more
disk partitions you should skip forward to the section labeled
.Sx Installing\ the\ NetBSD\ System\ (Sysinst\ Method)
in this document.

.Ss NetBSD/mac68k sysinst Bug Alert
.
Because of a problem that could not be fixed in time for this release, the
.Nx*M
.Ic sysinst
installer neither creates file-systems on the configured partitions,
nor mounts them on the configured mountpoints, though it claims to.
Instead,
.Ic sysinst
attempts to install on the ramdisk and fails.
.Pp
Until this is fixed, you can either fall back to the Traditional Method
of installation described below, or you can use the following workaround:
.Pp
While editing the partition table in
.Ic sysinst ,
note on a sheet of paper the partitions with the related mount points
and disk devices. Since you have to do some manual work here, you probably
want to keep the partition structure simple. Continue with the installation,
and in the
.Pp
.
.Dl "Ok, we are now ready to install NetBSD on your hard disk (sd0)."
.Dl "Nothing has been written yet.  This is your last chance to"
.Dl "quit this process before anything gets changed."
.Dl ""
.Dl "Shall we continue?"
.
.Pp
dialog, send
.Ic sysinst
to the background by pressing ctrl-Z. In the following, adjust "sd" (SCSI) or
"wd" (IDE) drive type, drive number (0, 1, ...) and partition letters 
("a" for the root filesystem, "d", "e", etc.) as appropriate for
your setup. A concatenation of this with "/dev/r" will give you
the device name for the partition, e.g. 
.Pa /dev/rsd0a
for the root partition of your first SCSI disk.
.Pp
At the shell prompt, manually create filesystems in the desired
partitions like
.Pp
.Dl # newfs /dev/rsd0a
.Pp
etc. for all the partitions you noted down.
Mount the root partition to
.Pa /targetroot ,
e.g.
.Pp
.Dl # mount /dev/sd0a /targetroot
.Pp
Then, if you have set up other partitions, create directories below
.Pa /targetroot
as mount points
and mount the partitions there according to your notes like e.g.
.Pp
.Dl # mount /dev/sd0e /targetroot/var
.Pp
You can list the mounted partitions with
.Xr df 1
and 
.Xr mount 8
commands, unmounting a wrongly mounted filesystem can be done e.g. with
.Dq umount /targetroot/var .
.Pp
When all the partitions that you want to install to have been properly
set up, you can return to
.Ic sysinst
with the 'fg' command and proceed with the installation.
.
.Pp
.
.Ss Preparation for the Traditional Method
.
If you are using the Traditional method of installation you must use a
disk partitioning utility to designate the different partitions you
will want in your final
.Nx
configuration.  It is not necessary to create
.Nx
(or AU/X) type partitions at this stage; the Mkfs utility
can convert a partition of any type to one usable for
.Nx .
.Pp
If disk partitioning is required because you've selected the Traditional
method of installation, or because disk space needs to be freed up for
use for the
.Ic sysinst
method of installation, follow the directions in the remainder of this section.
.Pp
Find your favorite disk partitioning utility. Any formatter capable of
partitioning a SCSI disk should work. Some of the ones that have been
tried and seem to work are:
.Pp
.(bullet -compact -offset indent
Apple HD SC Setup
.It
Hard Disk ToolKit from FWB
.It
SCSI Director Lite
.It
Disk Manager Mac from OnTrack
.It
Silverlining from LaCie
.It
APS Disk Tools
.bullet)
.Pp
Apple's HD SC Setup is probably the easiest to use and the most commonly
available. Instructions for patching HD SC Setup so that it will recognize
non-Apple drives is available at:
.Pp
.Lk http://www.euronet.nl/users/ernstoud/patch.html
.Pp
First, you need to choose a drive on which to install
.Nx .
Try to pick a
drive with a low SCSI target number (or "SCSI ID"), especially if you are
likely to add or
remove drives to your SCSI chain in the future.
.(Note
Be certain you have a reliable backup of any data that you may want to keep.
Repartitioning your hard drive is an excellent way to destroy important data.
.Note)
.Pp
Second, decide how you want to set up your partitions. At minimum, you
need a partition to hold the
.Nx
installation (the root partition \(em 
.Pa / )
and a
partition to serve as swap space. You may choose to use more than one partition
to hold the installation. This allows you to separate the more vital
portions of the file system (such as the kernel and the
.Pa /etc
directory) from the more volatile parts of the file system.
Typical setups place the
.Pa /usr
directory on a separate partition from the root partition
.Pq Pa / .
Generally,
.Pa /
can be fairly small while the
.Pa /usr
partition should be fairly large.
If you plan to use this machine as a server, you may also want a separate
.Pa /var
partition.
.Pp
Once you have decided how to lay out your partitions, you need to calculate
how much space to allocate to each partition. A minimal install of
.Nx
(i.e.
.Pa base.tgz , etc.tgz, No and either
.Pa kern-GENERIC.tgz No or
.Pa kern-GENERICSBC.tgz )
should just fit in a 56 MB partition.
For a full installation, you should allocate at least 180 MB (150 MB if you
do not wish to install the X sets). A general rule of thumb for sizing
the swap partition is to allocate twice as much swap space as you have
real memory. Having your swap + real memory total at least 20 MB is also
a good idea. Systems that will be heavily used or that are low on real
memory should have more swap space allocated. Systems that will be only
lightly used or have a very large amount of real memory can get away
with less.
.Pp
Keep in mind that
.Nx
currently requires
.Tn Mac OS
in order to boot, so it is likely that you will
want to keep at least a minimal install of
.Tn Mac OS
around on an HFS
partition for this purpose.  The size of this partition may vary depending
on the size requirements for the version of
.Tn Mac OS
you are using.  Of
course, if you have
.Tn Mac OS
on another hard drive or can boot from a floppy,
feel free to dedicate the entire drive to
.Nx .
.Pp
Next, use your favorite partitioning utility to make partitions of the
necessary sizes. You can use any type of partition, but partitions of type
.Li "Apple_Free"
might save you some confusion in the future.
.Pp
You are now set to install
.Nx
on your hard drive.
