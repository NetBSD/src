.Nx \*V
is the fifth
.Dq real
release of
.Nx
for the 68k-based Macintosh.
.Pp
For the mac68k port,
.Nx \*V
brings a number of improvements:
.(bullet
A number of kernel changes enable support for several previously
unsupported systems (such as the LC and Performa 470-series,
570/580-series, and 630-series Macs).
.It
Support for 800 KB floppy drives has been added (i.e. machines that
include the IWM or SWIM, but not the SWIM II or SWIM III)
.It
IBM-compatible MBR handling has been integrated to enable MS-DOS
partition support
.It
The
.Xr mac68k/adb 4
driver has undergone a major revamp.
.It
A number of bugs affecting II-series systems have been fixed.
.bullet)
There is still a lot of work to be done and help is welcomed. Please jump in!
.Nx \*V
on mac68k is, as usual, also fully backward compatible with old
.Nx
mac68k binaries, so you don't need to recompile all of your local programs.
