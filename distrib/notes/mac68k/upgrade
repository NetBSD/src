<<<<<<< upgrade
The upgrade to NetBSD _VER is a binary upgrade; it would be prohibitive
to make users upgrade by compiling and installing the _VER sources, and
it would be very difficult to even compile a set of instructions that
allowed them to do so.  Because of the many changes to the system, it
is difficult and impractical to upgrade by recompiling from the sources
and installing.

There is no upgrade program for upgrading to release _VER for the
NetBSD/mac68k architecture.  The current procedure is basically to perform
a new install from scratch.  It is hoped that there will be a good upgrade
procedure for future releases.  Please feel free to volunteer to help
replace these installation tools.

The following steps outline the current upgrade procedure.  These steps
should help ease the upgrade process.  Please read these instructions
carefully and completely before proceeding:

1) Since upgrading involves replacing the kernel and most of the system
   binaries, it has the potential to cause data loss.  You are strongly
   advised to BACK UP ANY IMPORTANT DATA ON YOUR DISK, whether on the
   NetBSD partition or on another operating system's partition, before
   beginning the upgrade process.  Although the upgrade should not
   damage your filesystem(s) in any way, you never know what may happen.

2) Download the distribution sets you want from the "mac68k/binary/sets"
   subdirectory of the NetBSD _VER distribution.  You will need the base
   set and the kernel at a minimum.  Be sure to download the files in
   _binary_ mode.  If you will be upgrading from within NetBSD, make sure
   that you place the distribution sets on a filesystem you will be able to
   reach from single-user mode.

3) Install the _VER kernel.  You may either use the Installer utility
   (included in the "installation/misc" subdirectory) or install from
   within NetBSD (the latter is recommended for speed reasons).  If you
   choose the former, proceed as you normally would.  If you choose to
   install from within NetBSD, then boot (or shutdown) into single-user
   mode and do the following:

     cd /
     tar -zxvpf /path/to/kern.tgz

   There is no need to explicitly backup your old kernel since it will be
   incapable of running many of the newer binaries you are about to
   install (unless, of course, you have a backup copy of your older
   binaries and want to revert to them for some reason).

4) If you are installing using the Installer, skip to step 5.  Otherwise,
   reboot into NetBSD in single-user mode.  Run 'fsck -f' and then mount all
   local partitions read/write.  Usually 'mount -a -t nonfs' should do the
   trick, but if you have several partitions on the same disk, take note of
   the fact that a change in partition numbering may have moved a few of
   your partitions around.  You can do a 'disklabel sdX' (where X is a
   drive on which you have NetBSD partitions) to see how the partitions are
   currently layed out.  It is likely that a partition has shifted into
   'sdXe', a slot that was often not available under previous releases of
   NetBSD.  If this is the case, you will need to manually mount your root
   partition  (via 'mount -w /') and edit your /etc/fstab file to reflect
   the new partition layout.  Unless you are familiar with 'ex' or 'ed',
   the easiest way to fix your /etc/fstab file is probably to simply do a
   'cat > /etc/fstab' and type in the corrected file in its entirety. 

5) Install the distribution sets.  Keep in mind that the NetBSD _VER
   distribution takes up a considerably larger amount of disk space than
   did the 1.2 or 1.2.1 distributions.  If you are using the Installer,
   proceed normally (remember that you will need to mount non-root
   partitions by hand using the MiniShell before installing).  If you are
   installing from within NetBSD, do the following:

     cd /
     tar --unlink -zxvpf /path/to/base.tgz

   It is crucial that you use the '--unlink' flag when invoking tar or you
   will fail to correctly overwrite some files.  Keep in mind that there is
   no going back once you have installed the base set short of a complete
   re-install of an earlier distribution.  Continue with the appropriate
   command line for each of the other sets you wish to install except for
   the etc set.  If you are in the Installer, open up the Minishell and do
   the following:

     cd /tmp
     exit

   Now, use the Installer to install the etc set (it will install into
   /tmp instead of the /etc/ directory).

   If you are in NetBSD, do the following instead:

     cd /tmp
     tar --unlink -zxvpf /path/to/etc.tgz

6) If you are in the Installer, quit it and boot into NetBSD in single-user
   mode.  From there, 'cd' to the /tmp/etc directory and compare each file
   there with your old files in /etc.  You will probably want to replace
   some of your system configuration files, or incorporate some of the
   changes in the new versions into yours.  You should take note of the
   following when upgrading to the NetBSD _VER etc.tgz set:

   * The first file to pay attention to is /etc/rc.conf.  This file did not
   exist under NetBSD 1.2, but it is used to configure the rc scripts
   under NetBSD _VER.  Edit the file to your preferences, making sure
   that you change the line that says:

     rc_configured=NO

   to read:

     rc_configured=YES

   This will enable all of the options you have configured in /etc/rc.conf.

   * The next important item to take note of is the new networking
   configuration files.  If you currently have an /etc/hostname.xxN file
   (fill in the xx with either ae or sn and the X with a number), you will
   need to convert it into an ifconfig.xxN file before networking
   automatically works.  The format for the new file is simply the
   arguments which you would give to ifconfig on the command line.  The
   following is an example of the minimal ifconfig.xxN file:

     inet hostname.domain.dom netmask 0xffffff00

   Read the ifconfig(8) man page for more details on arguments to ifconfig.
   Be sure to set

     auto_ifconfig=YES

   in /etc/rc.conf to ensure that your network interfaces will be brought
   up automatically on boot.

   * Many of the options given to many of the file systems have changed,
   and some of the file systems have changed names.  IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT
   YOU CHANGE ANY INSTANCES OF "ufs" IN /etc/fstab TO "ffs".  To find out
   more about different filesystem options, read the man page for the
   associated mount command (e.g. mount_mfs(8) for MFS filesystems, note:
   FFS type filesystems are documented in the mount(8) man page).  If you
   have not already done so, you may also need to correct /etc/fstab for
   a shift in the partition numbering scheme.  See step (4) above for more
   details.

   * You will also probably want to upgrade your device nodes at this time
   as well.  Make sure you have installed the latest MAKEDEV script (it
   should be included in the etc set) and perform the following commands:

     cd /dev
     sh MAKEDEV all


7) A number of binaries have changed their locations from NetBSD 1.2.1 to
   NetBSD _VER (most of these have moved from /sbin to /usr/sbin).  A few
   binaries have been removed.  It is probably best if you scan the
   modification dates of the files in the /sbin directory.  If there are
   files in the directory which have newer counterparts in the /usr/sbin
   directory, it is a very good idea to remove the older files (you will
   probably run into difficulties later if you choose not to do this). 
   You should also check the /sbin, /bin, /usr/bin/, and /usr/sbin
   directories for old binaries that are no longer part of the NetBSD
   distribution and delete them as well.  In general, all the files in a
   particular distribution should have similar modification dates, so
   looking at these is a good way of determining a file's age.

8) Run 'fsck -f' to make sure that your filesystem is still consistent.  If
   fsck reports any errors, fix them by answering 'y' to its suggested
   solutions (note: if there are a large number of errors, you may wish
   to stop and run 'fsck -fy' to automatically answer "yes" instead).

9) Exit from single-user mode and it should continue to boot into
   multi-user mode.

At this point you have successfully upgraded to NetBSD _VER.
