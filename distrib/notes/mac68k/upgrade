The upgrade to
.Nx \*V
is a binary upgrade; it can be quite difficult
to advance to a later version by recompiling from source due primarily
to interdependencies in the various components.
.Pp
No automated upgrade procedure exists for upgrading to release \*V for the
NetBSD/mac68k architecture. The current procedure is essentially to perform
a new install from scratch. It is hoped that there will be a good upgrade
procedure for future releases. Please feel free to volunteer to help
replace these installation tools.
.Pp
The following steps outline the current upgrade procedure. These steps
should help ease the upgrade process. Please read these instructions
carefully and completely before proceeding.
.Bl -enum
.It
Since upgrading involves replacing the kernel and most of the system
binaries, it has the potential to cause data loss. You are strongly
advised to
.Em back up any important data on your disk,
whether on the
.Nx
partition or on another operating system's partition, before
beginning the upgrade process. Although the upgrade should not
damage your filesystem(s) in any way, you never know what may happen.
.It
Download the distribution sets you want from the
.Pa mac68k/binary/sets
subdirectory of the
.Nx \*V
distribution. You will need the base
set and the kernel at a minimum. Be sure to download the files in
.Em binary
mode. If you will be upgrading from within NetBSD, make sure
that you place the distribution sets on a filesystem you will be able to
reach from single-user mode.
.It
Install the \*V kernel. You may either use the Installer utility
(included in the 
.Pa installation/misc
subdirectory) or install from within
.Nx
(the latter is recommended for speed reasons). If you
choose the former, proceed as you normally would. If you choose to
install from within NetBSD, then boot (or shutdown) into single-user
mode and do the following:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd /
tar -zxvpf /path/to/kern.tgz
.Ed
There is no need to backup your old kernel explicitly since it will be
incapable of running many of the newer binaries you are about to
install. (Unless, of course, you have a backup copy of your older
binaries and want to revert to them for some reason.) However, you
might want to keep a backup if you are upgrading from within
.Nx
just in case the newer kernel has trouble booting your machine. 
.It
If you are installing using the Installer, skip to step 5. Otherwise,
reboot into
.Nx
in single-user mode. Run
.Ic fsck Fl f
and then mount all
local partitions read/write. Usually
.Ic mount Fl a t Ic nonfs
should do the
trick, but if you have several partitions on the same disk, take note of
the fact that a change in partition numbering may have moved a few of
your partitions around. You can do a
.Ic disklabel sd Ns Ar X
(where
.Ar X
is a
drive on which you have
.Nx
partitions) to see how the partitions are
currently layed out. It is likely that a partition has shifted into the
.Cm sd Ns Ar X Ns Cm d
or
.Cm sd Ns Ar X Ns Cm e
slots, slots that often were not available under
previous releases of NetBSD. If this is the case, you will need to
manually mount your root partition 
.Pq via Sy mount Fl w Cm /
and edit your
.Pa /etc/fstab
file to reflect the new partition layout. Unless you are
familiar with 
.Xr ex 1
or
.Xr ed 1 .
the easiest way to fix your
.Pa /etc/fstab
file
is probably to simply do a 
.Ic cat \*> /etc/fstab
and type in the corrected file in its entirety.
.It
Install the distribution sets. Keep in mind that the
.Nx \*V
distribution takes up a considerably larger amount of disk space than
did the 1.2 or 1.2.1 distributions. If you are using the Installer,
proceed normally (remember that you will need to mount non-root
partitions by hand using the MiniShell before installing). If you are
installing from within NetBSD, do the following:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd /
pax -zrvpe -f /path/to/base.tgz
.Ed
.Pp
Keep in mind that there is
no going back once you have installed the base set short of a complete
re-install of an earlier distribution. Continue with the appropriate
command line for each of the other sets you wish to install except for
the etc set. If you are in the Installer, open up the Minishell and do
the following:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd /tmp
exit
.Ed
Ignore the warning message this will cause. Now, use the Installer to
install the
.Sy etc No set (it will install into
.Pa /tmp No instead of the
.Pa /etc No directory). 
.Pp
If you are in NetBSD, do the following instead:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd /tmp
tar -zrvpe -f /path/to/etc.tgz
.Ed
.It
If you are in the Installer, quit it and boot into
.Nx
in single-user
mode. From there,
.Ic cd No to the Pa /tmp/etc
directory and compare each file
there with your old files in
.Pa /etc .
You will probably want to replace
some of your system configuration files, or incorporate some of the
changes in the new versions into yours. You should take note of the
following when upgrading to the
.Nx \*V
etc.tgz set:
.Bl -bullet
.It
The first file to pay attention to is /etc/rc.conf. This file did not
exist under
.Nx 1.2 ,
but it is used to configure the rc scripts
under
.Nx \*V .
Edit the file to your preferences, making sure
that you change the line that says:
.Dl rc_configured=NO
to read:
.Dl rc_configured=YES
.Pp
This will enable all of the options you have configured in /etc/rc.conf.
.It
The next important item to take note of is the new networking
configuration files. If you currently have an /etc/hostname.xxN file
(fill in the xx with either ae or sn and the X with a number), you will
need to convert it into an ifconfig.xxN file before networking
automatically works. The format for the new file is simply the
arguments which you would give to ifconfig on the command line. The
following is an example of the minimal ifconfig.xxN file:
.Dl inet hostname.domain.dom netmask 0xffffff00
Read the ifconfig(8) man page for more details on arguments to ifconfig.
Be sure to set
.Dl auto_ifconfig=YES
in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
to ensure that your network interfaces will be brought
up automatically on boot.
.It
Several of the options given to many of the file systems have changed,
and some of the file systems have changed names.
.Em \&It is imperative that
.Em you change any instances of
.Ic ufs Em in Pa /etc/fstab Em to
.Ic ffs .
To find out
more about different filesystem options, read the man page for the
associated mount command (e.g.
.Xr mount_mfs 8
for MFS filesystems; note:
FFS type filesystems are documented in the
.Xr mount 8
man page). If you
have not already done so, you may also need to correct
.Pa /etc/fstab
for a shift in the partition numbering scheme. See step 4 above for more
details.
.It
You will also probably want to upgrade your device nodes at this time
as well. Make sure you have installed the latest MAKEDEV script (it
should be included in the etc set) and perform the following commands:
.Dl cd /dev
.Dl sh MAKEDEV all
.El
.It
A number of binaries have changed their locations from
.Nx 1.2.1
to
.Nx \*V
(most of these have moved from
.Pa /sbin
to
.Pa /usr/sbin ) . No A few
binaries have been removed. It is probably best if you scan the
modification dates of the files in the
.Pa /sbin directory. If there are
files in the directory which have newer counterparts in the
.Pa /usr/sbin
directory, it is a very good idea to remove the older files (you will
probably run into difficulties later if you choose not to do this). 
You should also check the
.Pa /sbin , /bin , /usr/bin/ No , and
.Pa /usr/sbin
directories for old binaries that are no longer part of the NetBSD
distribution and delete them as well. In general, all the files in a
particular distribution should have similar modification dates, so
looking at these is a good way of determining a file's age.
.It
Run
.Ic fsck Fl f
to make sure that your filesystem is still consistent. If
fsck reports any errors, fix them by answering 
.Ic y
to its suggested
solutions 
.(tag Em Note:
if there are a large number of errors, you may wish
to stop and run 
.Ic fsck Fl fy
to automatically answer
.Ic yes
instead.
.tag)
.It
Exit from single-user mode and it should continue to boot into
multi-user mode.
.El
.Pp
At this point you have successfully upgraded to
.Nx \*V .
