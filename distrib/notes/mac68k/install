The installation can be broken down into three basic steps:
.Pp
.(bullet -compact
Run Mkfs to build a file system or file systems.
.It
Run the Installer to load the files onto your file systems.
.It
Run the Booter to boot the system.
.bullet)
.
.Ss2 Preparing the file system(s)
.
Double-click on the Mkfs application icon to start it up.
It will ask you for the SCSI-ID of the drive that you are installing upon.
Once this is selected, it will present a list of the partitions on that disk.
You must first convert the partitions to a type which
.Nx
can understand.
Select each partition on which you wish to build a file system and click on the
.Dq Change
button.
If you are placing the entire installation on a single partition, select the
.Dq NetBSD Root\*&Usr
radio button.
If you are using multiple partitions, select
.Dq NetBSD Root
for the root partition
.Pq Pa /
and
.Dq NetBSD Usr
for all the other partitions.
You should select
.Dq NetBSD Swap
for the swap partition.
.Pp
When you have finished converting each partition, select each partition and
click on the
.Dq Format
button.
You will now be asked for a bunch of
parameters for the hard drive and the file system.
Usually, you can just take the defaults.
If you are installing onto removable media (e.g. a Zip, Jaz, or Syquest),
please see the FAQ.
Note that although this dialog only has the
.Dq OK
button, you are not committed, yet.
Once you get the values you want, press the
.Dq OK
button.
A dialog will be presented at this point with two options:
.Dq Format
and
.Dq Cancel .
If you choose
.Dq Cancel ,
nothing will be written to your drive.
If you choose
.Dq Format ,
the program will
proceed to make a file system.
.Pp
Mkfs is not a well-behaved Macintosh application.
It will not allow any other tasks to run while it does
(cooperative multitasking at its best).
When it's finished, the program will put up a dialog to ask if you have
scanned the output for any error messages.
Usually there won't have been any errors, but do scan the output to make sure.
Simply click on the
.Dq "I Read It"
button and the program will quit.
.Pp
Repeat as necessary for any extra partitions that you wish to make
file systems on.
Note that you do
.Em not
need a file system on your swap partition.
.Pp
When you are finished, click on the
.Dq Done
button and choose
.Dq Quit
from the
.Dq File
menu to exit Mkfs.
.
.Ss2 Installing the files
.
Before using the Installer, it is probably a good idea to increase its
memory allocation.
Select the Installer icon by clicking on it and choose
.Dq Get Info
from the File menu.
Increase both the Minimum and Preferred sizes to as much as you can spare.
.Pp
Double-click on the Installer icon to start it up.
The Installer will
present the same SCSI-ID menu that Mkfs did.
Select the same SCSI-ID that you did for Mkfs \(em
i.e., the one you are installing onto.
.Pp
If you are installing onto a single root partition
.Pq Pa / ,
proceed to the
.Sx Installation\ of\ base\ files
section, below.
.Pp
If you have not created file systems for
.Pa /
(root),
.Pa usr ,
and any other file systems, go back to
.Sx Preparing the file system(s)
above.
.Pp
When you started the Installer, it mounted your root partition
.Pq Pa / .
Just before it printed,
.Pp
.Dl "Mounting partition 'A' as / ",
.Pp
it printed lines like:
.Pp
.Dl "sd1 at scsi ID 5" .
.Pp
This means that the device for SCSI-ID 5 is
.Li sd1 .
The partitions
are signified by a trailing letter.
For instance,
.Li sd1a
would be
the root partition
.Pq Pa /
of the second SCSI disk in the chain, and
.Li sd0g
would be the first Usr partition on the first SCSI disk.
.Pp
You will need to know the proper device to mount the remaining
partition(s) by hand:
.(enum -offset indent
Select
.Dq Build Devices
from the
.Dq File
menu.
.It
Select
.Dq Mini Shell
from the
.Dq File
menu.
.It
You can use the
.Ic disklabel
command to get a listing of
the available partitions and their types and sizes.
.It
Create the directory mount point(s) with the command:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "mkdir path"
.Pp
E.g. for the
.Pa /usr
partition type:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "mkdir /usr"
.It
Mount the file systems you wish with the command:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "mount device path"
For example, if you wish to mount a
.Pa /usr
partition from the first SCSI disk
.Li sd0 ,
on
.Pa /usr , No you would type:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "mount /dev/sd0g /usr"
.It
Type
.Dl # Ic "fstab force"
to create a proper
.Pa /etc/fstab
file.
.It
Type
.Ic quit
after you have mounted all the file systems.
.bullet)
.
.Ss2 Installation of base files
.
Select the
.Ic Install
menu item from the
.Ic File
menu and install
.Pa base.tgz , etc.tgz , netbsd.tgz ,
and any other sets you wish to
install	at this time.
(See the contents section for information about what's in each set.)
The Installer will print out the
filename of each file as it is installed, and will take quite some
time to install everything (the base package alone can take over an
hour on a slow hard drive).
.Pp
As is the case with Mkfs, this is not a particularly well-behaved
Macintosh application and the machine will be completely tied up
while the installation takes place.
.Pp
At some point after installing the base set, select the
.Ic Build Devices
option from the
.Ic File
menu if you have not already done so.
This will create a bunch of device nodes for you and will
create your initial
.Pa /etc/fstab .
The Installer program also has an
option to give you a mini-shell.
Do not use this unless you are sure know what you are doing.
.Pp
When you are finished installing all of the sets you wish to
install, exit the Installer by choosing
.Ic Quit No from the Ic File
.No menu.
.
.Ss2 Booting the system
.
Prior to attempting to boot
.Nx*M ,
please verify that all of
the following are true:
.(enum
32-bit addressing is enabled [1] in the Memory control panel;
.It
All forms of virtual memory are disabled (the Memory control
panel, RAM Doubler, or other software-based memory enhancement
products); and
.It
Your system is in B\*&W mode (1-bit color or grayscale) as shown
by the Monitors control panel.
You may choose to have the Booter do this for you automatically by
selecting the appropriate check box and radio button in the
.Ic Monitors No dialog on the
.Ic Options No menu .
.enum)
.Pp
It is probably best to boot your machine with all extensions turned
off [1].
You can do this by booting into
.Tn MacOS
with the
.Key SHIFT
key held down.
You may have to restart your Macintosh for changes to take effect
before proceeding.
.(tag [1]
.It [1]
If your version of the Memory control panel does not have a 32-bit
addressing mode radio button, this means that your system is already
32-bit clean and is running in 32-bit addressing mode by default.
If the Booter complains that you are not in 32-bit mode,
it may be necessary for you to press the
.Dq Use Defaults
button in the Memory control panel to restore 32-bit addressing.
You should probably reboot after doing so.
If you have an older II-class system (including the II, IIx, IIcx,
and SE/30), it is necessary to install Connectix's MODE32 to work around
ROM issues which prevent you from enabling 32-bit addressing.

.tag)
.Pp
Double-click on the
.Nx*M
Booter icon to start the application.
Select
.Ic Booting
from the
.Ic Options
menu.
Check that all of the items in the resulting dialog look sane \(em
especially the SCSI-ID.
If not, correct them to your preference
(the SCSI-ID should be the only thing you need to change).
When you are satisfied with your choices, try booting
.Nx
by selecting
.Ic Boot Now No from the
.Ic Options No menu.
.Pp
If you wish to save your preferences, choose
.Ic Save Options
from the
.Ic File
menu before Booting (your preferences will not be saved if you
forget to do this).
.Pp
If the system does not come up, send mail to
.Mt port-\*M@netbsd.org
describing your software, your hardware, and as complete a description of
the problem as you can.
.Pp
If the system does come up, congratulations, you have successfully installed
.Nx \*V .
