The installation can be broken down into three basic steps:
	* Run Mkfs to build a filesystem or filesystems.
	* Run the Installer to load the files onto your filesystems.
	* Run the Booter to boot the system.

**** Preparing the filesystem(s)

Double-click on the Mkfs application icon to start it up.  It will ask
you for the SCSI ID of the drive that you are installing upon.  Once
this is selected, it will present a list of the partitions on that disk.
You must first convert the partitions to a type which NetBSD can
understand. Select each partition on which you wish to build a filesystem
and click on the "Change" button.  If you are placing the entire
installation on a single partition, select the "NetBSD Root&Usr" radio
button.  If you are using multiple partitions, select "NetBSD Root" for
the root partition and "NetBSD Usr" for all the other partitions.  You
should select "NetBSD Swap" for the swap partition.

When you have finished converting each partition, select each partition
and click on the "Format" button.  You will now be asked for a bunch of
parameters for the hard drive and the filesystem.  Usually, you can just
take the defaults.  If you are installing onto removable media (e.g. a
Zip, Jaz, or Syquest), please see the FAQ.  Note that although this
dialog only has the "OK" button, you are not committed, yet.  Once you
get the values you want, press the "OK" button. A dialog will be
presented at this point with two options: "Format" and "Cancel."  If you
choose "Cancel," nothing will be written to your drive.  If you choose
"Format," the program will proceed to make a filesystem.

Mkfs is not a well-behaved Macintosh application.  It will not allow
any other tasks to run while it does (cooperative multitasking at its
best).  When it's finished, the program will put up a dialog to ask if
you have scanned the output for any error messages.  Usually there won't
have been any errors, but do scan the output to make sure.  Simply click
on the "I Read It" button and the program will quit.

Repeat as necessary for any extra partitions that you wish to make
filesystems on.  Note that you do _not_ need a filesystem on your swap
partition.

When you are finished, click on the "Done" button and choose "Quit" from
the "File" menu to exit Mkfs.

**** Installing the files

Before using the Installer, it is probably a good idea to increase its
memory allocation.  Select the Installer icon by clicking on it and
choose "Get Info" from the File menu.  Increase both the Minimum and
Preferred sizes to as much as you can spare.

Double-click on the Installer icon to start it up.  The Installer
will present the same SCSI ID menu that Mkfs did.  Select the same SCSI
ID that you did for mkfs--i.e., the one you are installing onto.

If you are installing onto a single root partition, proceed to the
"Installation of base files" section, below.

	If you have not created filesystems for the root, usr, and
	any other filesystems, go back to "Preparing the filesystem(s),"
	above.

	When you started the Installer, it mounted your root partition.
	Just before it printed, "Mounting partition 'A' as /," it printed
	lines like:
		sd1 at scsi ID 5.
	This means that the device for scsi ID 5 is sd1.  The partitions
	are signified by a trailing letter.  For instance, sd1a would be
	the root partition of the second scsi disk in the chain, and sd0g
	would be the first usr partition on the first scsi disk.

	You will need to know the proper device to mount the remaining
	partition(s) by hand:

		* Select "Build Devices" from the "File" menu.

		* Select "Mini Shell" from the "File" menu.

		* You can use the 'disklabel' command to get a listing of
		  the available partitions and their types and sizes.

		* Mount the filesystems you wish with the command:
			mount device path
		  For example, if you wish to mount a usr partition from
		  the first scsi disk, sd0, on /usr, you would type:
			mount /dev/sd0g /usr

		* Type "fstab force" to create a proper /etc/fstab file

		* Type "quit" after you have mounted all the filesystems.

Installation of base files:

	Select the "Install" menu item from the "File" menu and install
	base13, etc13, netbsd13, and any other packages you wish to install 		 
	at this time (see the contents section for information about what's
	in each package).  The Installer will print out the filename of
	each file as it is installed, and will take quite some time to
	install everything (the base package alone can take over an hour
	on a slow hard drive).

	As is the case with Mkfs, this is not a particularly well-behaved
	Macintosh application and the machine will be completely tied up
	while the installation takes place.

	At some point after installing the base package, select the "Build
	Devices" option from the "File" menu if you have not already done so. 	
	This will create a bunch of device nodes for you and will create your 
	initial /etc/fstab.  The Installer program also has an option to give 	
	you a mini-shell.  Do not use this unless you are sure know what you 
	are doing.

	When you are finished installing all of the packages you wish to 
	install, exit the Installer by choosing "Quit" from the "File" menu.
	
**** Booting the system

Prior to attempting to boot NetBSD/mac68k, please verify that all of
the following are true:

	1) 32-bit addressing is enabled[*] in the Memory control panel;

	2) All forms of virtual memory are disabled (the Memory control
	   panel, RAM Doubler, or other software-based memory enhancement
	   products); and

	3) Your system is in B&W mode (1-bit color or grayscale) as shown
	   by the Monitors control panel.  You may choose to have the 
	   Booter do this for you automatically by selecting the appropriate
	   check box and radio button in the "Monitors" dialog on the
	   "Options" menu.

You may have to restart your Macintosh for changes to take effect before
proceding.

[* NOTE:  If you have an older II-class system (including the II, IIx, IIcx,
and SE/30), it is necessary to install Connectix's MODE32 to work around
ROM issues which prevent you from enabling 32-bit addressing.  Please see
<http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/mac68k/faq/> for more information.]

Double-click on the NetBSD/mac68k Booter icon to start the application.
Select "Booting" from the "Options" menu.  Check that all of the items in
the resulting dialog look sane--especially the SCSI ID.  If not, correct
them to your preference (the SCSI ID should be the only thing you need to
change).  When you are satisfied with your choices, try booting NetBSD by
selecting "Boot Now" from the "Options" menu.

If you wish to save your preferences, choose "Save Options" from the
"File" menu, then quit the application and restart it.  Due to a
long-standing bug, the preferences will not be saved unless you quit and
restart the Booter.

If the system does not come up, send mail to scottr@netbsd.org describing
your software, your hardware, and as complete a description of the
problem as you can.

If the system does come up, congratulations, you have successfully
installed NetBSD _VER.  When you reboot into NetBSD, you should log
in as "root" at the login prompt.  There is no initial password, but
if you're using the machine in a networked environment, you should
create yourself an account and protect it and the "root" account with
good passwords.

Some of the files in the NetBSD _VER distribution might need to be
tailored for your site.  In particular, the /etc/sendmail.cf file will
almost definitely need to be adjusted, and other files in /etc will
probably need to be modified, as well.  If you are unfamiliar with
UN*X-like system administration, it's recommended that you buy a book
that discusses it.
