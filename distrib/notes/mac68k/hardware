.Nx*M
\*V runs on several of the older Macintosh computers.
About 4 MB of RAM is sufficient to boot a stripped-down custom kernel, and a
subset of the system can be squeezed onto a 40 MB hard disk with considerable
creativity and persistence. However, an 80 MB disk should be considered a
practical minimum, and to do anything more interesting than booting at least
8 MB of RAM and more disk space is recommended.
About 180 MB will be necessary to install all of the
.Nx*M
\*V binary system distribution
sets (note that this does not count swap space!). You can drop this
to 150 MB if you choose not to install
the binary X11 distribution sets. Much more disk space is
required to install the source and objects as well; a complete source
distribution, including X11, consumes nearly 1 GB of storage.
.Pp
Please note that to install
.Nx*M
\*V using the
.Ic sysinst
method, your system must have a minimum of 6 MB of RAM and 60 MB of
available disk space (i.e. not part of an in-use HFS partition).

If your 68030 system is not listed above, it may be because of a problem
with accessing onboard video, and it may still work with a serial console.
Some of the known ones in this category:

.Pp
If your 68LC040 system is not listed above, it is due to a problem with
floating point emulation (FPE) for this type of processor. Machines in
this category include:

Macintosh IIfx
.Pp
This machine has unusual custom chips for the ADB and serial interfaces
which make support for it difficult. Work is in progress on this, though.
.It
Quadra 900/950
.Pp
These machines have I/O processor chips for their ADB interfaces similar to
those used in the IIfx and thus face similar support problems. Note that you
can use a serial console on these systems.
.It
PowerPC-based Macs
.Pp
This is a separate effort from the \*M port. PowerMacs use hardware that
is often fairly different from that of the \*M port.  If you are
interested in this, you might want to take a look at the new
.Nx Ns /macppc
port:

.Ss2 Known hardware issues with this release
.(bullet -offset indent
Real Time Clock
.Pp
Due to oddities of the Macintosh hardware interrupt priority scheme,
.Nx*M
keeps very poor time. Under a high interrupt load (e.g.
SCSI or serial port activity) , a machine can lose several minutes
per hour. A consequence of this problem is that attempting to run
.Ic ntpd
is generally rather pointless.
.It
SCSI difficulties
.Pp
The
.Nx*M
SCSI drivers are not quite as
robust as their
.Tn Mac OS
counterparts. Symptoms of these
problems are that some SCSI disks will not work under
NetBSD that work fine under
.Tn Mac OS .
Other problems include
occasional file system corruption with some types of drives
and the general unreliability of removable SCSI media.
Keep in mind that there are no clear patterns with these
problems, and they do not appear to affect the majority of
users.
