is a port based on Motorola's
.Tn "SandPoint"
evaluation system.
The
.Tn "SandPoint"
is the successor to the
.Tn "Yellowknife"
system.
Based on the
.Tn "SandPoint"
824x architecture several consumer directed NAS (Network Attached Storage)
systems were published.
The main focus of this port is on these systems, while the original
evaluation boards are still supported.
