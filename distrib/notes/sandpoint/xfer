.\" --------- instructions for getting distribution off installation medium
.
Installation is supported from several media types, including:
.Pp
.(bullet -offset indent -compact
FTP
.
.It
Remote NFS partition
.
.bullet)
.Pp
.
The steps necessary to prepare the distribution sets for installation
depend upon which installation medium you choose.
The steps for the various media are outlined below.
.
.(tag CD-ROM\ /\ DVD
.
.It Em FTP
The preparations for this installation/upgrade method are
easy; all you need to do is make sure that there's an FTP
site from which you can retrieve the
.Nx
distribution when you're about to
install or upgrade.
If you don't have DHCP available on your network,
you will need to know the numeric IP address of that site, and,
if it's not on a network directly connected to the machine
on which you're installing or upgrading
.Nx ,
you need to know the numeric IP address of the router closest
to the
.Nx
machine.
Finally, you need to know the numeric IP address of the
.Nx
machine itself.
If you don't have access to a functioning nameserver during
installation, the IPv4 address of
.Sy ftp.NetBSD.org
is
.Li 199.233.217.201
(as of November, 2019).
.Pp
Once you have this information, you can proceed to the next
step in the installation or upgrade process.
If you're installing
.Nx
from scratch, go to the section on preparing your hard disk, below.
If you're upgrading an existing installation, go directly to
the section on upgrading.
.
.It Em NFS
Place the
.Nx
distribution sets you wish to install into a
directory on an NFS server, and make that directory mountable
by the machine on which you are installing or upgrading
.Nx .
This will probably require modifying the
.Pa /etc/exports
file on the NFS server and resetting its mount daemon (mountd).
(Both of these actions will probably require superuser
privileges on the server.)
.Pp
You need to know the numeric IP address of the NFS server,
and, if you don't have DHCP available on your network and
the server is not on a network directly connected to
the machine on which you're installing or upgrading
.Nx ,
you need to know the numeric IP address of the router closest
to the
.Nx
machine.
Finally, you need to know the numeric IP address of the
.Nx
machine itself.
.Pp
Once the NFS server is set up properly and you have the
information mentioned above, you can proceed to the next step
in the installation or upgrade process.
If you're installing
.Nx
from scratch, go to the section on preparing your hard disk, below.
If you're upgrading an existing installation, go directly to the
section on upgrading.
