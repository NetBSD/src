To install
.Nx \*V
on your 824x based NAS system you need to get access to its serial console.
This requires to open the case, locate the serial header on the main board
and attach a (usually
.Tn "MAX232"
based) RS/232 cable to it, which you will
connect to a terminal.
The detailed procedure to build such a cable for your NAS system is not
part of this documentation.
.
.Ss2 netboot
The
.Pa netboot.bin
binary loads a
.Nx
kernel from the root parition of a local disk or from NFS.
This file should be made available by one of the following methods
(depending on the firmware):

TFTP server
.It
Serial line upload
.It
Flash ROM
.bullet)
.Pp
In most cases the Flash ROM of your NAS will contain
.Tn "PPCBoot"
or
.Tn "U-Boot"
as firmware. You have to find a way to get access to its command line.
When auto-booting is enabled this will usually require to press a key
quickly after the system is switched on.
Then load the
.Pa netboot.bin
file into memory at
.Pa 0x1000000
and start it with
