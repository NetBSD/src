To install
.Nx \*V
on your 824x based NAS system you need to get access to its serial console.
This requires to open the case, locate the serial header on the main board
and attach a (usually
.Tn "MAX232"
based) RS/232 cable to it, which you will
connect to a terminal.
The procedure how to build such a cable for your NAS system is not
part of this documentation. Please refer to
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/ports/\*M/ttl2rs232.html
for schematics and detailed instructions, if you wish to solder such an
adapter cable yourself.
