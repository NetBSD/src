.Ss2 Prepare the NFS or TFTP server
.
Set up an NFS server and copy the install kernel renamed into
.Pa netbsd
to its root partition. Optionally copy the kernel into your TFTP directory
and make sure the
.Pa tftpd
service is running.
.
.Ss2 The altboot bootloader
The
.Pa altboot.bin
binary file loads a
.Nx
kernel from the root partition of a local disk, from TFTP or from NFS.
This bootloader binary should be made available by one of the following
methods (depending on the firmware):
.(bullet -compact
TFTP server
.It
NFS server
.It
Serial line upload
.It
Flash ROM
.bullet)
.Pp
When your firmware is restricted to
.Pa bootm
as the only command to run a program you should use
.Pa altboot.img
, which fakes a Linux kernel module.
.
.Ss2 Booting the installer
Depending on whether the serial console is attached to the first or the
second UART you will have to boot
.Pa netbsd-INSTALL
(1st UART at 0x4500)
or
.Pa netbsd-INSTALL_KURO
(2nd UART at 0x4600).
KuroBox and LinkStation systems are known to have the console on the
second UART.
.Pp
In most cases your NAS will run
.Tn "PPCBoot"
or
.Tn "U-Boot"
as firmware. You can access its command line via the serial adapter cable.
When auto-booting is enabled this will usually require to press a key
quickly after the system was switched on.
Then load the
.Pa altboot.bin
file into memory at
.Pa 0x1000000
and boot the installation kernel with
.Pp
.Dl > Ic "go 0x1000000 tftp:"
.Pp
for TFTP, or with
.Pp
.Dl > Ic "go 0x1000000 nfs:"
.Pp
when the kernel resides on NFS.
.Pp
Note, that when using
.Pa altboot.img
with
.Pa bootm
instead of
.Pa altboot.bin
you have to pass arguments like
.Pa tftp:
or
.Pa nfs:
in the
.Pa bootargs
environment variable.
.Pp
The installation kernel will run
.Pa sysinst
from an internal memory disk image.
.
.so ../common/sysinst
