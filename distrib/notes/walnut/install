.
.Ss2 Example of a normal boot
.
If you already configured the network settings, just press

.Ss2 Common Problems and Error Messages
.
Do not use the plain ELF kernel as the file provided to the
firmware, use the
.Dq netbsd.img
file (which is in the format the firmware expects).
Of course, you should put the matching
.Dq netbsd
as
.Pa /netbsd
on your root file system, otherwise some kernel grovellers won't work.
