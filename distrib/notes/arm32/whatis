NetBSD/arm32 _VER is the first official binary release of NetBSD for the
arm32 platform, although binary release have been available in the past
under a different name (RiscBSD).

The _VER release brings with it two major enhancements; full shared
library support, and soft-float library support.

Because of this some of your existing binaries will require
recompilation. But the up side is that they should run faster.
