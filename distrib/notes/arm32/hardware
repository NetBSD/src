NetBSD/arm32 \*V runs on several systems with
.Tn ARM6
or above processors,
with or without FPU coprocessor. The minimal configuration is said to
require 8M of RAM and 50M of disk space, though we do not know of anyone
running with a system quite this minimal today. To install the entire
system requires much more disk space (the unpacked binary distribution,
without sources, requires at least 65M without counting space needed for
swap space, etc), and to run X or compile the system, more RAM is
recommended. (8M of RAM will actually allow you to run X and/or compile,
but it won't be speedy. Note that until you have around 16M of RAM,
getting more RAM is more important than getting a faster CPU.)

Drivers for hardware marked with "[*]" are NOT present in installation
kernels.

Support for some devices is limited to particular kernels. eg there is no
SA110 support in A7000 kernels.

Hardware the we do NOT currently support, but get many questions
about:

Any SCSI card using a PowerROM.
.It
Podule based serial ports.
.It
Castle SCSI/Ethernet cards.

Drivers are planned for some of the above devices.
