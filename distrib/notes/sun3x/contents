The sun3x-specific portion of the NetBSD _VER release is found in the
"sun3x" subdirectory of the distribution.  That subdirectory is laid
out as follows:

.../NetBSD-_VER/sun3x/
	INSTALL			Installation notes; this file.

	installation/
		miniroot/	sun3x miniroot image
		netboot/	sun3x network boot support
		tapeimage/	sun3x boot tape support

	binary/
		kernel/		sun3x kernels
		sets/		sun3x binary distribution sets
		security/	sun3x security distribution

Detailed content descriptions by directory:

.../sun3x/installation/

Files and scripts used during installation.  This distribution
supports installation of NetBSD/sun3x onto a sun3x with no previous
operating system, with initial boot from network or tape.  See
"Getting the NetBSD System onto Useful Media" for instructions
on either method.

.../sun3x/installation/miniroot/

	miniroot.gz	A gzipped copy of the miniroot filesystem.
			This image is to be un-gzipped and copied
			into the swap area of a disk.

.../sun3x/installation/netboot/

	netboot		A copy of the network boot program.
			This is useful if you are installing
			a diskless NetBSD/sun3x system.

.../sun3x/installation/tapeboot/

	MakeBootTape	A script for creating the boot tape.

	MakeInstTape	A script for creating the install tape.

	tapeboot	A copy of the tape boot program, used
			as the first segment of a boot tape.

.../sun3x/binary/kernel/

	netbsd-gen.gz	A gzipped GENERIC kernel (for upgrade)

	netbsd-rd.gz	A gzipped copy of the "RAMDISK kernel"
			for installing the miniroot filesystem.

.../sun3x/binary/sets/

The NetBSD/sun3x binary distribution sets contain the binaries which
comprise the NetBSD _VER release for the sun3x.  There are seven binary
distribution sets and the "security" distribution set.  The binary
distribution sets can be found in the "sun3x/binary/sets" subdirectory
of the NetBSD _VER distribution tree, and are as follows:

	base	The NetBSD/sun3x _VER base binary distribution.  You
		MUST install this distribution set.  It contains the
		base NetBSD utilities that are necessary for the
		system to run and be minimally functional.  It
		includes shared library support, and excludes
		everything described below.
		[ 9M gzipped, 26M uncompressed ]

	comp	The NetBSD/sun3x Compiler tools.  All of the tools
		relating to C, C++, and FORTRAN (yes, there are two!).
		This set includes the system include files
		(/usr/include), the linker, the compiler tool chain,
		and the various system libraries (except the shared
		libraries, which are included as part of the base
		set).  This set also includes the manual pages for all
		of the utilities it contains, as well as the system
		call and library manual pages.
		[ 7M gzipped, 24M uncompressed ]

	etc	This distribution set contains the system configuration
		files that reside in /etc and in several other places.
		This set MUST be installed if you are installing the
		system from scratch, but should NOT be used if you are
		upgrading.  (If you are upgrading, it's recommended that
		you get a copy of this set and CAREFULLY upgrade your
		configuration files by hand.)
		[ 54K gzipped, 330K uncompressed ]

	games	This set includes the games and their manual pages.
		[ 3M gzipped, 7M uncompressed ]

	man	This set includes all of the manual pages for the
		binaries and other software contained in the base set.
		Note that it does not include any of the manual pages
		that are included in the other sets.
		[ 3M gzipped, 10M uncompressed ]

	misc	This set includes the system dictionaries (which are
		rather large), the typesettable document set, and
		man pages for other architectures which happen to be
		installed from the source tree by default.
		[ 2M gzipped, 8M uncompressed ]

	text	This set includes NetBSD's text processing tools,
		including groff, all related programs, and their
		manual pages.
		[ 1M gzipped, 4M uncompressed ]

.../sun3x/binary/security/

Contains executables which are built from the "src/domestic"
portion if the NetBSD source tree.  It can only be found on those
sites which carry the complete NetBSD distribution and that can
legally obtain it.  (Remember, because of United States law, it
may not be legal to distribute this set to locations outside of
the United States and Canada.)
	[ 128K gzipped, 275K uncompressed ]

The sun3x binary distribution sets are distributed as gzipped tar files
named with the extension ".tgz", e.g. "base.tgz".  Each sun3x binary
distribution set also has its own checksum files, just as the source
distribution sets do.

The instructions given for extracting the source sets work equally
well for the binary sets, but it is worth noting that if you use that
method, the files are extracted "below" the current directory.  That
is, if you want to extract the binaries "into" your system, i.e.
replace the system binaries with them, you have to run the commands:

	cd /
	tar -zrvpe -f set.tar.gz
