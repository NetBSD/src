	$NetBSD: upgrade,v 1.2 1998/01/09 18:47:46 perry Exp $	

NetBSD _VER is the first release in which NetBSD/sun3x is available.
Therefore, there is no official upgrade path.  However, there may
be some who have installed a snapshot of the port while it was still
in development.  These notes are included for them.

The miniroot image contains an upgrade program which was originally copied
from the NetBSD/sun3 distribution.  However, it cannot be used with
NetBSD/sun3x because it expects a NetBSD/sun3 1.2 setup.

However, while using the miniroot's upgrade program is the preferred method
of upgrading your system, it is still possible to upgrade your system
manually.  To do this, follow the following procedure:

	* Place _at least_ the `base' binary set in a filesystem
	  accessible to the target machine.  A local filesystem
	  is preferred, since the NFS subsystem in the NetBSD _VER
	  kernel may be incompatible with your old binaries.

	* Back up your pre-existing kernel and copy the _VER
	  kernel into your root partition.

	* Reboot with the _VER kernel into single-user mode.
	  (Otherwise you can not install the boot block.)

	* Check all filesystems:

		/sbin/fsck -pf

	* Mount all local filesystems:

		/sbin/mount -a -t nonfs

	* If you keep /usr or /usr/share on an NFS server, you
	  will want to mount those filesystems as well.  To do
	  this, you will need to enable the network:

		sh /etc/netstart

	* Run the update(8) daemon, to ensure that new programs
	  are actually stored on disk.

		update

	* Make sure you are in the root filesystem and extract
	  the `base' binary set:

		cd /
		tar --unlink -zxvpf /path/to/base.tar.gz

	  NOTE: the `--unlink' option is _very_ important!

	* Install a new boot block:
	  (assuming root is on /dev/rsd0a)

		cd /usr/mdec
		cp -p ./ufsboot /mnt/ufsboot
		sync ; sleep 1 ; sync
		./installboot -v /ufsboot bootxx /dev/rsd0a

	* Sync the filesystems:

		sync

	* At this point you may extract any other binary sets
	  you may have placed on local filesystems, or you may
	  wish to extract additional sets at a later time.
	  To extract these sets, use the following commands:

		cd /
		tar --unlink -zxvpf <path to set>

NOTE: you SHOULD NOT extract the `etc' set if upgrading.  Instead, you
should extract that set into another area and carefully merge the changes
by hand.
