First-time installation on a bare machine is not supported, because most
DECstations do not have any suitable load device.  Some versions of
DECstation PROMs are buggy and will not boot via TFTP/bootp; still
other versions are buggy and do not boot via MOP.

The only DECstation with a floppy-disk drive is the Personal Decstation,
and that device is not supported as a boot device.

The recommended installation procedure is to boot a miniroot via TFTP,
or to use a "helper" system to write a miniroot onto a disk, move that
disk to the target installation system, and then boot the miniroot.

Once the miniroot is booted, a disklabel should be written.
At that point, 

Installation is supported from several media types, including:
	NFS partitions
	FTP
	Tape

The steps necessary to prepare the distribution sets
for installation depend on which method of installation
you choose.  The various methods are explained below.

To prepare for installing via an NFS partition:

	Place the NetBSD software you wish to install into
	a directory on an NFS server, and make that directory
	mountable by the machine which you will be installing
	NetBSD on.  This will probably require modifying the
	/etc/exports file of the NFS server, and resetting
	mountd. Both these actions  will require superuser
	privileges on the NFS server.  Note the numeric IP address
	of the NFS server.   If the NFS server is not on a network
	which is directly attached to the NetBSD machine, you must
	also note the numeric address of the router closest to the the
	new NetBSD machine.


	If you are using a diskless setup to install NetBSD on
	your machine, you can take advantage of the fact that
	the above has already been done on your machine's server.
	So, you can conveniently put the NetBSD filesets in your
	machine's root filesystem on the server where the install
	program can find them.

	Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next
	step in the installation process, preparing your
	system for NetBSD installation.


To prepare for installing via FTP:

	NOTE: this method of installation is recommended
	      only for those already familiar with using
	      the BSD network-manipulation commands and
	      interfaces.  If you aren't, this documentation
	      should help, but is not intended to be
	      all-encompassing.

	The preparations for this method of installation
	are easy: all you have to do is make sure that
	there's some FTP site from which you can retrieve
	the NetBSD installation when it's time to do
	the install.  You should know the numeric IP
	address of that site, the numeric IP address of
	your nearest router if one is necessary

	Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next
	step in the installation process, preparing your
	system for NetBSD installation.


To prepare for installing via a tape:

	To install NetBSD from a tape, you need to somehow
	get the NetBSD filesets you wish to install on
	your system on to the appropriate kind of tape,
	in tar format.

		NOTE: the tape devices with which NetBSD/pmax is
		beleived to work is the DEC TK-50. This is a very slow
		device.  Installation via disk or network is recommended
		if at all possible.

	If you're making the tape on a UN*X system, the easiest
	way to do so is:

		tar cvf <tape_device> <files>

	where "<tape_device>" is the name of the tape device
	that describes the tape drive you're using (possibly
	something like /dev/nrst0, but we make no guarantees 8-).
	Under SunOS 5.x, this would be something like /dev/rmt/0mbn.
	Again, your mileage may vary.  If you can't figure it out,
	ask your system administrator.  "<files>" are the names
	of the "set_name.nnn" files which you want to be placed
	on the tape.

	Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next
	step in the installation process, preparing your 
	system for NetBSD installation.
