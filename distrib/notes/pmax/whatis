This is the fourth public major release of NetBSD for the DECstation
and DECsystem family of computers.  Significantly, this is the first
release for the pmax that builds completely from in-tree source code.
Some other pmax-specific changes from the 1.3 release include:
.(bullet
A much easier-to-use ramdisk-based install procedure.
.It
New two-stage disk bootblocks that can load a.out, ECOFF
and ELF kernels.
.It
a.out kernels are no longer built.  ELF is the preferred format
for kernels loaded off disk, and ECOFF kernels are still required
for netbooting.  a.out kernels will still boot.
.It
Better support for SFB graphics cards running at
different resolutions.
.It
.Nx*M
now uses the X11R6 Xserver.
.It
Mouse problems in X on 5000/xx machines have been significantly
reduced.
.It
Some improvements in the SCSI driver for the 5000/200 (although
some problems are still thought to exist).
.It
scc serial driver will work up to 115.2k bps on some
systems.
.It
Reworked model-dependent code, including support for 5100 (but not
recently tested on this machine).
.It
Crash dumps now work.
.It
Switched to in-tree ld.elf_so.
.It
Breakpoints in gdb work more reliably for R3000 systems (although
there still may be some problems with R4X00 systems).
