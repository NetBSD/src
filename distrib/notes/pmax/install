Reminder:
	Always back up files before installing or upgrading.
	If installing from source,  always install and boot a new kernel
	before installing a new userland!


If at all possible, you should consult the ``Installation Guide''
document on the NetBSD/pmax web page, at http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/pmax.
It has not been possible to reproduce the pmax installation Web page
in fixed-font hardcopy format for the _VER release.  You must either visit
the URL above, or request a rendered version (e.g., PostScript).

Please check the NetBSD/pmax _VER installation instructions at

    http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/pmax/pmax-install.html

now, and return to this document when you used those instructions to
install a diskimage, and used sysinst to label a disk and extract the
NetBSD/pmax _VER installation tar sets.


Install via the NetBSD CDROM.
-----------------------------

You can obtain the disk image or diskless boot tar file from the
NetBSD _VER CDROM.


To mount the CDROM from a NetBSD/pmax host, type

	mount -r -t cd9660 /dev/rzXc /mnt

and from an Ultrix host

	mount -r -t cdfs -o nodefperm,noversion /dev/rzXc /mnt

where X is the SCSI id of the CDROM.


** NOTE:  Ultrix does not have Rock Ridge extensions so leave out
everything between the first and last . in the paths on the CD.
For example, the path NetBSD-1.3.2 would show up as NetBSD-1.2.


The diskimage file can be found on the CDROM at the following
location (relative to the mount point of the CD)

	NetBSD-_VER/pmax/installation/diskimage/diskimage.gz

and the diskless boot tar file can be found at

	NetBSD-_VER/pmax/installation/netboot/diskimage.tgz

Once you have located these files, continue on to either the "Install
via diskless boot", "Install via diskimage" or "Installing from Ultrix"
section later in the INSTALL notes.



Install via diskless boot.
--------------------------

The preferred path is to upgrade or install by diskless-booting a
minimal system via NFS, and using that to upgrade or install.  The
file
	installation/netboot/diskimage.tar.gz

contains a suitable set of files. (it is a tar copy of the contents of
a root filesystem diskimage) .  You will need to find an NFS server,
unpack the tarfile, and setup BOOTP/dhcp service for your pmax.
Complete instructions are in the installation notes or the pmax web
page.

Since the system install utility, sysinst, requires a read/write root,
netbooting is only feasible if your NFS server exports the diskless
root read-write.  If this is not possible, you should install via
diskimage.



Install via diskimage.
----------------------

If netbooting with a _writable_ NFS root is not possible, the
recommended installation is to unpack and copy a diskimage onto the
raw partition of a disk.  The diskimage file is in

installation/diskimage/diskimage.gz

is shipped compressed and is around 8020 kBytes; it uncompresses to
exactly 32Mbytes.

To install the diskimage onto disk rzX on a NetBSD/pmax system, do:
	disklabel -W /dev/rrzXc
	gunzip -c diskimage.gz | dd of=/dev/rrzXc bs=10240

When installing on a disk with not NetBSD or Ultrix label, you may get a
message like:
	rzX: WARNING: trying Ultrix label, no disk label
or when installing on an old Ultrix disk, you may get a message like:
	rzX: WARNING: using ULTRIX partition information
when issuing the "disklabel -W /dev/rrzXc" command.  This can safely be
ignored.

Most other NetBSD ports are similar, but use rsdXc instead of rrzXc.

On NetBSD/i386, the `raw disk partition' is the 'd' parttion, so do:
	disklabel -W /dev/rsdXd
	gunzip -c diskimage.gz | dd of=/dev/rsdXd bs=10240

On NetBSD, be sure to use disklabel -W to enable writing to the label
area of the disk. If you forget this and/or use the `block' device,
the dd command will silently fail.

On MS-DOS, use an unzip utlility, then use rawrite.

Then boot using, e.g,
	>> boot -f rz(0,X,0)netbsd		# 3100
	>> boot 5/rzX/netbsd 			# 5000/200
	>> boot 3/rzX/netbsd			# other machines

	(NOTE: replace the X with the unit number of your disk:
         boot 3/rz2/netbsd to boot drive 2 on a 5000/xxx.)

then continue from ``Once you've booted the diskimage''.



Installing from Ultrix
----------------------

The Ultrix bootloader can boot ECOFF-format NetBSD kernels.
So the technique of dd'ing a disk image into swap, copying
a kernel to the root, and then booting via the "n" argument
should work with Ultrix too.  Since Ultrix cannot mount
4.4BSD format FFS filesystems, just dd the diskimage into
your swap partition, copy a netbsd.ecoff kernel from the FTP site,
and proceed from step #5 of the `Upgrade via diskimage' above.

You should do this from single-user mode, to ensure that swapping is
not enabled when you copy the diskimage into the swap partition.

On Ultrix, use the "chpt -q /dev/rz?c" command to be sure your swap
partition (typically "b") is big enough to hold the diskimage (32Mbytes
or more).

Again, be sure to specify the partition where you dd'ed the NetBSD
diskimage as your root device in step #7!


Details of dd'ing a disk image into the swap partition are covered in
the "QUICK.INSTALL" file, which should be in the same directory where
these install notes are located.



Once you've booted the diskimage
--------------------------------

Once you'e booted a diskimage and pointed the kernel at the approriate
devices to use for root, and dump, NetBSD kernel will prompt you for
a single-user shell;

	Enter pathname of shell or RETURN for sh: 

At this point, press the RETURN key.
then when you get a standalone root prompt, set your terminal type

	TERM=pmax; export TERM;

for a framebuffer console, or

	TERM=vt100; export TERM

if using a serial console with a vt100-compatible terminal.

Next, you need to ensure that the root filesystem is writable so that
sysinst can create temporary files, temporary disklabels, etc.
If you booted via NFS, the diskless root should already be writable.
If you booted from disk, type

	mount /dev/rzXY /

where X is the disk unit you booted from, and Y is either a or b,
(e.g., use /dev/rz2a for drive 2 with diskimage in the 'a' partition,
and rz2b for diskimage in swap.)


CD-ROM INSTALLATION NOTE:  If you are installing from a CD-ROM, sysinst
will offer you a default choice of "cd0" for the CD-ROM device.  Unlike
other NetBSD ports, NetBSD/pmax currently uses the same device driver
for both hard disks and CD-ROMs.  You will need to specify "rzX" (where
X is the SCSI id of the CD-ROM) as the CD-ROM device.  Also note that
sysinst doesn't expect a partition - just the base device.  If you still
have problems, you can try issuing the following command before starting
sysinst

	mount -r -t cd9660 /dev/rzXc /mnt2

where X is the SCSI id of the CD-ROM.  You can then ignore any errors
trying to mount the CD-ROM from within sysinst.


Then, start sysinst

	sysinst

Then, choose 'install' or 'upgrade'.

When you've finished the install/upgrade, be sure to edit /etc/rc.conf
and set "rc_configured" to YES when you are done.  If you're doing an
upgrade, merge your old etc from /etc.old into /etc.

You're then ready to reboot!



Post-intallation notes:
----------------------
Some of the files in the NetBSD _VER distribution might need to be
tailored for your site.  In particular, the /etc/sendmail.cf file will
almost definitely need to be adjusted, and other files in /etc will
probably need to be modified.  If you are unfamiliar with UN*X-like
system administration, it's recommended that you buy a book that
discusses it.

NetBSD/pmax 1.3 uses an X11R5 X server. These servers cannot read the
compressed fonts which are shipped with standard X11R6 configurations.

If you installed X11 and want to run a local Xserver, you must take
post-installation steps to make the X11R5 server work that are
standard for X11R6.3. The distribution file /usr/X11R6/bin/README.pmax
contains information on how to choose an Xserver and how to access
compressed fonts via a font server or to decompress the X fonts
after installation.  Please follow the directions there.
