NetBSD/pmax \*V runs on the following classes of machines:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
DECstation 2100 and 3100, also known as
.Em pmin No and Em pmax
.It
Personal DECstations (5000/20, /25 and /33) also known as
.Em MAXINE
.It
DECstation 5000/120, /125, and /133, also known as
.Em 3MIN
.It
DECstation 5000/200, also known as
.Em 3MAX
.It
DECstation 5000/240 and DECsystem 5900, also known as
.Em 3MAXPLUS
.It
DECstation 5000/50, 5000/150, 5000/260 (and DECsystem 5900-260) \- R4000
and R4400 variants of the
.Em MAXINE, 3MIN No and Em 3MAXPLUS
.El
.Pp
NetBSD/pmax \*V does
.Em not
(yet) run on these machines:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
DECsystem 5100 (an r3000-based cousin of the DECstation 3100)
.It
DECsystem 5400 and 5500 (Qbus-based systems, similar to the Vax
.Em Mayfair No \&or Em Mayfair II ,
but with an r2000a or r3000 cpu instead of a CVAX cpu.)
.It
DECsystem 5800 (xbi-based multiprocessor, a Vax 6200 with
Vax CPU boards replaced with Mips cpu boards)
.El
.Pp
The minimal configuration requires 8M of RAM and ~60M of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  (NetBSD with 8M of
RAM feels like Ultrix with 8M of RAM.)  Note that until you have
around 16M of RAM, getting more RAM is more important than getting a
faster CPU.

Supported devices include:
.Bl -bullet -compact

.		(Note
All supported DECstation video produces sync-on-green.
Be sure to use either a DEC-compatible fixed-sync monitor
or a multisync monitor that supports sync-on-green.

Hardware the we do
.Em not
currently support, but get questions about from time to time:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Q-bus DECsystem machines
.It
DECsystem 5100 machines
.It
PrestoServe NVRAM on DECsystem 5100 and 5000/2xx machines
.It
audio drivers for Personal DECstation machines
.It
floppy driver for Personal DECstation machines
.It
TurboChannel audio hardware (LoFi)
.El
.(Note
The primary obstacle to supporting the above is non-availability of sample 
hardware for development.
