DECsystem 5400 and 5500 (Q-bus based systems, similar to the Vax
.Em Mayfair No \&or Em Mayfair II ,

.Pp
The minimal configuration requires 8 MB of RAM and 100 MB of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended, as
.Nx
with 8 MB of RAM feels like
.Tn Ultrix
with 8 MB of RAM - slow.
Note that until you have around 16 MB of RAM, getting more RAM is more
important than getting a faster CPU.
