Installation is supported from several media types, including:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
TOS HD partitions
.It
Tape
.El
.Pp
No matter what you do, however, you'll need to have three disks handy,
on which you will put the install and boot floppy images.
.Pp
All the images are available from the directory "installation/floppies"
under the root of the NetBSD/atari tree at your favorite archive site.
.Pp
If you are using NetBSD/atari to make the floppies, you should use
the command dd(1) to write the raw floppy images (.fs files) to
the disk. As an example, to write the first part of the miniroot filesystem
onto a 720KB floppy in fd0 use:
.Dl dd if=miniroot.fs.1 of=/dev/rfd0b bs=9b
.Pp
If you are using TOS to make the floppies, grab the 'rawwrite' utility
from the "atari/utils" directory and issue the command:
.Dl rawwrite miniroot.fs
.Pp
This will create the boot-floppy on the floppy in drive a. The floppies
should be pre-formatted on 720Kb/1.44Mb for both the 'dd' and 'rawwrite'
commands to work. Pre-formatting can be best done using the desktop format
command.  Some other utilities seem to be giving problems.
.Pp
Since the 1.3 release, it is also possible to use HD-floppies. You should
than use the floppy device '/dev/rfd0c' or add the '-H' flag to 'rawwrite'.
.Pp
The steps necessary to prepare the distribution sets
for installation depend on which method of installation
you choose.  The various methods are explained below.
.Bl -bullet
.It
To prepare for installing via an GEMDOS partition:
.Pp
To install NetBSD from an GEMDOS partition, you need to
get the NetBSD distribution sets you wish to install
on your system on to an GEMDOS partition.
.Pp
Note where you placed the files, you will need this later.
.Pp
Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next
step in the installation process, preparing your hard disk.
.It
To prepare for installing via a tape:
.Pp
To install NetBSD from a tape, you need to somehow
get the NetBSD filesets you wish to install on
your system on to the appropriate kind of tape. If you make
the tape on a UN*X-like system, you can create it as follows:
.Bd -literal
cd .../NetBSD-1.3/atari/binary/sets
T=\*<tape_device\*>
mt -f $T rewind
for f in base etc comp games man misc text
	dd if=$f.tgz of=$T conv=sync bs=5k
done
mt -f $T rewind
.Ed
where "\*<tape_device\*>" is the name of the (non-rewinding!) tape
device that you're using (probably something like /dev/nrst0,
but we make no guarantees 8-).
If you can't figure it out, ask your system administrator.
.Pp
Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next
step in the installation process, preparing your hard disk.
