Installation is supported from several media types, including:
.Pp
.(bullet -compact -offset indent
.Tn GEMDOS Ns / Ns Tn TOS No HD partitions
.It
Tape
.bullet)
.Pp
No matter what you do, however, you'll need to have three disks handy,
on which you will put the install and boot floppy images.
.Pp
All the images are available from the directory
.Pa installation/floppies
under the root of the
.Nx*M
tree at your favorite archive site.
.Pp
If you are using
.Nx*M
to make the floppies, you should use
the command
.Xr dd 1
to write the raw floppy images (.fs files) to
the disk.
As an example, to write the first part of the miniroot file system
onto a 720 KB floppy in fd0 use:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "dd if=miniroot.fs.1 of=/dev/rfd0b bs=9b"
.Pp
If you are using
.Tn TOS
to make the floppies, grab the
.Ic rawwrite
utility from the
.Pa \*M/utils
directory and issue the command:
.Pp
.Dl Ic "rawwrite boot.fs"
.Pp
This will create the boot-floppy on the floppy in drive a.
The floppies should be pre-formatted on 720 KB / 1.44 MB for both the
.Ic dd
and
.Ic rawwrite
commands to work.
Pre-formatting can be best done using the desktop format command.
Some other utilities seem to be giving problems.
.Pp
Since the 1.3 release, it is also possible to use HD-floppies.
You should than use the floppy device
.Pa /dev/rfd0c
or add the
.Fl H
flag to
.Ic rawwrite .
.Pp
The steps necessary to prepare the distribution sets
for installation depend on which method of installation
you choose.
The various methods are explained below.
.(tag GEMDOSxx
.It Tn GEMDOS
To install
.Nx
from a
.Tn GEMDOS
partition, you need to get the
.Nx
distribution sets you wish to install
on your system on to a
.Tn GEMDOS
partition.
.Pp
Note where you placed the files, you will need this later.
.Pp
Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next
step in the installation process, preparing your hard disk.
.It Em Tape
To install
.Nx
from a tape, you need to somehow
get the
.Nx
filesets you wish to install on
your system on to the appropriate kind of tape.
If you make the tape on a
.Ul
system, you can create it as follows:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "cd .../NetBSD-\*V/\*M/binary/sets"
.Dl # Ic "T=\*[Lt]tape_device\*[Gt]"
.Dl # Ic "mt -f $T rewind"
.Dl # Ic "for f in base etc comp games man misc rescue text"
.Dl   Ic "\ \ \ \ dd if=$f.\*[setsuffix] of=$T conv=osync bs=5k"
.Dl # Ic "done"
.Dl # Ic "mt -f $T rewind"
.Pp
where
.Dq \*[Lt]tape_device\*[Gt]
is the name of the (non-rewinding!) tape
device that you're using (probably something like
.Pa /dev/nrst0 ,
but we make no guarantees 8-).
If you can't figure it out, ask your system administrator.
.Pp
Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next
step in the installation process, preparing your hard disk.
