Installing NetBSD is a relatively complex process, but, if you have
this document in hand and are careful to read and remember the
information which is presented to you by the install program, it
shouldn't be too much trouble.
.Pp
Before you begin, you must have already prepared your hard disk as
detailed in the section on preparing your system for install.
.Pp
The following is a walk-through of the steps necessary to get NetBSD
installed on your hard disk.  If you wish to stop the installation,
you may hit Control-C at any prompt, but if you do, you'll have to
begin again from scratch.
.Bl -enum
.It
Booting the miniroot
First you need to get yourself into NetBSD.  This can be
done in a couple ways, both of which currently require
GEMDOS. You need either the bootfloppy provided in the
distribution or you can copy the loadbsd.ttp program and
kernel to a boot floppy disk (1.4M needed) or put them on a TOS
partition.  Select the loadbsd program and it will
ask for parameters, supply: '-b netbsd' (or whatever name
you copied the kernel to).  You can, of course, also run it
from the shell command-line in MiNT:
.Dl loadbsd -b a:/netbsd
.Pp
You should see the screen clear and some information about
your system as the kernel configures the hardware.  Then
you will be prompted for a root device.  At this time remove
the GEMDOS kernel boot floppy from the drive if present and
insert the BSD install floppy 1.  Now type `md0a' to tell the
kernel to load the install filesystem into RAMdisk. While
While the kernel is loading, it will show a '.' for each
track loaded. After loading 80 tracks, it will ask you
to insert the next floppy. At this time, insert the BSD
install floppy 2 and hit any key. The kernel continous
loading another 40 tracks before it continues to boot.
.(tag Note:
If you are using 1.44Mb floppies, you should select 'md1a'
instead of 'md0a'.
.tag)
The system should continue to boot.  For now ignore WARNING:
messages about bad dates in clocks. Eventually you will be
be asked to enter the pathname of the shell, just hit
return.  After a short while, you will be asked to select
the type of your keyboard. After you have entered a valid
response here, the system asks you if you want to install
or upgrade your system. Since you are reading the 'install'
section, 'i' would be the proper response here...
.It
Entering the installer
The installer starts with a nice welcome message. Read this
message carefully, it also informs you of the risks involved
in continuing! If you still want to go on, type 'y'. The
installer now continues by trying to figure out your disk
configuration.  When it is done, you will be prompted to select
a root device from the list of disks it has found.
.It
Select your root device
You should know at this point that the disks are NOT numbered
according to their scsi-id! The NetBSD kernel numbers the scsi
drives (and other devices on the scsi bus) sequentially as it
finds them. The drive with the lowest scsi id will be called sd0,
the next one sd1, etc.
Where you end up after the selection of the root disk depends on
the contents of your disk. If it is already partitioned using
AHDI, start reading at item 4a, if this disk has no AHDI partitioning
but is blank or used by another non-AHDI system, start at item 4b.
.Pp
.Em You are now at the point of no return!
The programs in section
4 will modify your harddisk. Type Control-C 
.Em now
if you don't
want this.
.It
Setting AHDI partition id's on your root disk (using edahdi)
Because NetBSD imposes a special ordering in disk partitions it
uses for root and swap. And because it wants to guard you against
an unwanted demolition of partitions used by other systems, you
have to tell it what partitions it is allowed to use. You have
to mark the partition you want to use as swap 'NBS' or 'SWP'
and the other partitions as 'NBD'. Note that all the changes
you make to the id's are reversable as long as you remember the
original value.
In the partition-id editor, the partitions are shown in the order
that AHDI created them. When you leave this editor and continue
at item 4b, your changes to the id's do have consequences to the
partition order! They will show up as follows:
.Pp
.	Bl -tag -width d\ (and\ up)
.	It a          
\- the first NBD partition
.	It b          
\- the first NBS partition
.	It d\ (and\ up) 
\- the rest of the partitions in AHDI order
.	El
.It
Labeling your root disk (using edlabel)
You are now allowed to change the partitioning of your disk. If
your disk is already partitioned with AHDI DON'T change anything
unless you are absolutely sure what you are doing!
If you are labeling an empty SCSI disk, you can make life easy for
yourself by selecting 'standarize geometry'. This allows you to
select a 'sectors per track' and 'tracks/cylinder' value and have
the (fictious) SCSI geometry changed accordingly. So if you select
64 sect/track and 32 tracks/cylinder, each cylinder is exactly
1Mb in size. Well, go ahead and don't forget to save your work
before you quit!
.(tag Note:
to make sure that NetBSD can create/mount filesystems on
the partitions you defined, make sure the 'type' is entered
correctly:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 4.2BSD -compact
.It Tn 4.2BSD
\- filesystems created by NetBSD
.It Tn MSDOS
\- filesystems shared with GEM
.El
.tag)
.It
Label additional disks
Now that your root-disk is labeled, you are given the opportunity
to label any of the other disks in your system. The procedure is
the same as with your root disk.
.It
Setup the fstab
Since all disks you want to use with NetBSD are properly labeled,
it is time to tell the installer which partition will be associated
with the different filesystems. As mentioned above, it is wise to
make at least a separate root and /usr filesystem. Depending on
what you are planning to do with your system, you might also consider
to make a separate /var, /local or /home.
When you tell the installer that all of your filesystems are specified
correctly, it starts creating them for you.
.It
Configure your network
Currently none of the kernels supplied in the distribution has
network support builtin. If you compiled your own kernel, network
configuration mostly works. [ Due to space limitiations, some
of the network commands are not present on the install floppy ]
.It
Edit the fstab - again....
Since the network configuration might have lead to additional (nfs)
filesystem entries, you get another chance to modify your fstab.
.It
Installing the distribution sets
You are finally at the point where some real data will be put on
your freshly-made filesystems. Select the device type you whish
to install from and off you go....
Some notes:
.Bl -bullet
.It
If you want to install from tape, please read the section
about how to create such a tape.
The tape device name will be "nrst0" for the first tape
drive, "nrst1" for the second, etc.
.It
Install at least the base and etc sets.
.It
If you have to specify a path relative to the mount-point and
you need the mount-point itself, enter '.'.
.It
For previous NetBSD users:  If you want to install from a
GEMDOS filesystem, you don't need to rename the distribution
sets as you may have done in previous versions of NetBSD.
.El
.It
Timezone selection and device-node building
The isn't much to say about this. Just select the timezone you
are in. The installer will make the correct setup on your root
filesystem. After the timezone-link is installed, the installer
will proceed by creating the device nodes on your root filesystem.
Be patient, this will take a while...
.It
Installing the kernel
Because the kernel didn't fit on the install-disks, the installer
asks you about the disk your kernel is on. You can specify the
floppy with disk 'fd0' and partition 'b' for  720K disks and
partition 'c' for 1.4M disks, or one of the hard disk partitions.
.It
Installing the bootstrap
Finally, the installer ask you if you want to install the bootblock
code on your root disk. This is a matter of personal choise and can
also be done from a running NetBSD system. See the 'installboot(8)'
manual page about how to do this.
.It
You did it!
Congratulations, you just installed NetBSD successfully! If you
also installed a bootblock, you only have to reboot your atari to
enter your freshly build system. If you didn't, get back to section
1 (How to boot the miniroot). Just substitute 'md0a' by your NetBSD
root disk.
.El
.Ss2 Some\ Extra\ Remarks
If you don't want to use the bootloader. You could use the following
setup:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Reserve a small GEMDOS partition of about 4Mb. This is
enough to put in a few kernels. Put the netbsd kernel
into this partition. Also, edit your /etc/fstab to always
mount this partition, say as /kernels. Now make a symlink
from /netbsd to /kernels/netbsd.
This sceme is particulary handy when you want to make your
own kernel. When compilation is finished, you just copy
your kernel to /kernels/netbsd and reboot. It's wise to
make sure there is _always_ a 'known to work' kernel image
present.
