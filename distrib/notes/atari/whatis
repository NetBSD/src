The Atari release stepped in in March 1995. The first official release was
.Nx 1.1 .
About a year later, 
.Nx 1.2
was released for the Atari. This
release fixed a large number of bugs and made the Atari-port a stable member
of the NetBSD family.
The saga continued with the
.Nx 1.3
release. In this release, support was added for the Medusa Hades, Riebl
ethernet and Falcon IDE support.
And now, yet another release is emerging!
