.Ss2 Binary distribution sets
.\"
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.\" XXX: most sets except kern and xserver should be in notes/common
.\"
The
.Nx
\*M
binary distribution sets contain the binaries which
comprise the
.Nx
\*V release for \*M.
The binary distribution sets can be found in the
.Pa \*M/binary/sets
subdirectory
of the
.Nx
\*V
distribution tree, and are as follows:
.(tag xserver \" sets
.
.It Sy base
The
.Nx
\*V
\*M
.Sy base
binary distribution.
You
.Em must
install this distribution set.
It contains the base
.Nx
utilities that are necessary for the
system to run and be minimally functional.
.
.It Sy comp
Things needed for compiling programs.
This set includes the system include files
.Pq Pa /usr/include
and the various system libraries (except the shared
libraries, which are included as part of the
.Sy base
set).
This set also includes the manual pages for
all of the utilities it contains, as well as the
system call and library manual pages.
.
.It Sy debug
This distribution set contains debug information for
all base system utilities.
It is useful when reporting issues with binaries or during
developement.
This set is huge, if the target disk is small, do not install it.
.
.It Sy etc
This distribution set contains the system
configuration files that reside in
.Pa /etc
and in several other places.
This set
.Em must
be installed if you are installing the system from scratch, but should
.Em not
be used if you are upgrading.
.
.It Sy games
This set includes the games and their manual pages.
.
.\" MD kernel set(s) -------------------------------------------------
.
.It Sy kern-SMALL030, kern-ATARITT, kern-FALCON, kern-HADES , kern-MILAN-ISAIDE , kern-MILAN-PCIIDE
These sets contain a
.Nx*M
\*V
kernel, named
.Pa /netbsd .
You
.Em must
install the kernel that matches your hardware.
.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.
.It Sy man
This set includes all of the manual pages for the
binaries and other software contained in the
.Sy base
set.
Note that it does not include any of the manual pages
that are included in the other sets.
.
.It Sy misc
This set includes the system dictionaries,
the typesettable document set, and other files from
.Pa /usr/share .
.
.It Sy modules
This set includes kernel modules to add functionality to a running system.
.
.It Sy rescue
This set includes the statically linked emergency recover binaries installed
in
.Pa /rescue .
.
.It Sy text
This set includes
.Nx Ns 's
text processing tools, including
.Xr groff 1 ,
all related programs, and their manual pages.
.
.tag) \" sets
.
.
.\" X sets -----------------------------------------------------------
.\" XXX: XOrg vs XFree
.\" XXX: ports without xserver
.Pp
.Nx
maintains its own set of sources for the X Window System in order to
assure tight integration and compatibility.
These sources are based on
X.Org.
Binary sets for the X Window System are distributed with
.Nx .
The sets are:
.(tag xserver \" x sets
.
.It Sy xbase
The basic files needed for a complete X
client environment.
This does not include the X servers.
.
.It Sy xcomp
The extra libraries and include files needed to compile X source code.
.
.It Sy xdebug
This distribution set contains debug information for
all X11 binaries.
It is useful when reporting issues with these binaries or during
developement.
This set is huge, if the target disk is small, do not install it.
.
.It Sy xfont
Fonts needed by the X server and by X clients.
.
.It Sy xetc
Configuration files for X which could be locally modified.
.
.It Sy xserver
The X server.
.

.
.\" MI DISCUSSION OF BINARY SETS -------------------------------------
.\" XXX: should be in notes/common
.
.Pp
The \*M binary distribution sets are distributed as gzipped tar files
named with the extension
.Sy .\*[setsuffix] ,
e.g.
.Pa base.\*[setsuffix] .
.
.
.Pp
The instructions given for extracting the source sets work equally
well for the binary sets, but it is worth noting that if you use that
method, the filenames stored in the sets are relative and therefore
the files are extracted
.Em below the current directory .
Therefore, if you want to extract the binaries into your system, i.e.
replace the system binaries with them, you have to run the
.Ic "tar -xzpf"
command from the root directory (
.Pa /
) of your system.
.
.
.\" MD DISCUSSION ----------------------------------------------------
.
.Pp
Additional kernels to those included in the distribution sets may be found
in the
.Pa atari/binary/kernel
subdirectory of the
.Nx
\*V distribution tree.
These kernels are generally named something like
.Pa netbsd-BOOT.gz
or some other suitable name.
Please note that these kernels are simply gzipped and are not in tar archives.
.Pp
There are six atari floppy images to be found in the
.Pa atari/installation/floppies
subdirectory of the
.Nx
\*V distribution.
Three of them are bootable
.Tn TOS
kernel floppies and the other
three are installation floppies.
They are described in more detail below.
There are gzipped versions of each available, for easier downloading.
(The gzipped versions have the
.Pa \&.gz
extension added to their names.)
.(tag indent \" atari
.It Em Bootable\ Kernel\ floppies
These
.Tn TOS
disks contains the
.Tn TOS
support programs (like
.Ic loadbsd.ttp
and
.Ic chg_pid.ttp
\(em see below) and a kernel.
They are setup such that you can insert them into
your floppy drive, and start the programs from GEM.
.Pp
For the TT030 and Falcon, the (720 KB) floppy is named
.Pa boot.fs
and
the kernel supplied is
.Li BOOT .
For the Hades, you need the
.Pa hades-boot.fs
floppy (1.44 MB), the kernel is
.Li HADES .
For the Milan, you need the
.Pa milan-boot.fs
floppy (1.44 MB), the kernel is MILAN-PCIIDE.
.It Em Installation\ floppy:
This disk contains a
.Bx
root file system setup to help
you install the rest of
.Nx .
This includes formatting
and mounting your
.Pa /
(root) and
.Pa /usr
partitions and getting
ready to extract (and possibly first fetching) the distribution
sets.
There is enough on this file system to allow you to
make a slip connection, configure an ethernet, mount an NFS
file system or ftp.
You can also load distribution sets from a SCSI tape or from one of
your existing
.Tn GEMDOS
partitions.
.Pp
The floppies meant for 720 KB disks are named
.Pa miniroot.fs.1
and
.Pa miniroot.fs.2 .
There is also an image for an 1.44 MB disk:
.Pa miniroot.fs .
.tag) \" atari
.Pp
There are also
.Tn TOS
utilities in the
.Pa atari/installation/misc
subdirectory, which you will need to get
.Nx*M
up-and-running.
.(bullet
The
.Ic gzip.ttp
program allows you to uncompress .gz images.
The usage is:
.Pp
.Dl Ic "gzip.ttp -d filename.gz"
.It
The
.Ic rawwrite.ttp
program allows you to create the installation
floppy disks from the files in the
.Pa atari/floppies
directory.
.It
The
.Ic aptck.ttp
program reads the partition tables present on a
given disk and tries to interpret then the same way the
.Nx
kernel does.
If you have a disk on which
.Tn GEMDOS
and
.Nx
are to co-exist, It is a good idea to run this before you begin the
.Nx*M
installation just to check that the kernel's view
of the partition tables agree with
.Tn GEMDOS Ns 's
view.
If you have more than 3 partitions defined on a disk you will notice that the
.Nx*M
partition starts one sector after the
.Tn GEMDOS
partition.
This is to allow space for the auxiliary root for
the 4th and subsequent partitions.
.It
The
.Ic loadbsd.ttp
program loads the
.Nx*M
kernel from
.Tn TOS
(or
.Tn MiNT ,
.Tn MultiTOS ,
etc.).
.It
The
.Ic chg_pid.ttp
program can be used to change the id of an
.Tn AHDI
compatible partition.
This allows you to reserve a partition for use by
.Nx*M
(id: NBD), or for use as a swap (id: SWP) partition.
.It
The
.Ic file2swp.ttp
program can be used to transfer an installation file system image, like
.Pa sysinst.fs
to a partition with id SWP.
In this way, you can run the installation from the swap partition
instead of a memory disk.
This is a necessity for small memory systems.
