.\"============================ MI DISCUSSION OF BINARY SETS
.
.Pp
The \*m binary distribution sets are distributed as gzipped tar files
named with the extension
.Sy .tgz , No e.g.
.Pa base.tgz .
.
.
.\" contrary to most old INSTALL docs, only i386 has Split/ sets
.
.
.
.Pp
The instructions given for extracting the source sets work equally
well for the binary sets, but it is worth noting that if you use that
method, the files are /-relative and
therefore are extracted
.Em below
the current directory. That
is, if you want to extract the binaries into your system, i.e.
replace the system binaries with them, you have to run the
.Ic tar xfp
command from /.
.
.
.
.
.Pp
Additional kernels to those included in the distribution sets may be found
in the
.Pa atari/binary/kernel
subdirectory of the
.Nx \*V
distribution tree. These kernels are generally named something like
.Pa netbsd.BOOT.gz
or some other suitable name. Please note that these kernels are simply
gzipped and are not in tar archives.
.Pp
There are three atari floppy images to be found in the
.Pa atari/installation/floppies
subdirectory of the
.Nx \*V
distribution. One of them is a bootable TOS kernel floppy and the other
two are installation floppies. They are described in more detail below.
There are gzipped versions of each available, for easier downloading.
(The gzipped versions have the
.Pa \&.gz
extension added to their names.)
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Em Bootable\ Kernel\ floppy
This TOS disk contains the loadbsd and chg_pid programs
and a kernel. It is setup so that you can insert it
int your floppy drive, and start the programs from GEM.
.Pp
For the TT030 and Falcon, the (720KB) floppy is named boot.fs and
the kernel supplied is 'BOOT'. For the Hades, you need the
hades-boot.fs floppy (1.44MB), the kernel is 'HADES'.
.It Em Installation\ floppy:
This disk contains a BSD root file system setup to help
you install the rest of NetBSD. This includes formatting
and mounting your root and /usr partitions and getting
ready to extract (and possibly first fetching) the distribution
sets. There is enough on this file system to allow you to
make a slip connection, configure an ethernet, mount an NFS
file system or ftp. You can also load distribution sets from
a SCSI tape or from one of your existing GEMDOS partitions.
.Pp
The floppies meant for 720KB disks are named
.Pa miniroot.fs.1 No and Pa miniroot.fs.2 .
There is also an image for an 1.44MB disk:
.Pa miniroot.fs .
.El
.Pp
There are also TOS utilities in the
.Pa atari/installation/misc
subdirectory, which you will need to get NetBSD/Atari 'up-and-running'.
.Bl -bullet
.It
The
.Dq gzip.ttp
program allows you to uncompress .gz images. The
usage is "gzip.ttp -d filename.gz".
.It
The
.Dq rawwrite.ttp
program allows you to create the installation
floppy disks from the files in the
.Pa atari/floppies
directory.
.It
The "aptck.ttp" program reads the partition tables present on a
given disk and tries to interpret then the same way the NetBSD
kernel does. If you have a disk on which GEMDOS and
.Nx
are to co-exist, It is a good idea to run this before you begin the
NetBSD/Atari installation just to check that the kernel's view
of the partition tables agree with GEMDOS's view. If you have
more than 3 partitions defined on a disk you will notice that
the NetBSD/\*m partition starts one sector after the GEMDOS
partition. This is to allow space for the auxilliary root for
the 4th and subsequent partitions.
.It
The "loadbsd.ttp" program loads the NetBSD/\*m kernel from TOS
(or MiNT, MultiTOS, etc.).
