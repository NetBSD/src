.\" ---------- MD instructions on setting up boot media
.
.(Note
.Nx*M
\*V
does not support any framebuffers (yet) so
you have to use serial console on installation procedure.
.Note)
.Pp
You will need to have
a 1.44 MB floppy disk
to boot off.
You must put the boot floppy image onto this disk, which contains
software to install
.Nx
system.
.Pp
If you are using a
.Ul
system (such as
.Tn NEWS-OS
or other
.Nx
machines) to write the floppy images to disks, you should use the
.Xr dd 1
command to copy the file system image(s)
(.fs file(s)) directly to the raw floppy disk.
.Pp
If you have an i386 machine which runs
.Tn Microsoft Windows
and use it to write the floppy image(s) to floppy disk, you can use the
.Ic Rawrite32
Windows program.
It can be downloaded from
.Lk https://www.NetBSD.org/~martin/rawrite32 .
.Ic rawrite
utility for the
.Tn MS-DOS
environment is also available in the
.Pa i386/installation/misc/
directory of i386 install media.
.Pp
Though
.Nx*M
uses the floppy disk to boot for the initial
installation, the
.Nx*M
kernel does not support the
floppy device.
Some other machines or systems are still required to write floppy images
even after
.Nx*M
has been installed.
.Pp
If your machine doesn't have any SCSI disks, or the SCSI interface
on your machine is not supported, it can still run
.Nx*M
diskless.
No file transfer is needed, and all you have to do is to prepare files on
the server.
More information about diskless setups can be found at
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/docs/network/netboot/
.Pp
The
.Tn NEWS
PROM also supports tape boot and network boot, but
.Nx*M
does not support them currently.
.Pp
After the boot floppy is prepared, just type
.Ic "bo fh"
on the PROM prompt to boot it.
