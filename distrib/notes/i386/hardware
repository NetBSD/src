.Nx \*V
runs on ISA (AT-Bus), EISA, MCA, PCI, and VL-bus systems
with 386-family processors, with or without math coprocessors.
The minimal configuration is said to require 4 MB of RAM and 50 MB of disk
space, though we do not know of anyone running with a system quite
this minimal today.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space
(the unpacked binary distribution, without sources,
requires at least 65 MB without counting space needed for swap space,
etc), and to run X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.
(4 MB of RAM will actually allow you to run X and/or compile, but it
won't be speedy.
Note that until you have around 16 MB of RAM, getting
more RAM is more important than getting a faster CPU.)
