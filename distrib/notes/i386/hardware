.Nx \*V
runs on ISA (AT-Bus), EISA, PCI, and VL-bus systems
with 386-family processors, with or without math coprocessors. It
does NOT support MCA systems, such as some IBM PS/2 systems. The
minimal configuration is said to require 4M of RAM and 50M of disk
space, though we do not know of anyone running with a system quite
this minimal today. To install the entire system requires much more
disk space (the unpacked binary distribution, without sources,
requires at least 65M without counting space needed for swap space,
etc), and to run X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.
(4M of RAM will actually allow you to run X and/or compile, but it
won't be speedy. Note that until you have around 16M of RAM, getting
more RAM is more important than getting a faster CPU.)

Supported devices include:
.Bd -literal
	Floppy controllers.
	MFM, ESDI, IDE, and RLL hard disk controllers.
		There is complete support (including IDE DMA or Ultra-
		DMA) for the following PCI controllers:
                -  Acer labs M5229 IDE Controller
                -  CMD Tech PCI0643, 0646, 0648 and 0649 IDE Controllers
                -  Contaq Microsystems/Cypress CY82C693 IDE Controller
                -  HighPoint HPT366 IDE Controller
                -  Intel PIIX, PIIX3 and PIIX4 IDE Controllers
                -  Intel 82801 (ICH/ICH0) IDE Controllers
		-  Promise PDC20246 (Ultra/33) and PDC20262 (Ultra/66) 
                -  Silicon Integrated System 5597/5598 IDE controller
                -  VIA Technologies VT82C586 and VT82C586A IDE Controllers
                Most of these controllers are only available in
		multifunction PCI chips. 
		Other PCI IDE controllers are supported, but
		performances may not be optimal.
		ISA, ISA plug and play and PCMCIA IDE controllers
		are supported as well.

.Ed
.Pp
Drivers for hardware marked with "[*]" are NOT present in kernels on the
distribution floppies.  Except as noted above, all drivers are present
on all disks.  Also, at the present time, the distributed kernels
support only one SCSI host adapter per machine. 
.Nx
normally
allows more, though, so if you have more than one, you can use all of
them by compiling a custom kernel once
.Nx
is installed.
.Pp
Support for devices marked with "[+]" IS included in the "generic" kernels,
although it is not in the kernels which are on the distribution floppies.
.Pp
Support for devices marked with "[b]" requires BIOS support for PCI-PCI
bridging on your motherboard.  Most reasonably modern Pentium motherboards
have this support, or can acquire it via a BIOS upgrade.
.Pp
Hardware the we do NOT currently support, but get many questions
about:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Multiprocessor systems. (NetBSD will run, but only use one processor.)
.It
PCI WD-7000 SCSI host adapters.
.It
QIC-40 and QIC-80 tape drives.
(Drives that connect to the floppy disk controller.)
.El
.Pp
We are planning future support for many of these devices.
.Pp
To be detected by the distributed kernels, the devices must
be configured as follows:
