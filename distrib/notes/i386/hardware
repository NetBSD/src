.Nx \*V
runs on ISA (AT-Bus), EISA, PCI, and VL-bus systems
with 386-family processors, with or without math coprocessors. It
does NOT support MCA systems, such as some IBM PS/2 systems. The
minimal configuration is said to require 4M of RAM and 50M of disk
space, though we do not know of anyone running with a system quite
this minimal today. To install the entire system requires much more
disk space (the unpacked binary distribution, without sources,
requires at least 65M without counting space needed for swap space,
etc), and to run X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.
(4M of RAM will actually allow you to run X and/or compile, but it
won't be speedy. Note that until you have around 16M of RAM, getting
more RAM is more important than getting a faster CPU.)

Supported devices include:
.Bd -literal
	Floppy controllers.
	MFM, ESDI, IDE, and RLL hard disk controllers.
		bus-master DMA is supported for the Intel PIIX, CMD Tech
		PCI0643 and PCI0646, and VIA Apollo (VT82C586 and VT82C586A/B)
		series of pci ide controllers.

			that you cannot boot from these boards if they
			do not have a boot ROM; only the AHA-152x and
			motherboards using this chip are likely to be
			bootable, consequently.)

.Pp
Drivers for hardware marked with "[*]" are NOT present in kernels on the
distribution floppies.  Except as noted above, all drivers are present
on all disks.  Also, at the present time, the distributed kernels
support only one SCSI host adapter per machine. 
.Nx
normally
allows more, though, so if you have more than one, you can use all of
them by compiling a custom kernel once
.Nx
is installed.
.Pp
Support for devices marked with "[+]" IS included in the "generic" kernels,
although it is not in the kernels which are on the distribution floppies.
.Pp
Support for devices marked with "[b]" requires BIOS support for PCI-PCI
bridging on your motherboard.  Most reasonably modern Pentium motherboards
have this support, or can acquire it via a BIOS upgrade.
.Pp
Hardware the we do NOT currently support, but get many questions
about:
.Bl -bullet
.It
AMD PCscsi SCSI host adapters (though the PCnet portion of the PCnet-SCSI works fine)
.It
Multiprocessor Pentium and Pentium Pro systems. (Though they should run fine using one processor only.)
.It
NCR 5380-based SCSI host adapters.
.It
PCI WD-7000 SCSI host adapters.
.It
QIC-40 and QIC-80 tape drives.
(Drives that connect to the floppy disk controller.)
.El
.Pp
We are planning future support for many of these devices.
.Pp
To be detected by the distributed kernels, the devices must
be configured as follows:
