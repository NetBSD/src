.\" ---------- MD instructions on setting up boot media
.
If you are not booting off a CD-ROM, you will need to have some floppy
disks to boot off;
either three 1.44 MB floppies or one 1.2 MB floppy.
.Pp
Use
.Pa boot1.fs
and
.Pa boot2.fs
for VGA installation.
.Pa boot-com1.fs
and 
.Pa boot-com2.fs
are available if you wish to use a serial console.
.Pp
If you are using a
.Ul
system to write the floppy images to
disks, you should use the
.Xr dd
command to copy the file system image(s)
(.fs file) directly to the raw floppy disk.
It is suggested that you read the
.Xr dd 1
manual page or ask your system administrator to determine the correct
set of arguments to use; it will be slightly different from system to
system, and a comprehensive list of the possibilities is beyond the
scope of this document.
.Pp
If you are using
.Tn Microsoft Windows
to write the floppy image(s) to floppy disk, you can use the
.Ic Rawrite32
Windows program.
It can be downloaded from
.Lk https://www.NetBSD.org/~martin/rawrite32 .
A
.Ic rawrite
utility for the
.Tn MS-DOS
environment is also available in the
.Pa i386/installation/misc/
directory of the i386 install media.
