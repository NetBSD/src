i386-specific enhancements include a number of new device drivers, such
as the Intel Etherexpress FE drivers, ATAPI support, and others.
See the hardware compatibility list for supported devices.

Other (but not all) i386-specific improvements are:
	* APM support
	* bounce-buffer support so that busmaster ISA controllers
	  work for machines with > 16M
	* floppy formatting support
	* improved detection of the amount of memory present in the
	  machine
	* support for FAT32 filesystems

NetBSD 1.3 on i386 is, as usual, also fully backward compatible with old
NetBSD i386 binaries, so you don't need to recompile all your local programs.
