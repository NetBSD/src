The
.Sq standard
method of getting
.Nx*M
onto your \*M is
via the console terminal and using the downloading parts of the
ROM monitor.
As such, usually another computer has the distribution
on disk and is connected via a serial line to your \*M's console port.
A terminal connected to the attached host computer is used
to access the \*M console via a terminal program.
The source for a program called download is part of this distribution.
Download sends data to the ROM monitor over the serial line.

You may need to find and read the documentation about the ROM monitor
download command and other low level commands.
.Pp
Other methods of getting
.Nx*M
on your \*M may include
SCSI tape or SCSI floppy disk or cloning a disk on a system
already running
.Nx*M .
.Pp
If you have some operating system already running on your \*M,
you can use that OS to get
.Nx*M
on a hard disk much easier than
with the ROM monitor.
.Nx*M
was developed from Minix/\*M
until it was self hosting.
You can run
.Nx
and Minix or other OS off the same disk.
