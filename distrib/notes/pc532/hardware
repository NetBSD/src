.Nx*M
\*V runs on a
.Tn PC532
computer.
It supports a subset of the
.Dq standard
hardware to date.
This is defined as:
.(bullet -offset indent
4 MB of memory
.It
8 serial lines done by 4 scn2681 chips
.It
The NCR DP8490 SCSI chip (SCSI only)
.(bullet -compact
Most SCSI disks work (fixed and floppy)
.It
A few SCSI tapes work
.It
Some SCSI CD-ROM drives work
.bullet)
.It
The Matthias Pfaller Parallel Port.

.Nx*M
currently expects the ROM monitor to be the
.Dq autoboot monitor
of Oct/Nov 1991.
It includes support to set up auto booting of
.Nx ,
including a secondary boot program that the autoboot monitor
will load that in turn loads the
.Nx
kernel from a
.Nx
file system.
Source and ROM images of the autoboot monitor are located at
.Lk ftp://ftp.cs.wwu.edu/pub/\*M/mon.auto.tar.gz
.Pp
Most of the \*M specific development of
.Nx*M
was done on a machine with 8 MB of memory.
It should run with 4 MB of memory although it may be slower.
