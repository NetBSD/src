This is the second major release of
.Nx
for the \*M platform, including the Apple iBook, iMac, PowerMacintosh, and
PowerBook models, as well as clones.
.Pp
As is usual between releases, the \*M port has had many improvements
made to it - too many to detail all of them here.
.Pp
Numerous new drivers have been added.
See the supported hardware list for details.
.Pp
Some (but not all!) notable \*M-specific improvements include:
.(bullet
A simpler install procedure for models released after 1996, which have
Open Firmware version 3 and only one hard drive.  The procedure described
in this document will no longer render your drive unbootable on these models.
.It
Migration to the ELF binary format from a.out.
You can still use your pre-1.5 a.out applications, though.
.It
Support for the latest laptop models which previously required a special
ADB keyboard patch (the iBook, iBook SE, iBook (Dual USB), PowerBook
(FireWire), and the PowerBook G4 (Titanium)).
.It
Support for the latest iMac machines, the iMac (Early 2001).
.bullet)
.Pp
.Nx \*V
on \*M is, as usual, also fully backward compatible with old
.Nx*M
binaries, so you don't need to recompile all your local programs
provided you set the appropriate binary compatibility options in your
kernel configuration.
