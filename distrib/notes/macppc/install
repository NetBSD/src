.Ss2 Open Firmware boot syntax
.
The syntax of the Open Firmware
.Ic boot
command is:
.Pp
.Dl boot boot-device [boot-file] [-as]
.Pp
where the
.Li boot-device
describes where to find the bootloader,
.Li boot-file
describes where to find the
.Nx
kernel, and the options specify how you want to boot.
.Pp
You use the
.Li boot-device
to tell Open Firmware where to find
.Xr ofwboot 8
by listing the device, the partition (if it's a disk), and the filename
of the bootloader (if using
.Pa ofwboot.xcf ) .
.Pp
If the
.Li boot-file
is on the same device and partition (if it's a disk) as the
.Li boot-device
then you can just specify the kernel filename.
Otherwise, you need to specify the full Open Firmware path to the kernel.
.Pp
The
.Fl a
flag will ask you for the location of the next item to load
(i.e. the bootloader will ask where the kernel is (if unspecified),
or the kernel will ask where the root file system is).
The
.Fl s
flag will boot into
.Sq single-user
mode.
.Pp
The exact command you will be using depends on which version of Open Firmware
your machine has and which device you will be booting from.
Sometimes you may have to guess as we don't know all of the combinations
of models, device names, and file names.
In general the format is:
.Li "device:[partition][,\efilename]" .
Keep in mind for the future that you may be able to have your
.Li boot-device
and
.Li boot-file
on entirely different devices (such as the bootloader netbooted from
.Li enet
and the kernel loaded from a hard drive on the
.Li ultra0
ATA/IDE bus).
.Pp
We'll try to walk you through the process of figuring out what Open
Firmware calls your device, partition, and file names.
To start with, Open Firmware keeps a
.Dq device tree
with all of the devices it finds in your system.
You can get a listing of the nodes in this device tree with the
.Ic dev
and
.Ic ls
commands.
.Ic dev
is similar to the unix
.Ic cd
command and is used to change between the nodes in the Open Firmware
device tree (similar to a file system).
.Ic ls
of course is similar to the unix
.Ic ls
command and is used to list the contents of the current device node.
To get a listing of all the devices available in your system, use the
following commands:
.(disp
.No 0 \*> Ic "dev /"
.No 0 \*> Ic "ls"
.disp)
.Pp
Open Firmware has device aliases which are simple names for the full
hardware path to a device (similar to
.Ic alias
in
.Xr csh 1 ).
You can find out
what device aliases Apple created on your machine with the
.Ic devalias
command.
For example, here are the devaliases on a PowerMacintosh 7300:
.Pp
.(disp
.No 0 \*> Ic devalias
vci0                /chaos@F0000000
pci1                /bandit@F2000000
pci2                /bandit@F4000000
fd                  /bandit/gc/swim3
kbd                 /bandit/gc/via-cuda/adb/keyboard
ttya                /bandit/gc/escc/ch-a
ttyb                /bandit/gc/escc/ch-b
enet                /bandit/gc/mace
scsi                /bandit/gc/53c94
scsi-int            /bandit/gc/mesh
 ok
.disp)
.Pp
On most systems, you'll find the devices you're looking for.
Typical aliases are:
.Bl -column xxx "scsi-intxxxxxx" "internal scsi bus (on system with multiple SCSI busses)"
.It Ta Dl hd Ta No "internal hard drive"
.It Ta Dl cd Ta No "CD-ROM drive"
.It Ta Dl zip Ta No "internal Zip drive"
.It Ta Dl enet Ta No ethernet
.It Ta Dl fd Ta No "floppy drive"
.It Ta Dl scsi Ta No "SCSI bus"
.It Ta Dl scsi-int Ta No "internal SCSI bus (on systems with multiple SCSI busses)"
.It Ta Dl ata Ta No "ATA/IDE bus"
.It Ta Dl ideN Ta No "ATA/IDE bus number N"
.It Ta Dl ultraN Ta No "Ultra/66 or Ultra/100 IDE bus number N"
.El
.Pp
Note that some of these items are the device itself, and some are a bus.
When you only have the devalias to a bus, you need to specify which
device on that bus you want to use.
You can use the Open Firmware
.Ic dev No and Ic ls
commands.
For example, here are the devices on the internal SCSI bus of a
PowerMacintosh 7300:
.(disp
.No 0 \*> Ic "dev scsi-int"
.No 0 \*> Ic "ls"
FF83C850: /sd@0,0
FF83D480: /st@0,0
 ok
.disp)
.Pp
In this case, Open Firmware seems to be saying there are two devices, both
at address zero (one is a SCSI disk
.Sq sd@0,0
and the other is a SCSI tape
.Sq st@0,0 ).
Unfortunately, older systems will only list the naming convention and not
the actual devices currently connected, but that's OK -- we've got more
tricks up our sleeve.
.Pp
If you've got ATA/IDE drives, you have all the device information you need
(since Apple only ever ships drives as
.Dq master
which is typically something like
.Li ata-disk@0 , Li ATA-Disk@0 , Li atapi-disk , or Li disk@0 ).
.Pp
You can find out the devices on your SCSI bus with the
.Ic show-children
command:
.(disp
.No 0 \*> Ic "dev scsi-int"
.No 0 \*> Ic "show-children"
Target 0
  Unit 0  Disk     IBM     DCAS-32160      S65A
Target 3
  Unit 0  Removable Read Only device    SONY    CD-ROM CDU-8005 1.0j
 ok
.disp)
.Pp
Open Firmware calls SCSI IDs
.Dq Li Target .
The
.Dq Li Unit
number is the Logical Unit Number (LUN).
This is almost always zero.
Thus, this PowerMacintosh system has an IBM hard drive (DCAS-32160) at
SCSI ID 0, and a Sony CD-ROM drive (CDU-8005) at SCSI ID 3.
.Pp
Now, we've got enough information to construct the device name for
Open Firmware.
Just stick everything together to describe to Open Firmware what you want.
For example, Open Firmware calls the CD-ROM drive
in this system
.Li scsi-int/sd@3 .
.Pp
To determine if a device is bootable, type:
.Pp
.(disp
.No 0 \*> Ic dev scsi-int/sd@3
.No 0 \*> Ic words
load          write        read          seek        close     open
write-blocks  read-blocks  max-transfer  block-size  dma-sync  dma-map-out
dma-map-in    dma-free     dma-alloc
 ok
.disp)
.Pp
If the
.Ic word Li Dq open
is present in the list, then the device is almost certainly bootable.
.Pp
Next, you need to figure out what partition Open Firmware thinks your
bootloader is located on if you're going to boot from a disk.
If you're using a
.Dq "partition zero"
bootloader, the answer is obvious: 0.
Thus, your
.Li boot-device
for the
.Nx*M
CD-R image on an Open Firmware 1.0.5 system would be
.Li scsi-int/sd@3:0
since the image has a
.Sq "partition zero"
bootloader.
.Pp
Other situations get a little
trickier, as we know of no way to get a partition map from
within Open Firmware, and it uses a different numbering scheme than either
.Nx
or MacOS 9 (or earlier).  You can use
.Ic pdisk
to get a listing of the partitions on a disk.
See the Partitioning HOW-TO for help:
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/ports/macppc/partitioning.html#pdisk
.Pp
Typically, MS-DOS and ISO9660 formatted disks have their file systems at
partition 1.
Typically, Drive Setup formatted disks have their
file systems starting at partition number 9.
Often, if you omit the partition number, Open Firmware
looks in the first partition it understands holding a valid file system.
.Pp
Open Firmware uses a comma (,) to separate the partition number from the
filename.
It uses a backslash (the
.Pa \e
character) to separate directories.
The bootloader uses forward slashes (the
.Pa /
character) to separate directories when specifying the
.Li boot-file .
Thus, to specify the top of the
file system on a CD-ROM in the example PowerMacintosh 7300 system, you'd
use:
.Li scsi-int/sd@3:,\e
.Pp
Now, to confirm that you and Open Firmware are looking at the same files,
you can get a directory listing of the file system on your device with the
.Ic dir
command.
This command is only useful with file systems that Open Firmware
understands and is able to boot from.
On Open Firmware 1.0.5, 1.1.22, and 2.0.x systems, you can use
.Ic dir
on ISO9660 (not hybrid) and MS-DOS file systems.
On Open Firmware 2.4, you can use it on HFS, HFS+, hybrid, ISO9960,
and MS-DOS file systems.
On Open Firmware 3, you can use it on HFS, HFS+, hybrid (not pure ISO9660),
and MS-DOS file systems.  The one exception to this rule is that Open 
Firmware cannot list files on a disk with a 
.Sq "partition zero"
bootloader (including the 
.Nx*M
CD-R image and installation floppies).
.(disp
.No 0 \*> Ic "dir fd:,\e"
FINDER  .DAT 022 2 2B8
DESKTOP .    022 0 0
RESOURCE.FRK 012 3 0
NETBSD~1.GZ  020 5 1FDFCA
TRASH   .    010 B00 0
OFWBOOT .XCF 020 A75 D8F4
 ok
.disp)
You can see that this MS-DOS
formatted disk has a bunch of stuff, as well as the two important files:
.Pa NETBSD~1.GZ No and Pa OFWBOOT.XCF .
Note that
.Tn MacOS
shortened
.Pa netbsd-GENERIC_MD.gz No to Pa NETBSD~1.GZ
since MS-DOS file systems can only natively hold 8 characters for the
filename.
.(Note
Keep in mind that Open Firmware is often case-sensitive when it
comes to filenames.
.Note)
.(Note
You may need to append a 
.Pa ;1
to the filename when using a ISO 9660 file system.  This
.Dq "version number"
is part of the ISO 9660 specification and will show up in the directory 
listing if it is present on the disk.  For example:
.(disp
.No 0 \*> Ic "boot cd:,\eOFWBOOT.XCF;1 NETBSD.MACPPC;1"
.disp)
.Note)
.Pp
If the
.Ic dir
command showed you the files you're looking for, then you've figure out
how to tell Open Firmware to look for your bootloader!
In this case, your
.Sq Li boot-device
is
.Sq Li fd:,\eOFWBOOT.XCF
and your
.Sq Li boot-file
is
.Sq Li fd:,/NETBSD~1.GZ .

.br
(Open Firmware 1.0.5, Open Firmware 1.1.22, Open Firmware 2.0.x, Open

.Pp
The first floppy disk has a
.Sq "partition zero"
bootloader.  When it has loaded the kernel, it will ask you to insert the
second floppy disk.
.(Note
This is not a normal
.Tn MacOS
boot floppy -- you must enter Open Firmware and type a boot command.
.Note)
All you need to do is:
.Pp
.(disp
.No 0 \*> Ic boot fd:0
.disp)
.Pp
It is common to see
.Dq "READ TIMEOUT@"
from the floppy.  This means that Open
Firmware is having difficulty reading the media.  See the section below on
.Sx "Common Problems and Error Messages"
for more information about this and what you can do to get a successful boot.
.Pp
You can eject a floppy by typing:
.Pp
.(disp
.No 0 \*> Ic eject fd
.disp)
.It
.To 2 "Booting an IDE or SCSI drive with an HFS partition"
.Em "Booting an IDE or SCSI drive with an HFS or HFS+ partition"
.br
(Open Firmware 2.4, Open Firmware 3)
.Pp
.Tn MacOS
drives have several system-level partitions reserved for
.Tn MacOS
drivers.
You may find that your first HFS or HFS+ partition might be as high as
partition 9.
You may need to keep trying higher partition numbers until you find the one
that has your bootloader.  You can use
.Ic pdisk
to print out your partition map:
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/ports/macppc/partitioning.html#pdisk
.Pp
You should use the Open Firmware
.Ic dir
command to get a directory listing of the files on your hard drive.
.Pp
If bootloader is on a different partition from the
.Nx
kernel, you will need to specify where to find the kernel.
.Pp
Remember, that SCSI Zip disks are usually ID 5 or 6.
Internal hard drives are usually SCSI ID 0.
.Pp
Here are some examples of what you might use to boot the installer kernel
located on an HFS or HFS+ partition:
.Pp
.(disp
.No 0 \*> Ic "boot hd:9,\eofwboot.xcf netbsd-GENERIC_MD.gz"
.No 0 \*> Ic "boot scsi/sd@0:9,\eofwboot.xcf netbsd-GENERIC_MD.gz"

.disp)
.Pp
.It
.To 2 "Booting a custom CD-ROM"
.Em "Booting a custom CD-ROM"
.br
(All Open Firmware versions)
.Pp
Open Firmware doesn't understand long filenames (created with the RockRidge
and Joliet extensions), so you may need to figure out what your file is
called.  You should use the Open Firmware
.Ic dir
command to get a listing of the files on your CD.
.Pp
For instance,
.Ic Toast
for
.Tn MacOS
creates CDs with long filenames, but uses
.Tn MS-DOS
style short names
as well.
Instead of referencing
.Pa netbsd-GENERIC
you would need to open
.Pa NETBSD-G.ENE
The
.Ic mkisofs
program has a similar problem,
.Pa netbsd-GENERIC_MD.gz
becomes
.Pa NETBSD-GENERIC_MD.GZ .
.Pp
Another thing to note is that you
.Em must
use the same case when specifying the filename to load that Open Firmware
uses.
Also, keep in mind what format your CD-R has to be for your version of
Open Firmware (pure ISO versus hybrid ISO/HFS).
.Pp
We'll assume that you've wisely renamed your kernel to
.Pa netbsd.gz
to avoid many of these name issues.
Here are some examples of what you might use to boot from CD-ROM
(Apple usually sets their CD-ROM drives to SCSI ID 3):
.Pp
.(disp

.(Note
Some Open Firmware 1.0.5 machines have their MAC address stored
incorrectly.
Make sure that your netboot server is using the same MAC
address that your \*M client is using.
See the section on

Black screen
.Pp
If your system is a PowerBook,
.Nx
may have turned down the brightness of the backlight.
Use the buttons to turn your brightness back up.
.Pp
Otherwise, you need a serial console.
See the section entitled
.Sx "Open Firmware 1 and 2 System Preparation"
.It
.To 2 "Grey screen with flashing question mark"
Grey screen with flashing question mark
.Pp
This means that your system is trying to boot
.Tn MacOS .
You might get to this state if you didn't properly enter Open Firmware, or if
your Open Firmware boot command has bad syntax.
.Pp
If you typed a bad boot command, Open Firmware tries to boot from the
value stored in the
.Li boot-device
 variable, whose default value is the MacOS ROM.
.Pp
The grey screen with the icon is generated by the MacOS ROM.
A flashing question-mark or broken folder means that your machine
is looking for a bootable MacOS file system, but can't find one.
A globe icon means that your machine is looking for a netboot server.
A happy face or spinning disc means it's starting to boot MacOS.
.Pp
The boot floppy does not have a bootable MacOS file system, it has a
bootable NetBSD file system.
.Pp
Reboot, re-enter Open Firmware and check your syntax carefully.
.Pp
.(Note
Don't forget to check your Open Firmware environment variables, as they
may have been changed by your brief excursion into
.Tn MacOS .

If your machine is Open Firmware version 1.0.5, 2.0.x, or 2.4, this error
does sometimes appear randomly.
You might try the boot command a second time
(this is known to work on some models).
It's also an indication that either your floppy disk is bad,
or the floppy drive is bad.
Try doing a low-level format on the floppy, re-copy the files, and try again.

If you tried one boot command and it failed, then you tried a second and
got the

Use the Open Firmware

command.
.Pp
Contradictorily, if your machine is Open Firmware version 1.0.5, 2.0.x or

Open Firmware either can't open the device you specified (because it is not
present or the device path is mistyped) or the file you specified.
Check your typing and check to make sure that the media has the
files you think it has.

This is a general Open Firmware error message indicating that the filename
you tried to open either doesn't exist or is in the wrong format.
For Open Firmware 1 and 2 machines, it must be an XCOFF file (such as
.Pa ofwboot.xcf )
and for Open Firmware 3 machines, it must be either XCOFF or ELF (such as
a kernel).
Make sure that you have use binary mode to FTP the files, and
that they are properly uncompressed.

If you're trying to boot an Open Firmware 1.0.5, 1.1.22, or 2.0.x system,

As disk drives get older, especially with portables, they can get a
little bit out of alignment so that they do not consistently read disks
written on other floppy drives.  Strongly consider writing the floppies
on the same machine that will be reading them.

Either the server's TFTP server isn't running, or you're using a model

Unfortunately, on the early models,
.Pa ofwboot.xcf
gets confused and doesn't work right unless you load it explicitly from the
.Li boot-device ,
even if the bootp or DHCP server provides the correct information.
You need to boot with a command like:

Actually, this can have many causes.
The most likely is a keyboard problem.
First, try plugging the USB keyboard directly into the computer

If you're trying a model that's not on the supported list (such as a new

Now, you can reboot to get to the Open Firmware prompt.  You still need 
to figure out how to get Open Firmware to boot the operating system(s) of 
your choice.  First, try to get 
.Nx*M
running.  Using the methods described in the section 
.Sx "Examples of Open Firmware boot commands"
figure out the boot command for your installation of
.Nx .
Try booting.  Once you've got the syntax worked out, decide which operating 
systems you'll be using regularly.

If you'll only be using

on your \*M system, then simply set the Open Firmware
.Sq Li boot-device
and
.Sq Li boot-file
variables to the values you just determined.  Also, you might want to 
enable the system to always boot
.Nx
when powered on or reset.  Once you set up auto-booting you can get to 
the Open Firmware prompt again by using the
.Xr shutdown 8
command to halt the system.
.Pp
If you are not using a
.Sq "partition zero"
style boot scheme (e.g. Open Firmware 3 models), then you would type 
something like the following:
.Pp
.(disp
.No 0 \*> Ic "setenv auto-boot? true"
.No 0 \*> Ic "setenv boot-device ide0/disk@0:8,\eofwboot.xcf"
.No 0 \*> Ic "setenv boot-file ide0/disk@0:13,/netbsd"

The last command resets the system so that these settings are stored.

Alas, this takes a little more work.  Usually, when you select a system 
to boot in the
.Dq "Startup Disk"
panel of the 
.Dq "System Preferences"
application, it stores the Open Firmware path to that device in the
.Sq Li boot-device
variable.  So, instead of writing the 
.Nx
device path to Open Firmware, you'll store the paths to your operating 
systems in NVRAM.  Open Firmware cannot deal with nested
.Ic devalias
entries.  You must, therefore, enter the 
.Em entire
path to your device.  See the

For Open Firmware 3 systems, the procedure is identical to the section 
above on
.Sx "Booting NetBSD and MacOS X or Darwin"
.Pp
For older systems, you're in for more hassle.  Booting an Open Firmware 
1.0.5, 2.0.x, or 2.4 system into 
.Tn MacOS
9 or earlier will erase some or all of your Open Firmware settings.  Try 
it and see which Open Firmware variables survive.  
.Pp
If only 
.Sq Li real-base
is lost, you can compile a kernel that does not require changing the
.Sq Li real-base .
Just build a kernel that is less than 4 MB uncompressed.  This is easy if
you remove all of the USB devices from the config file.  Once you've got 
a smaller kernel, just follow the procedure in the section above on
.Sx "Booting NetBSD and MacOS X or Darwin"
.Pp
If everything is lost when you boot into 
.Tn MacOS
9 or earlier, you will need to make a custom BootVars 
configuration that you run before trying to boot
.Nx*M 
since System Disk does not preserve enough information when it saves a 
configuration.
