.Ss2 Prepare yourself
.
Take a deep breath.
.Pp
Good.  Now, make sure you are reading the PDF (if available), PostScript,
or HTML version of this document, as the 
.Pa \&.txt No and Pa \&.more
versions lack important formatting information that will prevent you from
following the twisted path you must follow.  OK, good.  Now, print out
this document.
.Pp
While it's printing, get some coffee, relax a bit, and mentally prepare
yourself for something that promises to be confusing, frustrating, and
annoying.  If you assume the worst, you'll be pleasantly surprised when
everything works easier than you expected.  Also, forget everything you've
been told about installing 
.Nx*M No Ns .
That's right, flush your knowledge cache -- some of it is almost 
certainly dirty.
.Pp
Some of this document assumes familiarity with 
.Tn MacOS ,
e.g. how to download BinHex files and extract things with StuffIt 
Expander.  If you've never heard of those terms before, it is possible to 
install
.Nx*M
without booting or knowing how to use
.Tn MacOS ,
but depending on your model it may be almost as painful as learning a 
little
.Tn MacOS .
See the FAQ for more help:
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/faq.html#macos-newbie
.Pp
It's done printing?  Fine, now get a dark writing implement.
.Pp
The recommended installation procedure is as follows:
.(enum
Go to the 
.Nx*M
model support page and look up your model information and issues (I can't
stress this enough times).
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/models.html
.Pp
.It
Spend about 15 minutes and read through this document from this point
onward.  While you're reading, use the writing implement to cross out the
sections that do not apply to your model (or hilight the sections that do
depending on your preferences).
.Pp
.It
Now spend another 5 minutes and re-read this document, and mentally piece
together how you think you'll be installing onto your machine.  It may
help to take a blank piece of paper and write out an outline of the
procedure you think you'll be going through.
.Pp
.It
Now create your bootable media and media for the distribution sets.
.Pp
.It
Prepare your machine, depending on the instructions for your model
(for example: partition your drive, download and run System Disk, or hook
up a serial console).
.Pp
.It
Boot into Open Firmware, and verify that it has the version of Open
Firmware you think it does.  Also make sure that the other variables
are set correctly.
.Pp
.It
Figure out the correct boot command, and boot your machine from the
bootable media you just created.  If you're having trouble, be sure to
read the section on
.Sx Common Problems and Error Messages
.Pp
.It
Celebrate!  The worst is over, but you've still got some work to do.  Take
a break, maybe more coffee, maybe a quick walk around the block, whatever
turns your fancy.
.Pp
.It
Now use the installer to install the distribution sets onto your system
and do some initial configurations.
.Pp
.It
Figure out how to boot from the installed partition.  Boot into 
.Nx
for the first time.
.Pp
.It
Configure to your preferences, install your favorite packages, and have
fun with your new
.Nx*M
machine!
.enum)
.Pp
.(Note
You really actually truly do need to follow the procedure listed in this
document in the order that we describe.  These systems are rather
tricky to boot for the novice and expert alike.  Once you cross off the
sections that don't apply to you, it will make more sense.
.Note)
.(Note
If the instructions in a subsection below do not apply to 
.Em all
versions of Open Firmware, there will be a line listing which versions of
Open Firmware they apply to, such as:
.br
(Open Firmware 1.0.5, Open Firmware 1.1.22, Open Firmware 2.0.x, Open 
Firmware 2.4, Open Firmware 3)
.Note)
.
.Ss2 Updating your BootROM
.
(Open Firmware 3)
.Pp
Open Firmware 3 systems have a rewritable
.Dq firmware ,
also called the BootROM.  When you use an Apple
firmware updater, it updates the BootROM.  This will 
.Em not
change the version of Open Firmware in your machine - it will still be
Open Firmware 3.  The BootROM is what is first executed when you power on
or reset your system.  The BootROM then loads Open Firmware, which boots
your operating system.
.Pp
Go to the
.Sq "Apple Software Updates"
web site at
.Lk http://asu.info.apple.com/
and search for
.Sq firmware
and install the most recent version for your model.
You will need to run the FirmWare updater from MacOS 9.
.Pp
.(Note
If you accidentally set the 
.Ic load-base No or Ic real-base
Open Firmware variables and reset your machine you will, in effect,
rewrite the BootROM with garbage, rendering your machine unbootable.  We
recommend not doing this.
.Note)
.(Note
The most recent BootROMs available (4.1.7 and later) are
known to have some problems.  
Some PowerMacintosh users find that their third-party 
RAM has been disabled.  See the discussion at
.Lk http://www.macfixit.com/archives/april.01.a.shtml#firm-04-07
.Pp
There are reports that FirmWare Update 4.1.9 on iMac (Summer 2000) will
prevent the CD-ROM and the hard drive from operating together.  You may get
.Pa "wdc0:0:1: lost interrupt"
problems.
.Note)
.Pp
.
.Ss2 Getting to the Open Firmware Prompt on Newer Models
.
(Open Firmware 3)
.Pp
Hold down a special four-key combination when your system boots.
.Pp
After the chime starts, but before it stops, hold down the four
.Key COMMAND-OPTION-O-F
keys (the
.Key COMMAND
key looks like a four-leaf clover or an open apple, and the
.Key OPTION
key may look like a two-way switch with four straight line segments or say 
.Key ALT ) 
until you see the Open Firmware command prompt on your screen:
.Pp
.(disp

since the next several pages are instructions for older models.
.Pp
.
.Ss2 Getting to the Open Firmware Prompt on Apple Network Servers
.
(Open Firmware 1.1.22)
.Pp
The version of Open Firmware in the
Apple Network Servers can only use a serial console.
You must first hook up a serial console
(38400 bps, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, no handshaking) to 
.Sq "Port 2"
(the
.Sq Li ttya
device in Open Firmware).
.Pp
Hold down a special four-key combination on the keyboard attached to
the ADB port on your system (not the serial console) when
your system boots.
.Pp
After the chime starts, but before it stops, hold down the four
.Key COMMAND-OPTION-O-F
keys (the
.Key COMMAND
key looks like a four-leaf clover or an open apple, and the
.Key OPTION
key may look like a two-way switch with four straight line segments or say
.Key ALT ) 
until you see some introductory text and the Open Firmware
command prompt on your serial terminal:
.Pp
.(disp
.No 0 \*>
.disp)
.Pp
Your Apple Network Server's screen will remain black.
.Pp
Now, set your system to always stop at the Open Firmware prompt.
.Pp
.(disp
.No 0 \*> Ic "setenv auto-boot? false
.disp)
.Pp
Skip down to the section on
.Sx Setting up pre-Open Firmware 3 to boot NetBSD
since the next several pages are instructions for MacOS models.
.Pp
.
.Ss2 Getting to the Open Firmware Prompt on Older Models
.
(Open Firmware 1.0.5, Open Firmware 2.0.x, Open Firmware 2.4)
.Pp
These models are significantly trickier than the newer machines.
Open Firmware has two variables,
.Sq input-device
and
.Sq output-device No Ns ,
which specify which devices to use for input and output.  
All Open Firmware 1.0.5 and most Open Firmware 2.0.x systems will default 
to using the 
.Sq Modem
serial port for the console instead of the ADB keyboard and the monitor
attached to the on-board video.
.Pp
Unless you use a MacOS-based utility to set 
these variables correctly, you 
.Em will
need to hook up a serial console temporarily to configure Open Firmware 
to use your keyboard and screen.  Some models (such as the Performa 54xx,
6360, 6400, and 6500) have the 
.Sq Modem
serial port covered with a piece of plastic since the internal modem
usurps that serial port.  You will either need to use Boot Variables to
set the
.Sq input-device
and
.Sq output-device
variables to 
.Sq ttyb
(which is the Printer serial port) or remove the internal modem.
.Pp
Now would be a good time to look at the 
.Nx*M
Model Support webpage to determine the issues with your model.
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/models.html
.Pp
In particular, some models 
.Em must
use a serial console, or they will be unable to boot
.Nx
at all.  All models can be set to use a serial console, if you desire
to bypass the keyboard and screen.
.Pp
If, after re-reading the next several sections, you still need help
figuring out your 
.Sq input-device
and
.Sq output-device
settings, see the FAQ:
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/faq.html#ofw-input-output-devices
.Pp
If you need to use a serial console, you can use a normal 
.Sq printer
cable (mini-DIN 8 to mini-DIN 8) and a 
.Tn MacOS
tool, such as ZTerm to
connect a 
.Tn MacOS
system to your
.Nx*M
system.

.Ss2 Older Open Firmware System Preparation
.
(Open Firmware 1.0.5, Open Firmware 2.0.x, Open Firmware 2.4)
.Pp
All pre-Open Firmware 3 \*M systems have Open Firmware bugs. Luckily, Open 
Firmware has a small
Non-Volatile RAM variable (NVRAM) which is reserved for FORTH commands which
will be run before booting an operating system. Apple has released a freeware
.Tn MacOS
tool called System Disk, which patches
most of these bugs. We
.Em strongly
recommend that you use this tool to patch your Open Firmware,
as several systems cannot boot without these patches.  Instructions for
using System Disk are covered in the next section.
.Pp
Unfortunately, some models are broken by or are unsupported by System Disk.
If you have one of the following models, then skip down to the section on
.Sx Getting to the Open Firmware Prompt (Harder method using MacOS)
.br
Apple Performa 4400, 5500, 6500, 54xx, 6400, and 6360,

.Dq "Stop Boot at Open Firmware prompt"
and select
.Dq OK .
Click the
.Dq Save
button and reboot your system.
.Pp
.(Note
NVRAM patches and Open Firmware settings will be erased if you
.Sq "zap your PRAM"
by holding down
.Key COMMAND-OPTION-P-R
keys during the boot chimes, or if you accidentally boot into 
.Tn MacOS No Ns .
.Note)
.Pp
If your
.Sq output-device
is
.Sq Li /chaos/control
(i.e. you have a PowerMacintosh 7300 - 8600 system), there is a chance that
your monitor will not sync. See
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/SystemDisk-tutorial/of105patch.html
.Pp
You should now see the Open Firmware command prompt on your screen:

.Pp
If your screen is black, then your model does not support using the 
on-board video in
Open Firmware. You will need to connect a serial console to the 
.Sq Modem
port of your system
(38400 bps, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, no handshaking).
.(Note
The
.Dq "Stop Boot at Open Firmware prompt"
setting is persistent.  It is equivalent to the Open Firmware command
.Pp
.(disp

.(Note
Unfortunately, there are a few models that are better off without the System

.Ss2 Getting to the Open Firmware Prompt (Harder method using MacOS)
.
(Open Firmware 1.0.5, Open Firmware 2.0.x, Open Firmware 2.4)
.Pp
If System 
Disk doesn't work because your version of
.Tn MacOS
is too old or because
System Disk says that it doesn't support your model, then you may try using
the 
.Tn MacOS
BootVars tool.
.Pp
.Lk ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/macppc/macos-utils/bootvars/bootvars.sit.hqx
.(Note
BootVars does
.Em not
apply the (possibly critical) NVRAM patches that System Disk does.
Expect some devices to not work (such as booting from hard drives and CD-Rs).
.Note)
.Pp
Look up the proper
.Sq output-device
for your model on the
.Nx*M
Model Support webpage.
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/models.html
If the 
.Nx*M
Model support webpage does not list an 
.Sq output-device
for your model, then your system will default to using the on-board
video.  You needn't fill in the
.Sq output-device
and
.Sq input-device
variables.
.Pp
Launch the
.Tn MacOS
BootVars tool.  Uncheck the
.Dq auto-boot?
checkbox, then check on the
.Dq "All Variables"
checkbox and type
.Ic kbd
into the
.Sq input-device
box, and the proper device name into the
.Sq output-device
box. 
Click on the
.Dq write
button, and then reboot your system.
.Pp
If your
.Sq output-device
is
.Sq Li /chaos/control
(i.e. you have a PowerMacintosh 7300 - 8600 system), there is a chance that
your monitor will not sync. See
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/SystemDisk-tutorial/of105patch.html
.Pp
If you have a Performa 5500 or 6500, you may need to apply NVRAMRC patches
to use your built-in video.  See the information in the NetBSD/macppc
Model Support webpage.
.Pp
You should now see the Open Firmware command prompt on your screen:

.Pp
If your screen is black, then your model has defaulted to using a serial 
console.  This is fairly common on Open Firmware 1 and 2 models if you do not
use the System Disk tool to set up Open Firmware. You must hook up a serial
console (38400 bps, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, no handshaking).
.(Note
The

.
(Open Firmware 1.0.5, Open Firmware 2.0.x, Open Firmware 2.4)
.Pp
If you don't

then you need to hold down a special four-key combination when your system
boots.  Do this on the keyboard attached to
the ADB port on your system (not the serial console or PS/2 port) when
your system boots.
.(Note
Your system will

.Ss2 Available Boot Media
.
(All Open Firmware versions)
.Pp
Each version of Open Firmware is capable of booting from a variety of
media (such as hard drives, floppy disks, CD-ROMs, and ethernet).  Open
Firmware is able to boot files from a variety of filesystems (such as ISO9660,
MS-DOS, and on some models HFS and HFS+).  Unfortunately, Open Firmware is
.Em not
able to use the
.Nx
filesystem (FFS), so we must put the bootloader in a location that Open
Firmware is capable of using.  
.Pp
Therefore, to boot the 
.Nx
kernel, Open Firmware must first open a
.Sq bootloader
which knows how to load the
.Nx
kernel.  There are two approaches, the 
.Pa ofwboot.xcf
bootloader and the
.Sq "partition zero"
bootloader.  In the former case, the user tells Open Firmware to
load
.Pa ofwboot.xcf
and it will load the kernel.  In the latter case, the user tells Open
Firmware to boot from a particular device, and a primary bootloader
.Pa bootxx
is loaded, which then loads the secondary bootloader
.Pa ofwboot
which then loads the kernel.
.(Note
.Pa ofwboot.elf
is obsoleted.  All users should be using
.Pa ofwboot.xcf
instead of 
.Pa ofwboot.elf
now.
.Note)

.Ss2 Description of bootable media
.
(All Open Firmware versions)
.Pp
This section gives a quick description of the various media that can be 
used by Open Firmware to load the bootloader.
.Pp
.(bullet -offset indent
.
.Em "Partition zero"
.br
(Open Firmware 1.0.5, Open Firmware 1.1.22, Open Firmware 2.0.x, Open 
Firmware 2.4)
.Pp
This method loads a primary bootloader called
.Pa bootxx
located in the Apple Partition Map, which then loads the secondary
bootloader
.Pa ofwboot
(functionally identical to
.Pa ofwboot.xcf
(q.v.))
which then loads the kernel.  This is what
.Ic sysinst
will place on your hard drive during the installation procedure.
Additionally, the 
.Nx*M
CD-R images and boot floppies use this method to load a kernel from
the floppy's FFS partition or the CD-R's ISO9660 partition.
.
.It
.Em "Partition zero"
.br
(Open Firmware 3)
.Pp
While Open Firmware 3 supports this boot method, 
.Nx*M
does not yet support it on these systems.
.Pp
.It
.Em "HFS or HFS+ file system"
.br
(Open Firmware 2.4, Open Firmware 3)
.Pp
This method loads 
.Pa ofwboot.xcf
from an HFS or HFS+ partition which then loads the kernel from an acceptable
source (such as an FFS partition or an HFS or HFS+ partition).  The FFS-based
kernel may be on a previously installed 
.Nx
filesystem.
.Pp
Alternatively, the kernel (compressed
or non-compressed) may be on an HFS or HFS+ partition.  Due to Open Firmware
pickiness, it must be on the same partition as
.Pa ofwboot.xcf No Ns .
.
.It
.Em "MS-DOS file system"
.br
(All Open Firmware versions)
.Pp
Load the
.Pa ofwboot.xcf
bootloader from an MS-DOS filesystem (such as a floppy or Zip disk).  It
can then load a
.Nx
kernel from the same MS-DOS filesystem or elsewhere.
.Pp
.
.It
.Em "Ethernet (network boot)"
.br
(All Open Firmware versions)
.Pp
You can run your entire system diskless or netboot only the files necessary
to boot (i.e. the bootloader and the installation kernel),
but you must have root access on another
.Ux
machine on your subnet.
.(Note
You must use your on-board ethernet device for netbooting.  While there
may be some PCI or Cardbus ethernet interfaces with Open Firmware ROMs, no
one has reported success netbooting using these devices
.Note)
.
.It
.Em "ISO9660 CD-ROM file system"
.br
(Open Firmware 1.0.5, Open Firmware 1.1.22, Open Firmware 2.0.x, Open 
Firmware 2.4)
.Pp
Load the
.Pa ofwboot.xcf
bootloader from an ISO9660 CD-ROM.  It can then load a
.Nx
kernel from the ISO9660 CD-ROM.
.Pp
Open Firmware 1.0.5 and 2.0.x machines will
.Em not
boot from the ISO9660 file system if you create a hybrid HFS/ISO
format CD-R. Make sure that the CD
.Em only
has ISO9660 data and does not have an Apple Partition Map.
.(Note
Open Firmware can only open files on the first session of a multi-session
CD-R
.Note)
.
.It
.Em "Hybrid HFS/ISO9660 CD-ROM file system"
.br
(Open Firmware 2.4, Open Firmware 3)
.Pp
Load the
.Pa ofwboot.xcf
bootloader from the CD-ROM's HFS filesystem.  It can then load a
.Nx
kernel from the HFS or ISO9660 filesystem.
.Pp
Make sure that the CD has an Apple Partition Map.

You must use the 
.Nx
installer to partition your disk if you want it to be bootable.  With 
this release of
.Nx No Ns ,
there is no way to dual-boot 
.Tn MacOS
and
.Nx
on one hard drive.
.Pp
You can use the instructions in this section to partition a disk that may
also be used with 
.Tn MacOS No Ns ,
although a disk prepared in this way 
.Em "will not boot"
.Em Nx No Ns .
That means, your root partition
.No ( Ns Pa / No Ns )
must be on a drive prepared with the
.Nx
installer, but the partitions not necessary to boot (for example
.Pa /usr No Ns , 
.Pa /home No Ns , 
or 
.Pa /export No Ns )
may be on the same disk as
.Tn MacOS No Ns .
.Pp
Unless you are planning to use partitions on the same disk as
.Tn MacOS No Ns ,
skip forward to
.Sx Preparing the Bootable Media
.It
.Em "Open Firmware 2.4"
.br
We recommend using the 
.Nx
installer to partition your disk, but you will not be able to use
partitions on this drive with
.Tn MacOS .
.Pp
If you'd like to have
.Tn MacOS
and 
.Nx 
partitions on one hard drive (and for both to be bootable),
then read the rest of this section.
.It
.Em "Open Firmware 3"
.br
You must have at least one disk that was partitioned using a
.Tn MacOS
tool before installing
.Nx
on your system.
.Pp
This is the drive that will be holding the bootloader,
.Pa ofwboot.xcf No Ns .
Your
.Nx
partitions may either be on this same disk (using the method described
in the rest of this section), or on a separate disk accessible only to 
.Nx No Ns .
If you are dedicating an entire disk to
.Nx No Ns ,
then your
.Tn MacOS
partitioned disk only needs HFS or HFS+ partitions.
.Pp
The rest of this section describes how to make a
single disk dual-bootable which is necessary for machines which have only
one hard drive (such as the iBook, iMac, PowerBook, and PowerMacintosh Cube
systems).

.Em "You will need to use the installer's" 
.Em Dq "Re-install sets"

.Pp
There are several contradictory partition numbering schemes.  You may want 
to look at the explanation in the FAQ.
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/faq.html#partitions
.Pp
Unfortunately, the partitioning tools for
.Nx
are not advanced enough to create HFS or HFS+ file systems or a 
partition map that can be shared with
.Tn MacOS .
You will need to use the 
.Tn MacOS
Drive Setup tool (versions 1.8.1 and later are
known to work) to partition the hard drive you will be using for
.Nx .
Drive Setup will erase the contents of your drive -- it does not preserve 
data from any of your partitions.  Make the following partitions:
.(tag "A/UXxUserxxA/UXxFree1xxA/UXxFree2xxA/UXxFree3" -offset indent
.It Em HFS No or Em HFS+
Must be large enough to hold the bootloader, over 100 KB.  May be as large
as you desire for 
.Tn MacOS
usage.
.It Em "A/UX Root"
Must be at least 20 MB. Alternatively, you may decide to use one partition for
your entire
.Nx
installation, in which case it should be at least 200 MB without X, or 250
MB with X.
.Nx
interprets an
.Em "A/UX Root"
partition as the first partition 
.No ( Ns Em a No Ns )
on the disk.  
This partition is not readable from
.Tn MacOS No Ns .
.It Em "A/UX Swap"
Any size. The recommendation is 1.5 times your RAM, although this is not
strictly necessary for machines with a lot of RAM.
.Nx
interprets an
.Em "A/UX Swap"
partition as the second partition
.No ( Ns Em b No Ns )
on the disk.
This partition is not readable from
.Tn MacOS No Ns .
.It Em "A/UX User" No and Em "A/UX Free1"
Use these for any additional partitions you may want to use under
.Nx Ns ,
such as 
.Pa /usr No (at least 200 MB),\  Pa /home No Ns ,\  Pa /usr/local No Ns ,\ or
.Pa /usr/pkg No Ns .
.Nx
interprets these partitions as normal
.Nx No Ns -style
partitions.
These partitions are not readable from
.Tn MacOS No Ns .
.It Em HFS
Any size.  You may want to leave an additional partition available to 
transfer files between
.Tn MacOS
and 
.Nx .
If you think you'll be doing this often, then see the FAQ entry on sharing 
files:
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/faq.html#disk-sharing
.It Em UFS
Any size.  This filesystem type is not currently supported by
.Nx*M
although it might be in the future.  
.Em UFS
partitions are not readable from 
.Tn MacOS
versions prior to X 10.0.0.

.Ss2 Preparing the Bootable Media
.
.
The purpose of this section is to prepare the media from which your system
will boot the installer.  We'll describe how to put the files in the right
places on your disk(s) or netboot server and prepare it for use on your 
system.
.Pp
If you will be running your system diskless (i.e. entirely over NFS, not
using any local hard drives), then you do not need to run the installer,
you only need to extract the distribution sets on the diskless server.
.Pp
To get the distribution sets (which will be placed on your 
hard drive) onto appropriate media, see the above section entitled
.Sx Getting the NetBSD System on to Useful Media
.No Ns .
You may wish to do this at the same time you create the bootable media
(such as netbooting and placing distribution sets on the netboot server,
or booting from CD-R and placing distribution sets on the same disk)
.Pp
.(Note
Some
.Tn MacOS
.Ic ftp
clients default to downloading files in 
.Sq ASCII
mode.  This will render the
.Nx
files useless.  Make sure to set your ftp program to download in
.Sq binary
mode.
