.Ss2 Prepare yourself
.
Take a deep breath.
.Pp
Good.  Now, make sure you are reading the PDF (if available), PostScript,
or HTML version of this document, as the 
.Pa \&.txt No and Pa \&.more
versions lack important formatting information that will prevent you from
following the twisted path you must follow.  OK, good.  Now, print out
this document.
.Pp
While it's printing, get some coffee, relax a bit, and mentally prepare
yourself for something that promises to be confusing, frustrating, and
annoying.  If you assume the worst, you'll be pleasantly surprised when
everything works easier than you expected.  Also, forget everything you've
been told about installing 
.Nx*M No Ns .
.Pp
It's done printing?  Fine, now get a dark writing implement.
.Pp
The recommended installation procedure is as follows:
.(enum
Go to the 
.Nx*M
model support page and look up your model information and issues (I can't
stress this enough times).
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/models.html
.Pp
.It
Spend about 15 minutes and read through this document from this point
onward.  While you're reading, use the writing implement to cross out the
sections that do not apply to your model (or hilight the sections that do
depending on your preferences).
.Pp
.It
Now spend another 5 minutes and re-read this document, and mentally piece
together how you think you'll be installing onto your machine.  It may
help to take a blank piece of paper and write out an outline of the
procedure you think you'll be going through.
.Pp
.It
Now create your bootable media and media for the distribution sets.
.Pp
.It
Prepare your machine, depending on the instructions for your model
(for example: partition your drive, download and run System Disk, or hook
up a serial console).
.Pp
.It
Boot into Open Firmware, and verify that it has the version of Open
Firmware you think it does.  Also make sure that the other variables
are set correctly.
.Pp
.It
Figure out the correct boot command, and boot your machine from the
bootable media you just created.  If you're having trouble, be sure to
read the section on
.Sx Common Problems and Error Messages
.Pp
.It
Celebrate!  The worst is over, but you've still got some work to do.  Take
a break, maybe more coffee, maybe a quick walk around the block, whatever
turns your fancy.
.Pp
.It
Now use the installer to install the distribution sets onto your system
and do some initial configurations.
.Pp
.It
Figure out how to boot from the installed partition.  Boot into 
.Nx
for the first time.
.Pp
.It
Configure to your preferences, install your favorite packages, and have
fun with your new
.Nx*M
machine!
.enum)
.Pp
.(Note
You really actually truly do need to follow the procedure listed in this
document in the order that we describe.  These systems are rather
tricky to boot for the novice and expert alike.  Once you cross off the
sections that don't apply to you, it will make more sense.
.Note)
.(Note
If the instructions in a subsection below do not apply to 
.Em all
versions of Open Firmware, there will be a line listing which versions of
Open Firmware they apply to, such as:
.br
(Open Firmware 1.0.5, Open Firmware 1.1.22, Open Firmware 2.0.x, Open 
Firmware 2.4, Open Firmware 3)
.Note)
.
.Ss2 Updating your BootROM
.
(Open Firmware 3)
.Pp
Open Firmware 3 systems have a rewritable
.Dq firmware ,
also called the BootROM.  When you use an Apple
firmware updater, it updates the BootROM.  This will 
.Em not
change the version of Open Firmware in your machine - it will still be
Open Firmware 3.  The BootROM is what is first executed when you power on
or reset your system.  The BootROM then loads Open Firmware, which boots
your operating system.
.Pp
Go to the
.Sq "Apple Software Updates"
web site at
.Lk http://asu.info.apple.com/
and search for
.Sq firmware
and install the most recent version for your model.
.Pp
.(Note
If you accidentally set the 
.Ic load-base No or Ic real-base
Open Firmware variables and reset your machine you will, in effect,
rewrite the BootROM with garbage, rendering your machine unbootable.  We
recommend not doing this.
.Note)
.(Note
The most recent BootROMs available (4.1.7 and 4.1.8) as of May 2001 are
known to have some problems.  Some PowerBook G4 users find they are
unable to boot 
.Nx
after upgrading, and some PowerMacintosh users find that their third-party 
RAM has been disabled.  See the discussion at
.Lk http://www.macfixit.com/archives/april.01.a.shtml#firm-04-07
.Note)
.Pp
.
.Ss2 Getting to the Open Firmware Prompt on Newer Models
.
(Open Firmware 3)
.Pp
Hold down a special key combination when your system boots.
.Pp
After the chime starts, but before it stops, hold down the
.Key COMMAND-OPTION-O-F
keys (the
.Key COMMAND
key looks like a four-leaf clover or an open apple, and the
.Key OPTION
key may look like a two-way switch with four straight line segments).
.Pp
You should now see the Open Firmware command prompt on your screen:
.Pp

.
.Ss2 Getting to the Open Firmware Prompt on Apple Network Servers
.
(Open Firmware 1.1.22)
.Pp
The version of Open Firmware in the
Apple Network Servers can only use a serial console.
You must first hook up a serial console
(38400 bps, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, no handshaking) to 
.Sq "Port 2"
(the
.Sq Li ttya
device in Open Firmware).
.Pp
Hold down a special key combination on the keyboard attached to
the ADB port on your system (not the serial console or PS/2 port) when
your system boots.
.Pp
After the chime starts, but before it stops, hold down the
.Key COMMAND-OPTION-O-F
keys (the
.Key COMMAND
key looks like a four-leaf clover or an open apple, and the

.Ss2 Older Open Firmware System Preparation
.
(Open Firmware 1.0.5, Open Firmware 2.0.x, Open Firmware 2.4)
.Pp
These models are significantly trickier than the newer machines.
.Pp
All pre-Open Firmware 3 \*M systems have Open Firmware bugs. Luckily, Open 
Firmware has a small
Non-Volatile RAM variable (NVRAM) which is reserved for FORTH commands which
will be run before booting an operating system. Apple has released a freeware
.Tn MacOS
tool called System Disk, which patches
most of these bugs. We
.Em strongly
recommend that you use this tool to patch your Open Firmware,
as several systems cannot boot without these patches.  If you read
the Model Support page, you'd also know that some models are broken by
or are unsupported by System Disk.
.Pp
If you have one of the following models, then skip down to the section on
.Sx Getting to the Open Firmware Prompt (Harder method using MacOS)
.br
Apple Performa 4400, 5500, 6500, 54xx, 6400, and 6360,

.br
PowerComputing PowerBase,
.br
Umax Apus 2000, Apus 3000, C500, and C600
.Pp
For every other model, download System Disk from Apple's site:
.Lk ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/macosxserver/utilities/SystemDisk2.3.1.smi.bin
.Pp
For a brief tutorial on how to use System Disk, see:
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/SystemDisk-tutorial/
.Pp
Make sure you click the
.Dq Save
button, or the patches will not be saved to NVRAM.
.(Note
NVRAM patches and Open Firmware settings will be erased if you
.Sq "zap your PRAM"
by holding down
.Key COMMAND-OPTION-P-R
keys during the boot chimes, or if you accidentally boot into 
.Tn MacOS No Ns .
.Note)
.Pp
.
.Ss2 Getting to the Open Firmware Prompt on Older Models
.
(Open Firmware 1.0.5, Open Firmware 2.0.x, Open Firmware 2.4)
.Pp
Open Firmware has two variables,
.Sq input-device
and
.Sq output-device No Ns ,
which specify which devices to use for input and output.  
.Pp
All Open Firmware 1.0.5 and most Open Firmware 2.0.x systems will default 
to using the 
.Sq Modem
serial port for the console instead of the ADB keyboard and the monitor
attached to the on-board video.
Unless you use a MacOS-based utility to set 
these variables correctly, you 
.Em will
need to hook up a serial console temporarily to set them before you 
can use your keyboard and screen.  Some models (such as the Performa 54xx,
6360, 6400, and 6500) have the 
.Sq Modem
serial port covered with a piece of plastic since the internal modem
usurps that serial port.  You will either need to use Boot Variables to
set the
.Sq input-device
and
.Sq output-device
variables to 
.Sq ttyb
(which is the Printer serial port) or remove the internal modem.
.Pp
Now would be a good time to look at the 
.Nx*M
Model Support webpage to determine the issues with your model.
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/models.html
.Pp
In particular, some models 
.Em must
use a serial console, or they will be unable to boot
.Nx
at all.  All models can be set to use a serial console, if you desire
to bypass the keyboard and screen.
.Pp
If you need to use a serial console, you can use a normal 
.Sq printer
cable (mini-DIN 8 to mini-DIN 8) and a 
.Tn MacOS
tool, such as ZTerm to
connect a 
.Tn MacOS
system to your
.Nx*M
system.

.Dq OK .
Click the
.Dq Save
button and reboot your system.
.Pp
If your
.Sq output-device
is

(i.e. you have a PowerMacintosh 7300 - 8600 system), there is a chance that
your monitor will not sync. See

If your screen is black, then your model does not support using the 
on-board video in
Open Firmware. You will need to connect a serial console to the 
.Sq Modem
port of your system
(38400 bps, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, no handshaking).
.(Note
The
.Dq "Stop Boot at Open Firmware prompt"
setting is persistent.  It is equivalent to the Open Firmware command
.Pp
.Dl 0 > Ic "setenv auto-boot? false
.Note)
.(Note
Unfortunately, there are a few models that are better off without the System
Disk patches.  If you find that your machine doesn't boot, then try:

.Dl 0 > Ic "reset-all"
.Note)
.
.Ss2 Getting to the Open Firmware Prompt (Harder method using MacOS)

(Open Firmware 1.0.5, Open Firmware 2.0.x, Open Firmware 2.4)
.Pp
If System 
Disk doesn't work because your version of
.Tn MacOS
is too old or because
System Disk says that it doesn't support your model, then you may try using
the 
.Tn MacOS
BootVars tool.
.Pp

.(Note
BootVars does

apply the (possibly critical) NVRAM patches that System Disk does.
Expect some devices to not work (such as hard drives and ethernet).
.Note)
.Pp
Look up the proper
.Sq output-device
for your model on the
.Nx*M
Model Support webpage.
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/models.html
If the 
.Nx*M
Model support webpage does not list an

for your model, then your system will default to using the on-board
video.  You needn't fill in the
.Sq output-device
and

.Ss2 Available Boot Media
.
(All Open Firmware versions)
.Pp
Each version of Open Firmware is capable of booting from a variety of
media (such as hard drives, CD-ROMs, and ethernet).  To boot the
.Nx
kernel, Open Firmware must first open a
.Sq bootloader
which knows how to load the
.Nx
kernel.  There are two approaches, the 
.Pa ofwboot.xcf
bootloader and the
.Sq "partition zero"
bootloader.  In the former case, the user tells Open Firmware to
load
.Pa ofwboot.xcf
and it will load the kernel.  In the latter case, the user tells Open
Firmware to boot from a particular device, and a primary bootloader
.Pa bootxx
is loaded, which then loads the secondary bootloader
.Pa ofwboot
which then loads the kernel.
.(Note
.Pa ofwboot.elf
is obsoleted.  All users should be using
.Pa ofwboot.xcf
instead of 
.Pa ofwboot.elf
now.
.Note)
.Pp
See the FAQ for a more thorough explanation:
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/faq.html#boot-support

Unfortunately, the partitioning tools for

You will need to use the 
.Tn MacOS
Drive Setup tool (versions 1.8.1 and later are
known to work) to partition the hard drive you will be using for
.Nx .
Drive Setup will erase the contents of your drive -- it does not preserve 
data from any of your partitions.  Make the following partitions:
.(tag "A/UX_Rootxxx" -offset indent
.It Em HFS No or Em HFS+
Must be large enough to hold the bootloader, over 100 KB.  May be as large
as you desire for

Must be at least 20 MB. Alternatively, you may decide to use one partition for
your entire
.Nx
installation, in which case it should be at least 200 MB without X, or 250

.Nx
interprets an
.Em "A/UX Root"

.Ss2 Preparing the Bootable Media

.
The purpose of this section is to prepare the media from which your system
will boot the installer.  We'll describe how to put the files in the right
places on your disk(s) or netboot server and prepare it for use on your 
system.
.Pp
If you will be running your system diskless (i.e. entirely over NFS, not
using any local hard drives), then you do not need to run the installer,
you only need to extract the distribution sets on the diskless server.
.Pp
To get the distribution sets (which will be placed on your 
hard drive) onto appropriate media, see the above section entitled
.Sx Getting the NetBSD System on to Useful Media
.No Ns .
You may wish to do this at the same time you create the bootable media
(such as netbooting and placing distribution sets on the netboot server,
or booting from CD-R and placing distribution sets on the same disk)
.Pp
.(Note
Some

Once Open FIrmware has downloaded the bootloader via TFTP, it will
then load the installation kernel via an NFS connection.
