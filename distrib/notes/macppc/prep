.Ss2 Gather Information
.
Go to the
.Nx*M
Model Support webpage and look up your system. Take note of the comments
about your model and keep these in mind during the rest of this 
installation
procedure.
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/models.html
.Pp
Also, you 
.Em must
know what version of Open Firmware is in the machine you will be 
installing
.Nx*M
onto.  The instructions that follow will make absolutely no sense
if you follow directions for a version of Open Firmware other than
the one on your machine.
.Pp
If the instructions in a subsection below do not apply to 
.Em all
versions of Open Firmware, there will be a line listing which versions of
Open Firmware they apply to, such as:
.br
(Open Firmware 1.0.5, Open Firmware 1.1.22, Open Firmware 2.0.x, Open 
Firmware 2.4, Open Firmware 3)
.
.Ss2 Open Firmware System Preparation
.
(Open Firmware 1.0.5, Open Firmware 2.0.x, Open Firmware 2.4)
.Pp
All pre-Open Firmware 3 \*M systems have Open Firmware bugs. Luckily, Open 
Firmware has a small
Non-Volatile RAM variable (NVRAM) which is reserved for FORTH commands which
will be run before booting an operating system. Apple has released a freeware
.Tn MacOS
tool called System Disk, which patches
most of these bugs. We
.Em strongly
recommend that you use this tool to patch your Open Firmware,
as several systems cannot boot without these patches.  If you read
the Model Support page, you'd also know that some models are broken by
or are unsupported by System Disk.  If you are trying to install on such
a model, then skip the rest of this section.
.Pp
Download System Disk from Apple's site:
.Lk ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/macosxserver/utilities/SystemDisk2.3.1.smi.bin
.Pp
For a brief tutorial on how to use System Disk, see:
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/SystemDisk-tutorial/
.Pp
Make sure you click the
.Dq Save
button, or the patches will not be saved to NVRAM.
.(Note
NVRAM patches and Open Firmware settings will be erased if you
.Sq zap your PRAM
by holding down
.Key COMMAND-OPTION-P-R
keys during the boot chimes
.Note)
.Pp
.
.Ss2 Updating your firmware
.
(Open Firmware 3)
.Pp
Open Firmware 3 systems have a rewritable firmware. Go to the
.Sq Apple Software Updates
web site at
.Lk http://asu.info.apple.com/
and search for
.Sq firmware
and install the most recent version for your model.
.Pp
.(Note
The most recent versions available (4.1.7 and 4.1.8) as of April 2001 are
known to have some problems.  Some PowerBook G4 users find they are
unable to boot 
.Nx
after upgrading, and some PowerMacintosh users find that their third-party 
RAM has been disabled.  See the discussion at
.Lk http://www.macfixit.com/archives/april.01.a.shtml#firm-04-07
.Note)
.Pp
.
.Ss2 Getting to the Open Firmware Prompt on Newer Models
.
(Open Firmware 3)
.Pp
Hold down a special key combination when your system boots.
.Pp
After the chime starts, but before it stops, hold down the
.Key COMMAND-OPTION-O-F
keys (the
.Key COMMAND
key looks like a four-leaf clover or an open apple, and the
.Key OPTION
key may look like a two-way switch with four straight line segments).
.Pp
You should now see the Open Firmware command prompt:
.Pp
.Dl 0 >
.Pp
Now, set your system to always stop at the Open Firmware prompt.
.Pp
.Dl 0 > Ic "setenv auto-boot? false
.Pp
To undo this, and allow Open Firmware to automatically boot the specified 
operating system when the system is rebooted, type:
.Pp
.Dl 0 > Ic "setenv auto-boot? true
.Pp
Skip down to the section on
.Sx Setting up Open Firmware 3 to boot NetBSD
since the next several pages are instructions for older models.
.Pp
.
.Ss2 Getting to the Open Firmware Prompt on Apple Network Servers
.
(Open Firmware 1.1.22)
.Pp
Hold down a special key combination when your system boots.
.Pp
After the chime starts, but before it stops, hold down the
.Key COMMAND-OPTION-O-F
keys (the
.Key COMMAND
key looks like a four-leaf clover or an open apple, and the
.Key OPTION
key may look like a two-way switch with four straight line segments).
.Pp
You should now see the Open Firmware command prompt:
.Pp
.Dl 0 >
.Pp
Your screen remains black, since the version of Open Firmware in the
Apple Network Servers can only use a serial console.
You must hook up a serial console
(38400 bps, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, no handshaking) to 
.Sq Port 2
(the
.Sq Li ttya
device in Open Firmware).
.Pp
Now, set your system to always stop at the Open Firmware prompt.
.Pp
.Dl 0 > Ic "setenv auto-boot? false
.Pp
To undo this, and allow Open Firmware to automatically boot the specified 
operating system when the system is rebooted, type:
.Pp
.Dl 0 > Ic "setenv auto-boot? true
.Pp
Skip down to the section on
.Sx Setting up pre-Open Firmware 3 to boot NetBSD
since the next several pages are instructions for MacOS models.
.Pp
.
.Ss2 Getting to the Open Firmware Prompt on Older Models
.
(Open Firmware 1.0.5, Open Firmware 2.0.x, Open Firmware 2.4)
.Pp
These models are significantly trickier than the newer machines.
.Pp
Open Firmware has two variables,
.Sq input-device
and
.Sq output-device No Ns ,
which specify which devices to use for input and output.  
.Pp
All Open Firmware 1.0.5 and most Open Firmware 2.0.x systems will default 
to using the 
.Sq Modem
serial port for the console instead of the ADB keyboard and the monitor
attached to the on-board video.
Unless you use a MacOS-based utility to set 
these variables correctly, you 
.Em will
need to hook up a serial console temporarily to set them before you 
can use your keyboard and screen.
.Pp
Now would be a good time to look at the 
.Nx*M
Model Support webpage to determine the issues with your model.
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/models.html
.Pp
In particular, some models 
.Em must
use a serial console, or they will be unable to boot
.Nx
at all.  All models can be set to use a serial console, if you desire
to bypass the keyboard and screen.
.Pp
If you need to use a serial console, you can use a normal 
.Sq printer
cable (mini-DIN 8 to mini-DIN 8) and a 
.Tn MacOS
tool, such as ZTerm to
connect a 
.Tn MacOS
system to your
.Nx*M
system.
.Lk http://hyperarchive.lcs.mit.edu/HyperArchive/Archive/comm/term/zterm-101.hqx
.
.Ss2 Getting to the Open Firmware Prompt (Recommended method using MacOS)
.
(Open Firmware 1.0.5, Open Firmware 2.0.x, Open Firmware 2.4)
.Pp
Launch the
.Tn MacOS
System Disk tool. Click on
.Dq "Power User (Open Firmware)"
then click on the
.Dq "Advanced Options"
button. Now, click on the checkbox that says
.Dq "Stop Boot at Open Firmware prompt"
and select
.Dq OK .
Click the
.Dq Save
button and reboot your system.
.Pp
If your
.Sq output-device
is
.Sq Li /chaos/control
(i.e. you have a PowerMacintosh 7300 - 8600 system), there is a chance that
your monitor will not sync. See
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/SystemDisk-tutorial/of105patch.html
.Pp
You should now see the Open Firmware command prompt:
.Pp
.Dl 0 >
.Pp
If your screen is black, then your model does not support using the 
on-board video in
Open Firmware. You will need to connect up a serial console
(38400 bps, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, no handshaking).
.(Note
The
.Dq Stop Boot at Open Firmware prompt
setting is persistent.  Your system will always stop at the Open Firmware
prompt unless you uncheck this checkbox or tell Open Firmware
.Pp
.Dl 0 > Ic "setenv auto-boot? true
.Note)
.(Note
Unfortunately, there are a few models that are better off without the System
Disk patches.  If you find that your machine doesn't boot, then try:
.Pp
.Dl 0 > Ic "setenv use-nvramrc? false"
.Dl 0 > Ic "reset-all"
.Note)
.
.Ss2 Getting to the Open Firmware Prompt (Harder method using MacOS)
.
(Open Firmware 1.0.5, Open Firmware 2.0.x, Open Firmware 2.4)
.Pp
If System 
Disk doesn't work because your version of
.Tn MacOS
is too old or because
System Disk says that it doesn't support your model, then you may try using
the 
.Tn MacOS
BootVars tool.
.Pp
.Lk ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/macppc/macos-utils/bootvars/bootvars.sit.hqx
.(Note
BootVars does
.Em not
apply the (possibly critical) NVRAM patches that System Disk does.
Expect some devices to not work.
.Note)
.Pp
Look up the proper
.Sq output-device
for your model on the
.Nx*M
Model Support webpage.
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/models.html
If the 
.Nx*M
Model support webpage does not list an 
.Sq output-device
for your model, then your system will default to using the on-board
video.  You needn't fill in the
.Sq output-device
and
.Sq input-device
variables.
.Pp
Launch the
.Tn MacOS
BootVars tool.  Click on the
.Dq auto-boot?
checkbox, then click on the
.Dq All Variables
checkbox and type
.Ic kbd
into the
.Sq input-device
box, and the proper device name into the
.Sq output-device
box. 
Click on the
.Dq write
button, and then reboot your system.
.Pp
If your
.Sq output-device
is
.Sq Li /chaos/control
(i.e. you have a PowerMacintosh 7300 - 8600 system), there is a chance that
your monitor will not sync. See
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/SystemDisk-tutorial/of105patch.html
.Pp
You should now see the Open Firmware command prompt:
.Pp
.Dl 0 >
.Pp
If your screen is black, then your model has defaulted to using a serial 
console.  This is fairly common on Open Firmware 1 and 2 models if you do not
use the System Disk tool to set up Open Firmware. You must hook up a serial
console (38400 bps, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, no handshaking).
.(Note
The
.Dq auto-boot?
setting is persistent.  Your system will always stop at the Open Firmware
prompt unless you uncheck this checkbox or tell Open Firmware
.Pp
.Dl 0 > Ic "setenv auto-boot? true
.Note)
.
.Ss2 Getting to the Open Firmware Prompt (Without using MacOS)
.
(Open Firmware 1.0.5, Open Firmware 2.0.x, Open Firmware 2.4)
.Pp
If you don't 
have
.Tn MacOS ,
then you need to hold down a special key combination when your system boots.
.(Note
Your system will
.Em not
have the (possibly critical) NVRAM patches that System Disk applies.
Expect some devices to not work.
.Note)
.Pp
After the chime starts, but before it stops, hold down the
.Key COMMAND-OPTION-O-F
keys (the
.Key COMMAND
key looks like a four-leaf clover or an open apple, and the
.Key OPTION
key may look like a two-way switch with four straight line segments).
.Pp
You should now see the Open Firmware command prompt:
.Pp
.Dl 0 >
.Pp
If your screen is black, then your system has defaulted to using a serial

(38400 bps, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, no handshaking).
.Pp
Now, set your system to always stop at the Open Firmware prompt.
.Pp

.Pp
To undo this, and allow Open Firmware to automatically boot the specified 
operating system when the system is rebooted, type:
.Pp
.Dl 0 > Ic "setenv auto-boot? true
.Pp
To use your on-board video and keyboard, look up the proper
.Sq output-device
for your model on the
.Nx*M
webpage
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/models.html
Run the following commands to use your screen instead of
a serial console
(replace
.Sq Li screen
with the correct
.Sq output-device
for your model):
.Pp
.Dl 0 > Ic "setenv output-device screen"
.Dl 0 > Ic "setenv input-device kbd"
.Dl 0 > Ic "reset-all"
.Pp
Now you should see the Open Firmware prompt on your screen.
.Pp
If your
.Sq output-device
is
.Sq Li /chaos/control
(i.e. you have a PowerMacintosh 7300 - 8600 system), there is a chance that

.Ss2 Setting up pre-Open Firmware 3 to boot NetBSD
.
(Open Firmware 1.0.5, Open Firmware 1.1.22, Open Firmware 2.0.x, 
Open Firmware 2.4)
.Pp
Double-check your Open Firmware version:
.Pp
.Dl 0 > Ic "dev /openprom"
.Dl 0 > Ic ".properties"
.Pp
If your system has Open Firmware prior to version 3, then you must set
some Open Firmware variables before
.Nx
can boot.  Do
.Em not
run these commands on Open Firmware 3 machines, as you may overwrite your
firmware requiring a trip to Apple for repairs.
.Pp
.Dl 0 > Ic "setenv load-base 600000"
.Dl 0 > Ic "setenv real-base F00000"
.Dl 0 > Ic "reset-all"
.Pp
The last command reboots your machine so that the
.Li real-base
setting takes effect.
.Pp
If you will be netbooting your system, you can look up your MAC address.
.Pp
.Dl 0 > Ic "dev enet .properties"
.Dl "[...]"
.Dl "local-mac-address   CCCCCCCC CCCC"
.Dl "[...]"
.Pp
.(Note
Some early Open Firmware 1.0.5 machines had their MAC address stored
incorrectly on the motherboard (little- vs. big-endian problems).
The patches the System Disk installs will correct this.
Without the patch, the machine will still work, but its MAC address
may conflict with another ethernet device on your network.
.Note)
.Pp
For future reference, when you want to boot into
.Tn MacOS ,
type:
.Dl 0 > Ic bye
.(Note
Open Firmware 1.0.5 settings and nvram patches will be erased if you boot into
.Tn MacOS .
You will need to re-enter them before booting
.Nx
again.
.Note)
.Pp
.(Note
Open Firmware 2.0.x and Open Firmware 2.4 systems will set the
.Li real-base
environment variable to its default value (which doesn't work) if you boot
into 
.Tn MacOS .
.Note)
.
.Ss2 Setting up Open Firmware 3 to boot NetBSD
.
(Open Firmware 3)
.Pp
Double-check your Open Firmware version:
.Pp
.Dl 0 > Ic "dev /openprom"
.Dl 0 > Ic ".properties"
.Pp
If you will be netbooting your system, you can look up your MAC address.
.Pp
.Dl 0 > Ic "dev enet .properties"
.Dl "[...]"
.Dl "local-mac-address   CCCCCCCC CCCC"
.Dl "[...]"
.Pp
.(Note
Some Open Firmware 3 machines have their MAC address stored incorrectly
(little- vs. big-endian problem). If you look up your MAC address in
.Tn MacOS ,
it will be different than what Open Firmware 3 uses to contact your netboot
server. Your machine will still work, but its MAC address may conflict with
another ethernet device on your network.
.Note)
.Pp
For future reference, when you want to boot into
.Tn MacOS ,
type:
.Dl 0 > Ic mac-boot
.
.Ss2 Available Boot Media
.
(All Open Firmware versions)
.Pp
Each version of Open Firmware is capable of booting from a variety of
media.  To boot the
.Nx
kernel, Open Firmware must first open a
.Sq bootloader
which knows how to load the
.Nx
kernel.  There are two approaches, the 
.Pa ofwboot.xcf
bootloader and the
.Sq partition zero
bootloader.  In the former case, the user tells Open Firmware to
load
.Pa ofwboot.xcf
and it will load the kernel.  In the latter case, the user tells Open
Firmware to boot from a particular device, and a primary bootloader
.Pa bootxx
is loaded, which then loads the secondary bootloader
.Pa ofwboot
which then loads the kernel.
.Pp
See the FAQ for a more thorough explanation:
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/faq.html#boot-support
.Pp
The following bootable media are available for loading the bootloader
.Pq Pa ofwboot No or Pa ofwboot.xcf

.Pp
This method loads a primary bootloader called
.Pa bootxx
which then loads the secondary bootloader
.Pa ofwboot
(functionally identical to
.Pa ofwboot.xcf
(q.v.))
which then loads the kernel.
This is the method used by the boot floppies, and when you're
installing
.Nx
on the entire disk.
Unfortunately, it appears that the Open Firmare 2.4 floppy disk driver
is broken.

.Ss2 Creating the Bootable Media
.
The idea is to run an installer which will place
.Nx
on a hard drive on your \*M system.
.Pp
If you will be running your system diskless (i.e. entirely over NFS, not
using any local hard drives), then you do not need to run the installer.
.Pp
This section describes how to create bootable media, including the 
installer.  To get the installation sets (which will be placed on your 
hard drive) onto appropriate media, see the above section entitled
.Sx Getting the NetBSD System on to Useful Media
.Pp
.(Note
Some
.Tn MacOS
.Ic ftp
clients default to downloading files in 
.Sq ASCII
mode.  This will render the
.Nx
files useless.  Make sure to set your ftp program to download in
.Sq binary
mode.
.Note)

These are the recommended techniques for booting the

.Em "Boot over the ethernet"
.br
(All Open Firmware versions)
.Pp
Set up the DHCP daemon in BOOTP compatable mode, the TFTP daemon, and
the NFS daemons on your netboot server.
Tell Open Firmware to boot over ethernet, and it will send a BOOTP
request, which will tell Open Firmware what your system's IP address
is, and where its bootloader can be downloaded via TFTP.
Once Open FIrmware has downloaded the bootloader via TFTP, it will
then load the installation kernel via an NFS connection.
.Pp
Follow these instructions to configure a
.Nx
machine as your netboot server.  If you intend to use a different platform 
as your netboot server, follow the directions in the Diskless HOW-TO:
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/network/netboot
.Pp
We will use 
.Sq Li CC:CC:CC:CC:CC:CC
as the MAC address (ethernet hardware address) of your netboot client machine
that you wish to install
.Nx
on.  We use 
.Sq Li 192.168.1.10
as the IP address of your client, and
.Sq Li client.test.net
as the name.  The server name is
.Sq Li server.test.net ,
and the path on the server to the NFS exported directory is 
.Pa /export/client/root
although you may choose to use a different path.
.Pp
Now, set up your 
.Ic dhcpd
server.  Make sure the following lines are in
.Pa /etc/dhcpd.conf :
.(disp
allow bootp;	# Allow bootp requests, thus the dhcp server
		# will act as a bootp server.

subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
		# Which network interface the server will
		# listen on.  The zeros indicate which
		# range of addresses are allowed to connect.
}

group {                                
		# Set of parameters common to all clients
		# in this "group".
		#
	option broadcast-address	192.168.1.255;
	option domain-name		"test.net";
	option domain-name-servers	dns.test.net;
	option routers			router.test.net;

		# An individual client.
		#
	host client.test.net {
		hardware ethernet	CC:CC:CC:CC:CC:CC;
		fixed-address		192.168.1.10;

		# Name of the host (if the fixed address
		# doesn't resolve to a simple name).
		#
		option host-name	"client";

		# Name of the bootloader or kernel
		# to download via tftp.
		#
		filename		"ofwboot.xcf";

		# The path on the NFS server.
		#
		option	root-path	"/export/client/root";
	}
}
.disp)
.Pp
You will need to make sure that the
.Pa dhcpd.leases
file exists.
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "touch /var/db/dhcpd.leases"
.Pp
You will need to 
.Ic kill
the
.Ic dhcpd
and restart it to get it to re-read its configuration file.
If the server is running
.Nx 1.5 ,
you can achieve this with:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "/etc/rc.d/dhcpd restart"
.Pp
Now, place a copy of the
.Pa installation/ofwboot.xcf
bootloader in 
.Pa /tftpboot
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "cp ofwboot.xcf /tftpboot"
.Pp
Now, you should edit
.Pa /etc/inetd.conf
and make sure that the line starting with 
.Li tftp
is uncommented.  You will need to
.Ic kill -HUP
the
.Ic inetd
process to enable tftp if this line was previously commented out.  The next
step is to set up NFS exports.  Create the directory you are exporting for
the netboot client:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "mkdir -p /export/client/root"
.Pp
Put the following line in
.Pa /etc/exports
to enable NFS sharing:
.Pp
.Dl "/export/client/root -maproot=root client.test.net"
.Pp
If your server is currently running NFS services, you only need to 
.Ic "kill -HUP"
the
.Ic mountd
process.  Otherwise, you need to run:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "/usr/sbin/mountd"
.Dl # Ic "/usr/sbin/nfsd -tun 4"
.Pp
Now, you need to place the files your netboot client will need.
As noted above in the section
.Pa Preparing your System for NetBSD Installation
you have several options when choosing a location to store the
distribution
filesets. However, the easiest way is to put the distribution
files into the exported directory for your client on the server.
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "mv *.tgz /export/client/root"
.Pp
Your client will need a kernel to boot (use 
.Pa installation/netbsd.ram.gz ) .
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "gunzip netbsd.ram.gz"
.Dl # Ic "mv netbsd.ram /export/client/root/netbsd"

.br
We recommend using the

installer to partition your disk, but you will not be able to share it

If you'd like to dual-boot with

on a shared drive, read the rest of this section.
.It

.br
.Em "Do not edit your partitions in the installer."
You must partition your disk in
.Tn MacOS
before installing
.Nx
on your system.
.bullet)
.Pp
Unfortunately, the partitioning tools for
.Nx
are not advanced enough to create HFS or HFS+ file systems or a 
partition map that can be shared with
.Tn MacOS .
You will need to use the 
.Tn MacOS
Drive Setup tool (versions 1.9.1 and later are
known to work) to partition the hard drive you will be using for
.Nx .
Drive Setup will erase the contents of your drive -- it does not preserve 
data from any of your partitions.  Make the following partitions:
.(tag "A/UX_Rootxxx" -offset indent
.It Em HFS No or Em HFS+
Must be large enough to hold the bootloader, over 100 KB.
.It Em A/UX Root
Must be at least 20 MB. Alternatively, you may decide to use one partition for
your entire
.Nx
installation, in which case it should be at least 200 MB.
.It Em A/UX Swap
Any size. The recommenation is 1.5 times your RAM, although this is not
strictly necessary for machines with a lot of RAM.
.It Em A/UX User, A/UX Free1, A/UX Free2, A/UX Free3
Use these for any additional partitions you may want to use under
.Nx .
.It Em HFS
Any size.  You may want to leave an additional  partition available to 
share between
.Tn MacOS
and 
.Nx .
