Currently,
.Nx*M
requires the use of
.Tn "Open Firmware"
to boot.
Open Firmware is a command environment using the FORTH language.  The
.Nx
kernel uses Open Firmware to gather information about your system and to 
control some of your devices.  It is part of the boot ROMs in most
.Tn PowerPC Ns No -based
.Tn Macintosh
systems.
Until late 1996,
.Tn Apple
never intended to use Open Firmware for anything other than internal debugging and hardware support.
It was not intended to be used to boot an operating system.
This is why earlier machines have so much trouble with Open Firmware.
This also means that PowerMacs and clones that lack Open Firmware cannot boot
.Nx
on the \*M platform.
Most machines introduced by Apple and the clone-makers
after August 17, 1995 have Open Firmware and are supported.
.Pp
Apple made several revisions of this Open Firmware environment, and each has
various quirks and problems that we must work around.
The single hardest step of installing
.Nx*M
is to set up Open Firmware properly.
Open Firmware versions 1.0.5 and 2.0.x act similarly
and the same set of instructions applies to them.
Open Firmware version 2.4 is slightly different with regards to booting.
Open Firmware version 3 is altogether different, but easier to set up for 
.Nx .
.Pp
The minimal configuration requires 16 MB of RAM and 160 MB of disk space.
To install the entire system requires considerably more, plus space for the
swap partition (usually the RAM size, unless you've got a lot of RAM).
To use X, 32MB of RAM is required.
.Nx
with 16 MB of RAM is very slow.  Until you have around 32 MB of RAM,
getting more RAM is more important than getting a faster CPU.

Most CPU upgrades are supported.
Some older models will not automatically enable the L2 and/or L3 caches on
a G3 or G4 processor.

Open Firmware will default to using the serial port for the console.

Each version of Open Firmware supports different devices and media that you
may boot from.
We define the terms
.Dq "bootable media"
as the media (hard drive, floppy, CD-R, ethernet) that will be used to
bootstrap your \*M system into
.Nx ,
and
.Dq "distribution sets"
or
.Dq "distribution media"
as the media (hard drive, CD-R, ethernet) that contains the files that
will be installed to generate a working
.Nx
system onto your destination media.
.Pp
Go to the
.Nx*M
Model Support webpage and look up your system.
Take note of the comments about your model and keep these in
mind during the rest of this installation procedure.
