Currently,
.Nx*M
requires the use of
.Tn "Open Firmware"
to boot.
Open Firmware is a command environment using the FORTH language which the
.Nx
kernel uses to gether information about your system, and to control some
of your devices.  It is part of the boot ROMs in most 
.Tn PowerPC Ns No -based Tn Macintosh
systems.  Until late 1996, 
.Tn Apple 
never intended to use Open Firmware for anything other than internal debugging and hardware support.  It was not
intended to be used to boot an operating system.  This is why earlier machines
have so much trouble with Open Firmware.
This also means that PowerMacs and clones that lack Open Firmware cannot boot
.Nx
on the \*M platform. Most machines introduced by Apple and the clone-makers
after August 17, 1995 have Open Firmware and are supported.
.Pp
Apple made several revisions of this Open Firmware environment, and each has
various quirks and problems that we must work around. The single hardest step
of installing
.Nx*M
is to set up Open Firmware properly. Open Firmware versions 1.0.5 and 
2.0.x act
similarly and the same set of instructions applies to them. Open Firmware
version 2.4 is slightly different with regards to booting. Open Firmware
version 3 is altogether different.
.Pp
At present,
.Nx*M
does not support the PPC 601 microprocessor, which means that the
PowerMacintosh 7200 and 7500 models are not supported. The PowerMacintosh
7500 may be upgraded to a PPC 604, G3, or G4 microprocessor via a
daughtercard replacement, in which case
.Nx
will run on this system.
.Pp
The minimal configuration requires 16 MB of RAM and ~80 MB of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended, as
.Nx
with 16 MB of RAM is very slow. Note that until you have
around 32 MB of RAM, getting more RAM is more important than getting a
faster CPU.

.Ss2 Supported boot devices and media
.
Each version of Open Firmware supports different devices and media that you
may boot from.  We define the terms
.Dq "bootable media"
as the media (hard drive, CD-R, ethernet) that will be used to bootstrap
your \*M system into
.Nx No Ns ,
and
.Dq "distribution sets"
or
.Dq "distribution media"
as the media (hard drive, CD-R, ethernet) that contains the files that
will be installed to generate a working 
.Nx
system onto your destination media.
.Pp
Go to the
.Nx*M
Model Support webpage and look up your system. Take note of the comments
about your model and keep these in mind during the rest of this installation
procedure.
