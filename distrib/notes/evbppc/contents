.Ss2 Binary distribution sets
.\"
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.\" XXX: most sets except kern and xserver should be in notes/common
.\"
The
.Nx
\*M
binary distribution sets contain the binaries which
comprise the
.Nx
\*V release for \*M.
The binary distribution sets can be found in the
.Pa \*M/binary/sets
subdirectory
of the
.Nx
\*V
distribution tree, and are as follows:
.(tag xserver \" sets
.
.It Sy base
The
.Nx
\*V
\*M
.Sy base
binary distribution.
You
.Em must
install this distribution set.
It contains the base
.Nx
utilities that are necessary for the
system to run and be minimally functional.
.
.It Sy comp
Things needed for compiling programs.
This set includes the system include files
.Pq Pa /usr/include
and the various system libraries (except the shared
libraries, which are included as part of the
.Sy base
set).
This set also includes the manual pages for
all of the utilities it contains, as well as the
system call and library manual pages.
.
.It Sy debug
This distribution set contains debug information for
all base system utilities.
It is useful when reporting issues with binaries or during
developement.
This set is huge, if the target disk is small, do not install it.
.
.It Sy etc
This distribution set contains the system
configuration files that reside in
.Pa /etc
and in several other places.
This set
.Em must
be installed if you are installing the system from scratch, but should
.Em not
be used if you are upgrading.
.
.It Sy games
This set includes the games and their manual pages.
.
.\" MD kernel set(s) -------------------------------------------------
.
.It Sy kern-EV64260
This set contains a
.Nx*M
\*V
kernel in ELF format named
.Pa /netbsd
and the same kernel in the format needed by the bootloader as
.Pa /netbsd.img .
These kernels are specific to the Marvell EV-64260.
.It Sy kern-EXPLORA451
This set contains a
.Nx*M
\*V
kernel in ELF format named
.Pa /netbsd
and the same kernel in the format needed by the bootloader as
.Pa /netbsd.img .
These kernels are specific to the NCD Explora451 NC.
.It Sy kern-OPENBLOCKS266
This set contains a
.Nx*M
\*V
kernel in ELF format named
.Pa /netbsd
and the same kernel in the format needed by the bootloader as
.Pa /netbsd.img .
These kernels are specific to the Plat'Home OpenBlockS266 microserver.
.It Sy kern-PMPPC
This set contains a
.Nx*M
\*V
kernel in ELF format named
.Pa /netbsd
and the same kernel in the format needed by the bootloader as
.Pa /netbsd.img .
These kernels are specific to Artesyn PM/PPC boards.
.It Sy kern-WALNUT
This set contains a
.Nx*M
\*V
kernel in ELF format named
.Pa /netbsd
and the same kernel in the format needed by the bootloader as
.Pa /netbsd.img .
These kernels are specific to the IBM 405GP based Walnut evaluation board.
.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.
.It Sy man
This set includes all of the manual pages for the
binaries and other software contained in the
.Sy base
set.
Note that it does not include any of the manual pages
that are included in the other sets.
.
.It Sy misc
This set includes the system dictionaries,
the typesettable document set, and other files from
.Pa /usr/share .
.
.It Sy modules
This set includes kernel modules to add functionality to a running system.
.
.It Sy text
This set includes
.Nx Ns 's
text processing tools, including
.Xr groff 1 ,
all related programs, and their manual pages.
.
.tag) \" sets

.
.\" X sets -----------------------------------------------------------
.\" XXX: XOrg vs XFree
.\" XXX: ports without xserver
.Pp
.Nx
maintains its own set of sources for the X Window System in order to
assure tight integration and compatibility.
These sources are based on
X.Org.
Binary sets for the X Window System are distributed with
.Nx .
The sets are:
.(tag xserver \" x sets
.
.It Sy xbase
The basic files needed for a complete X
client environment.
This does not include the X servers.
.
.It Sy xcomp
The extra libraries and include files needed to compile X source code.
.
.It Sy xdebug
This distribution set contains debug information for
all X11 binaries.
It is useful when reporting issues with these binaries or during
developement.
This set is huge, if the target disk is small, do not install it.
.
.It Sy xfont
Fonts needed by the X server and by X clients.
.
.It Sy xetc
Configuration files for X which could be locally modified.
.
.It Sy xserver
The X server.

.
.\" MI DISCUSSION OF BINARY SETS -------------------------------------
.\" XXX: should be in notes/common
.
.Pp
The \*M binary distribution sets are distributed as gzipped tar files
named with the extension
.Sy .tgz ,
e.g.
.Pa base.tgz .
.
.
.Pp
The instructions given for extracting the source sets work equally
well for the binary sets, but it is worth noting that if you use that
method, the filenames stored in the sets are relative and therefore
the files are extracted
.Em below the current directory .
Therefore, if you want to extract the binaries into your system, i.e.
replace the system binaries with them, you have to run the
.Ic "tar -xzpf"
command from the root directory (
.Pa /
) of your system.
