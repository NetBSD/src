.Nx*M
is a port of
.Nx
to PowerPC based evaluation board.
At the present time, the IBM PowerPC 405GP based walnut evaluation board
is the only board supported by this port.
As a result, this documentation is specific to installing
.Nx*M
on that particular piece of hardware.
More evaluation boards will be added in due course, and this documentation
will be updated accordingly.

.(bullet -offset indent
Ethernet:
The built-in Ethernet card is not supported, so another PCI
Ethernet card supported by
.Nx
must be provided if you want to use
.Nx*M
on a network.
Any PCI Ethernet card supported by
.Nx
should work.
.It
SCSI:
Any PCI SCSI card supported by
.Nx
should work, as should most SCSI disk/tape/CD-ROM devices.

.Em Note :
This does not concern booting the kernel itself, since that
is done by the firmware.
For using an NFS root you will have to provide a supported network card,
though.

.Ss2 Supported boot devices and media
.
The firmware only supports booting from network or the serial port,
so you cannot boot from disk even if you install a disk controller.
Instructions for booting from serial port are not provided; in the
following we will describe how to setup netbooting.
.Pp
The first step is setting the IP addresses of both the walnut itself
and the host that will be serving the kernel image.
From the main menu, choose 3 to set the IP address of the machine:
.(disp
  1 - Enable/disable tests
  2 - Enable/disable boot devices
  3 - Change IP addresses
  4 - Ping test
  5 - Toggle ROM monitor debugger
  6 - Toggle automatic menu
  7 - Display configuration
  8 - Save changes to configuration
  9 - Set baud rate for s1 boot
  A - Enable/disable I cache (Enabled )
  B - Enable/disable D cache (Enabled )
  0 - Exit menu and continue
-> 3
.disp)
.Pp
Set the IP address for the local Ethernet with 1:
.(disp
---   CHANGE IP ADDRESS   ---
 Device List:
   001  Enabled   Ethernet      [ENET]
                  local=0.0.0.0  remote=0.0.0.0  hwaddr=0004ace312bd
   004  Disabled  Serial Port 2 [S2]
                  local=8.1.1.2  remote=255.255.255.255  hwaddr=ffffffffffff
 ----------------------------
select device to change ->1
  1 - Change local address
  2 - Change remote address
  0 - Return to main menu
->1
Current IP address = (0.0.0.0)
Enter new IP address ->Enter IP address in dot notation, (eg. 8.1.1.2)
.disp)
.Pp
Here you enter the machine's IP address, e.g. 10.0.0.1.
Now you need to do the same thing to set the host IP address (choice 2
from the menu above).
.Pp
Once both the local and remote addresses are set, you can use
the ping test to make sure the ethernet is working; or you can
simply use option 0, "Exit menu and continue" to try to boot the
machine, if you already set up the remote machine to provide
a kernel image.
For details on how to do that, see the
.Sx Booting from the network
section below.
.Pp
You should now be able to boot the operating system.
