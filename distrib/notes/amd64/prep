It is strongly recommended that as part of the installation procedure, you
upgrade your system's BIOS to the latest version available from your system
vendor.
Later BIOSes often contain workarounds for CPU and chipset bugs,
workarounds that cannot be provided by the operating system.
.Pp
In the past, bugs fixed this way have been known to cause unpredictable
behaviour and frequent system crashes with
.Nx
and other
.Ul
operating systems on x86 hardware.

.Ss "Semi-manually installing on UEFI systems"
Unfortunately the
.Nx
installer does not properly support installation on machines using
.Sy UEFI
firmware or when targetting disks with more than 2 TB size.
A semi-manual mode of installation is supported and quite painless.
This shortcoming will be addressesed in the upcoming next release.

Please refer to

when installing on
.Sy UEFI
systems. See this

for expert / manual installation suggestions on modern disk systems.
