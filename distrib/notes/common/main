fetch the pair of boot floppy images
.Pa macppc/installation/floppy/boot1.fs
and
.Pa macppc/installation/floppy/boot2.fs ,
which include the bootloader and installation kernel.
For systems without floppy drives (most are Open Firmware 3), fetch the

the installation program
can fetch these files for you (using, e.g., ftp)
if you have a network connection.
There are several other methods to get the binary sets onto
your machine.

Write the boot images
.Pp
Many commercial and freeware programs are available to burn CD-ROMs.
.Pp
If installing via USB, you must first uncompress the USB image, which
is gzipped.
.Dl $ Ic "gunzip NetBSD-\*V-\*M-install.img.gz"
Next, write the USB image to a USB stick/drive.
Note that this will overwrite any existing data on the device that you
specify, so double check the device before running!
On
.Ul
operating systems, use a command similar to the following,
replacing
.Pa /dev/rsd0d
with the appropriate device for your system:
.Dl # Ic "dd if=NetBSD-\*V-\*M-install.img of=/dev/rsd0d bs=32k"
On Windows, you will need to use a program such as Win32 Disk Imager,
which can be found at
.Lk http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/
.if \n[amd64]:\n[i386] \{\
If you have problems writing a raw image to a floppy,
the
.Ic rawrite.exe
MS-DOS program
or the

in the

on a drive partitioned with the installation tools, you must partition
your disk before running the installer, then select the
.Dq Me "Re-install sets or install additional sets"
option in the installer (selecting the
.Dq Me "Install NetBSD to hard disk"
or
.Dq Me "Upgrade NetBSD on a hard disk"
options will render your drive unbootable).
If you are unsure, you may want to read the section below on

keys after the boot chime starts, but before the chime ends.
Entering Open Firmware versions prior to 3 is usually the most frustrating
part of installation \(em you may want to read the section below on

For the install kernel and bootloader on your hard drive (Open Firmware
3), the command is
.Dq Ic "boot hd:,\eofwboot.xcf netbsd-GENERIC_MD.gz" .

For boot CDs, the command is something like
.Dq Ic "boot cd:,\eofwboot.xcf netbsd.macppc"
(for Open Firmware 3) or
.Dq Ic "boot scsi-int/sd@3:0 NETBSD.MACPPC"
(for earlier Open Firmware versions).
You will need to use the correct case for

file system.
You may need to replace
.Ic cd
with
.Ic "scsi/sd@3 , scsi-int/sd@3 , ata/atapi-disk ,"
or some other device alias.

Operating System is a fully functional
.Tn Open Source
.Ul
operating system derived from the University of California, Berkeley
Networking Release 2 (Net/2), 4.4BSD-Lite, and 4.4BSD-Lite2 sources.
.Nx
runs on many different different system architectures (ports)
across a variety of distinct CPU families, and is being ported to more.
The
.Nx
\*V release contains complete binary releases for most of these
system architectures, with preliminary support for the others included in
source form.
Please see the
.Nx
website at
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/
for information on them.)
.Pp
.Nx
is a completely integrated system.
In addition to its highly portable, high performance kernel,
.nh
.Nx
features a complete set of user utilities, compilers for several
languages, the X Window System, firewall software
and numerous other tools, all accompanied by full source code.
.Pp
.\" XXX Should we include some text here about NetBSD's license
.\" policies and how commercial-friendly it is?
.Nx
is a creation of the members of the Internet community.
Without the unique cooperation and coordination the net makes
possible,

The
.Nx
\*V release
provides many significant changes, including support for many new
devices, hundreds of bug fixes, new and updated kernel subsystems, and
numerous userland enhancements.

\*V.
.Pp
Note that

will automatically invoke
.(disp

and thus all issues that are fixed by
.Ic postinstall
by default will be handled.

A number of things have been removed from the

\*V release.
See the
.Dq Components removed from NetBSD
section near the beginning of this document for a list.
.if \n[arm] \{\
.Ss2 Important note regarding ABI change on ARM ports
.Pp
In
.Nx
7.0, most ARM ports (all but acorn32, and epoc32) have switched
to the official standard ABI
.Pq EABI5
which is recommended by ARM for ELF binaries.
.Pp
Backwards compatibility is provided for binaries using the previous ABI
.Pq oabi .
A
.Nx
\*V
kernel with the
.Dv COMPAT_NETBSD32
option enabled will allow you to execute oabi binaries.
This option is enabled in the kernels distributed with this release.
.Pp
However, new binaries can not be mixed with old libraries, and shared
libraries are incompatible.
.Pp
.Ic sysinst
does not provide an automatic mechanism to partlially upgrade an old
installation.
There are two ways to handle the transition:
.(enum
.Pp
Do a complete update.
.Pp
This means updating your system with
.Ic sysinst ,
then deleting and recompiling all other binaries, whether they were
installed locally or through pkgsrc.
This is the preferred, cleanest approach.
.It
Move your old binaries and libraries to
.Pa /compat/netbsd32
and replace them one by one.
.Pp
For example, move all of
.Pa /usr/pkg
to
.Pa /compat/netbsd32/usr/pkg
and add
.Pa /compat/netbsd32/usr/pkg/bin
to the end of your PATH.
Most binaries should still run, and can be replaced over time with
recompiled packages, which will install to
.Pa /usr/pkg
again.

command shipped with
.Nx ,
and fill in as much information about the problem as you can.
Good bug reports include lots of details.
.Pp
Bugs also can be submitted and queried with the web interface at
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/support/send-pr.html
.Pp
There are also port-specific mailing lists, to discuss aspects of
each port of
.Nx .
Use majordomo to find their addresses, or visit
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/mailinglists/
.Pp
If
you're interested in doing a serious amount of work on a specific
port, you probably should contact the
.Sq owner
of that port (listed

As a favor, please avoid mailing huge documents or files to these
mailing lists.
Instead, put the material you would have sent up for FTP or WWW somewhere,
then mail the appropriate list about it.
If you'd rather not do that, mail the list saying you'll send the data to
those who want it.

for their work on
.Bx
systems, support, and encouragement.
.It
The Internet Systems Consortium, Inc. for hosting the
.Nx
FTP, CVS, AnonCVS, mail, mail archive, GNATS, SUP, Rsync and WWW servers.
.It
The Internet Research Institute in Japan for hosting the server
which runs the CVSweb interface to the
.Nx
source tree.
.It
The Columbia University Computer Science Department for hosting
the build cluster.
.It
The many organizations that provide
.Nx
mirror sites.
.It
Without CVS, this project would be impossible to manage, so our hats
go off to Brian Berliner, Jeff Polk, and the various other people
who've had a hand in making CVS a useful tool.
.It
We list the individuals and organizations
that have made donations or loans of hardware and/or money, to support
.Nx
development, and deserve credit for it at
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/donations/
(If you're not on that list and should be, tell us!
We probably were not able to get in touch with you, to verify that you
wanted to be listed.)
.It
Finally, we thank all of the people who've put sweat and tears into
developing
.Nx
since its inception in January, 1993.
(Obviously, there are a lot more people who deserve thanks here.
If you're one of them, and would like to be mentioned, tell us!)
