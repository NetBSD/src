	To "regenerate" this file, go up one level to src/distrib/notes
	and type "make".  This will create
	src/distrib/notes/<arch>/INSTALL.*.

	We keep most of the notes the same on HEAD and release branches,
	but some of this are not appropriate for HEAD/current. Also
	some locations differ for actual release, so we distinguish
	between:

	RELEASE_BRANCH == 1
		this is on a release branch (not -current)
	RELEASE_BRANCH == 0
		this is current, not yet branched
	FOR_RELEASE == 1
		this is an official release (will be signed and placed
		on ftp/cdn)
	FOR_RELEASE == 0
		this is a local build or a "daily" build on the build
		cluster

if you have a network connection.
There are several other methods to get the binary sets onto

You will at a minimum need

Many commercial and freeware programs are available to burn CD-ROMs.

If installing via USB, you must first uncompress the USB image, which
is gzipped.

Note the \*M architecture has two images, NetBSD-\*V-\*M-install.img.gz

.\}
.Dl $ Ic "gunzip NetBSD-\*V-\*M-install.img.gz"
Next, write the USB image to a USB stick/drive.
Note that this will overwrite any existing data on the device that you
specify, so double check the device before running!
On
.Ul
operating systems, use a command similar to the following,
replacing
.Pa /dev/rsd0d
with the appropriate device for your system:
.Dl # Ic "dd if=NetBSD-\*V-\*M-install.img of=/dev/rsd0d bs=32k"
On Windows, you will need to use a program such as

languages, the X Window System, firewall software
and numerous other tools, all accompanied by full source code.

All the above source sets are located in the

are of primary interest: user commands are in section 1, file formats
are in section 5, and administrative information is in section 8.
.Pp
.No The Em man
command is used to view the documentation on a topic, and is
started by entering
.Ic man
.Op Ar section
.Ar topic .
The brackets
.Op \&
around the
section should not be entered, but rather indicate that the section is
optional.
If you don't ask for a particular section, the topic with the
lowest numbered section name will be displayed.
For instance, after logging in, enter
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "man passwd"
.Pp
to read the documentation for
.Xr passwd 1 .
To view the documentation for
.Xr passwd 5 ,
enter
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "man 5 passwd"
.Pp
instead.

If you are unsure of what man page you are looking for, enter
.Pp
.Dl # Ic apropos Ar subject-word

where
.Ar subject-word
is your topic of interest; a list of possibly
related man pages will be displayed.
