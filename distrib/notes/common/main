This section contains some brief notes describing what you need to
install
.Nx
\*V on a machine of the \*M architecture.
.Bl -bullet
.It
Fetch files needed to install
.Nx .
.if \n[i386]:\n[amd64] \{\
.Pp
Option 1: bootable CD-ROM images containing the full distribution.
.Pp
These can be found
on an FTP site near you, usually located in the
.Pa /pub/NetBSD/iso/
directory.
Check the NetBSD website for details.
.Pp
Option 2: bootable CD-ROM images from
.Pa \*M/installation/cdrom/ .
.Pp
These images are bootable, but do not contain binary sets.
They are intended for network installs or system repair.
.Pa boot.iso
is for VGA console installation, and
.Pa boot-com.iso
is for installation over serial console (com0, 9600 baud).
.Pp
Option 3: boot floppy images from
.Pa \*M/installation/floppy/ .
.Pp
.Pa boot1.fs
and
.Pa boot2.fs
are floppy images for VGA console installation.
.Pa boot-com1.fs
and
.Pa boot-com2.fs
are for installation via serial console (com0, 9600 baud).
.It
The default kernel on CD-ROMs has ACPI enabled.
This is known to cause issues on a few machines which have buggy ACPI
implementations.
.Pp
To boot with ACPI disabled, choose the "no ACPI" option from the boot menu,
or interrupt the menu and enter the
.Nx
boot prompt.
Type 
.Ic boot -2
to boot with ACPI disabled.
.\} \" amd64:i386
.if \n[macppc] \{\
The files depend on which model you
are using and how you plan to boot your machine.
For systems with built-in floppy drives (Open Firmware 1 or 2), 
fetch the pair of boot floppy images
.Pa macppc/installation/floppy/boot1.fs
and
.Pa macppc/installation/floppy/boot2.fs ,
which include the bootloader and installation kernel.
For systems without floppy drives (most are Open Firmware 3), fetch the
bootloader
.Pa macppc/installation/ofwboot.xcf
and the installation kernel
.Pa macppc/binary/kernel/netbsd-GENERIC_MD.gz .
If you have a CD-R, you can fetch the CD image,
.Pa macppccd-\*V.iso .
.\}
.if \n[sparc] \{\
Fetch a CD image,
.Pa sparccd-\*V.iso
or the floppy disk images,
.Pa sparc/install/floppy/disk1.gz No and Pa sparc/install/floppy/disk2 .
You need either the pair of floppies or the CD to boot your system.
.\}
.if \n[sparc64] \{\
This is either a CD image,
.Pa sparc64cd-\*V.iso
or the installation kernel and bootloader,
.Pa sparc64/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.gz No and Pa sparc64/installation/misc/ofwboot
which can be booted from a
.Tn Solaris
or
.Nx
partition.
.\}
.if \n[macppc]:\n[sparc]:\n[sparc64] \{\
Alternatively, you may netboot the installation kernel.  This process is
covered below, in detail.

The actual binary distribution is in the
.Pa \*M/binary/sets/
directory.
When you boot the install
.if \n[i386] CD-ROM or floppies,
.if \n[macppc] kernel from floppies, hard drive, or CD-ROM,
.if \n[sparc] floppies or CD-ROM,
.if \n[sparc64] CD-ROM or installation kernel,
the installation program
can fetch these files for you (using e.g. ftp)
if you have a network connection.
There are several other methods to get the binary sets onto
your machine.
.Pp
You will at a minimum need
.ie \n[i386]:\n[amd64] \{\
one of the kernel sets, typically
.Pa kern-GENERIC.tgz ,
as well as
.\}
.el \{\
the following sets:
.Pa kern-GENERIC.tgz , 
.\}
.Pa base.tgz
and
.Pa etc.tgz .
In a typical workstation installation you will probably want
all the installation sets.
.ie \n[i386]:\n[amd64] \{\
.It
Write the CD-ROM images or floppy images out.
.Pp
Many commercial and freeware programs are available to burn CD-ROMs.
.Pp
If you have problems writing a raw image to a floppy,
the
.Ic rawrite.exe
MS-DOS program
or the
.Ic Rawrite32
Windows32 program (installed by
.Pa rawr32.exe )
in the
.Pa i386/installation/misc/
directory may be of help.
.\}
.if \n[macppc] \{\
.It
If your \*M has a floppy drive, create the pair of boot floppies using 
.Ic suntar
(MacOS 9),
.Ic rawrite
(Windows), or
.Ic dd
(any
.Ul
system with floppy support).  If your system has Open Firmware 3, drag
.Pa ofwboot.xcf No and Pa netbsd-GENERIC_MD.gz
to your hard drive icon (the top level of the drive, not the desktop).
If you are using the CD image, burn it now.
.\}
.if \n[sparc] \{\
.It
Make sure your sparc's CD-ROM drive is bootable.
Burn the CD.
Otherwise, write the floppy images directly to a pair of floppies
(after uncompressing disk1.gz).

Burn the CD or put the installation kernel and bootloader 
at the root level of a bootable

At present,
.Nx*M
cannot exist on the same hard drive as
.Tn Mac OS
unless you partition your disk before running the installer.
Open Firmware versions prior to 3 require a dedicated
.Nx
drive \(em you must use the entire disk,
partitioned with the installation tools.
Open Firmware version 3 cannot boot into
.Nx
on a drive partitioned with the installation tools, you must partition
your disk before running the installer, then select the
.Dq Me "Re-install sets or install additional sets"
option in the installer (selecting the
.Dq Me "Install NetBSD to hard disk"
or
.Dq Me "Upgrade NetBSD on a hard disk"
options will render your drive unbootable).
If you are unsure, you may want to read the section below on
.Sx Partitioning your hard drive for NetBSD
.It
For systems with Open Firmware versions prior to 3, you may need to use
Apple's System Disk utility to enter Open Firmware and use your screen and
keyboard.
To enter Open Firmware, hold down the
.Key COMMAND-OPTION-O-F
keys after the boot chime starts, but before the chime ends.
Entering Open Firmware versions prior to 3 is usually the most frustrating
part of installation \(em you may want to read the section below on
.Sx Older Open Firmware System Preparation
.Pp
You should have the Open Firmware
.Dq Pa "0 \*[Gt]"
prompt on your screen before attempting to boot
.Nx*M .
.\}
.if \n[macppc] \{\
.It
At the Open Firmware prompt, type the command to boot.
To boot from the installation floppies, the command is
.Dq Ic "boot fd:0" .
For the install kernel and bootloader on your hard drive (Open Firmware
3), the command is
.Dq Ic "boot hd:,\eofwboot.xcf netbsd-GENERIC_MD.gz" .
.Pp
For boot CDs, the command is something like
.Dq Ic "boot cd:,\eofwboot.xcf netbsd.macppc"
(for Open Firmware 3) or
.Dq Ic "boot scsi-int/sd@3:0 NETBSD.MACPPC"
(for earlier Open Firmware versions).
You will need to use the correct case for
.Ic OFWBOOT.XCF No and Ic NETBSD.MACPPC
depending on how your version of Open Firmware interprets the ISO
file system.
You may need to replace
.Ic cd
with
.Ic "scsi/sd@3 , scsi-int/sd@3 , ata/atapi-disk ,"
or some other device alias.
You should also use the Open Firmware
.Ic dir
command to confirm that the
.Nx*M
kernel is called
.Pa NETBSD.MACPPC .

The command to boot from floppy is either
.Dq Ic boot fd(,,1)

.Dq Ic "boot disk:a /ofwboot -a" .

.\}
.Ss "What is NetBSD?"
.Pp
.
The
.Nx
Operating System is a fully functional
.Tn Open Source
.Ul
operating system derived from the University of California, Berkeley
Networking Release 2 (Net/2), 4.4BSD-Lite, and 4.4BSD-Lite2 sources.
.Nx
runs on 57 different system architectures (ports)
across 15 distinct CPU families, and is being ported to more.
The
.Nx
\*V release contains complete binary releases for many different
system architectures.
(A few ports are not fully supported at this time 
and are thus not part of the binary distribution.
Please see the
.Nx
web site at
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/
for information on them.)
.Pp
.Nx
is a completely integrated system.
In addition to its highly portable, high performance kernel,
.nh
.Nx
features a complete set of user utilities, compilers for several
languages, the X Window System, firewall software
and numerous other tools, all accompanied by full source code.
.Pp
.\" XXX Should we include some text here about NetBSD's license
.\" policies and how commercial-friendly it is?
.Nx
is a creation of the members of the Internet community.
Without the unique cooperation and coordination the net makes
possible, it's likely that
.Nx
wouldn't exist.
.
.Ss "Dedication"
.Pp
.
.Nx
5.1 is dedicated to the memory of Martti Kuparinen, who
was the victim of a traffic accident in June 2010.
.Pp
Martti's technical contributions are too many to list here in full.
He created and maintained numerous packages in pkgsrc, updated two
packet filter solutions distributed with
.Nx
and improved several
hardware drivers. Beyond that he was always helpful and friendly. His
example encouraged users to contribute to the project and share their
work with the community. Some of these users later became
.Nx
developers themselves thanks to Martti's efforts.

.Ss Changes Between the NetBSD 5.0 and 5.1 Releases
.Pp
The
.Nx
\*V
release is the first feature update of the NetBSD 5.0 release branch.
It represents a selected subset of fixes deemed critical for security or
stability reasons, as well as new features and enhancements.
.Pp
Please note that all fixes in security/critical updates (i.e., NetBSD 5.0.1,
5.0.2, etc.) are cumulative, so the latest update contains all such fixes
since the corresponding minor release.
These fixes also appear in minor releases (i.e., NetBSD 5.1, 5.2, etc.).

.Pp
In addition to the files and directories listed above, there is one
directory per architecture, for each of the architectures for which
.Nx
\*V has a binary distribution.
.Pp
The source distribution sets can be found in subdirectories of the
.Pa source
subdirectory of the distribution tree.
They contain the complete sources to the system.
The source distribution sets are as follows:
.(tag sharesrc
.It Sy gnusrc
This set contains the
.Dq gnu
sources, including the source for the compiler, assembler, groff,
and the other GNU utilities in the binary distribution sets.
.showsize 79 450
.It Sy sharesrc
This set contains the
.Dq share
sources, which include the sources for the man pages not associated
with any particular program; the sources for the typesettable document
set; the dictionaries; and more.
.showsize 7 32
.It Sy src

.Xr config 1
utility.
.showsize 34 197
.It Sy xsrc
This set contains the sources to the X Window System.
.showsize 127 694
.tag)
.Pp
All the above source sets are located in the
.Pa source/sets
subdirectory of the distribution tree.
.Pp
The source sets are distributed as compressed tar files.
Except for the
.Sy pkgsrc 
set, which is traditionally unpacked into
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc ,
all sets may be unpacked into
.Pa /usr/src
with the command:
.Dl # Ic "cd / ; tar -zxpf set_name.tgz"
.Pp
In each of the source distribution set directories, there are
files which contain the checksums of the files in the directory:
.(tag SHA512 -offset indent
.It Li MD5
.Tn MD5
digests in the format produced by the command:
.br
.Ic cksum -a MD5 Ar file .
.It Li SHA512
.Tn SHA512
digests in the format produced by the command:
.br
.Ic cksum -a SHA512 Ar file .

The SHA512 digest is safer, but MD5 checksums are provided so that a wider
range of operating systems can check the integrity of the release files.

.Ss "Compatibility Issues With Previous NetBSD Releases"
.Pp
.
Users upgrading from previous versions of
.Nx
may wish to bear the
following problems and compatibility issues in mind when upgrading to
.Nx
\*V.
.Pp
If your port uses X.Org and you see messages from the X server indicating
that no devices were found, you may need to run
.Ic "X -configure"
and update your existing xorg.conf to use the BusID line from the
newly-generated config file.
.Pp
Dual-head support for PC systems has become broken for many configurations
with the update to xorg-server 1.6.x, which has removed the userland PCI
configuration mechanism, and needs to rely upon the OS.
We hope to correct this for future releases.
Workaround: The only workaround is non-trivial and requires programming
several PCI BAR registers as they previously were in NetBSD 5.0.
.Pp
If you are updating to
.Nx
\*V
without the aid of sysinst or postinstall and your port uses X.Org, be sure
to remove
.Pa /usr/X11R7/lib/X11/xkb/symbols/pc
before extracting the xbase set.
In the version of X.Org shipped with 5.0, this was a directory, but in more
recent X.Org versions it is a file.
.if \n[i386]:\n[macppc]:\n[sparc]:\n[sparc64]:\n[amd64]:\n[sgimips] \{\
.Pp
On ports using X.Org, libpixman and libXfont had their major versions bumped.
This can be a source of trouble if using binary packages built on 5.0.x with
a clean install of \*V (upgrades from 5.0.x will include both old and new
versions of libpixman and libXfont).
Compatibility packages have been prepared and are available from:
.Lk ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/\*M/5.0/emulators/compat50-5.1.tgz
(or a convenient mirror).
This URL can be passed directly to the
.Xr pkg_add 1
command.
.\}
.Pp
pkg_install now depends on the pkgdb cache for automatic conflict detection.
It is recommended to rebuild the cache with
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "pkg_admin rebuild"
.Pp
.Xr audit-packages.conf 5
has been superseded by
.Xr pkg_install.conf 5 .
The default configuration is the same.
.Pp
Support for
.Xr pkg_view 1
has been retired.
.Pp
The functionality of
.Xr audit-packages 1
and
.Xr download-vulnerability-list 1
has moved into
.Xr pkg_admin 1 .
However, wrapper scripts that handle the common use cases are provided.
.Ss2 Issues when running older binaries on NetBSD \*V
.Pp
The pthread libraries from previous versions of
.Nx
require that the
.Xr sysctl 3
node
.Dv kern.no_sa_support
be set to
.Dv 0 .
This affects the following environments:
.(bullet
Running a 5.x kernel with an older userland.
.It
Running an older userland inside a chroot'ed environment on a 5.x system.
.It
Running older statically linked pthread applications.
.bullet)
.Pp
The 5.x kernel defaults to
.Dv 0
for 
.Dv kern.no_sa_support ,
which covers the first case.
However, please note that a full installation of 5.x
.Pq either from scratch or through an upgrade
will set
.Dv kern.no_sa_support
to 1 during the boot process.
This means that for the last two cases, you will have to manually set
.Dv kern.no_sa_support
to
.Dv 0 ,
using either the
.Xr sysctl 8
command or through
.Xr sysctl.conf 5 .
.Pp
Note that
.Ic sysinst
will automatically invoke
.(disp
postinstall fix
.disp)
and thus all issues that are fixed by
.Ic postinstall
by default (see below) will be handled.
.
.Ss2 Issues affecting an upgrade from NetBSD 3.x releases
See the section below on upgrading from NetBSD 4.x as well.
.Pp
The following issues can generally be resolved by running
.Em postinstall
with the
.Sy etc

.Sq uucp

.It
A number of things were removed in the
.Nx
4.0
release, including: the evbsh5 port, the Fortran 77 compiler (g77), NETCCITT,
NETNS, Sendmail, Sushi, UUCP, and Vinum.  If you were using any of these,
please see the "Components removed from NetBSD" at
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/releases/formal-4/NetBSD-4.0.html#removals
.It
The replacement of Sendmail by Postfix can be handled automatically by
.Em postinstall
but it is not done by default.
If you want to transition to Postfix, the command
.(disp
postinstall -s /path/to/etc.tgz fix mailerconf
.disp)
will update your
.Pa /etc/mailer.conf
file to use Postfix as the MTA. When using
.Ic sysinst
to upgrade the system, it will ask if you want this to be done.
.Pp
Note that if you have a customized
Sendmail setup, you need to set up Postfix in an equivalent way; there
is no tool for automatic conversion of Sendmail configuration to a
Postfix one.
.Pp
Postfix will be started automatically when the system boots.
You may see messages like "$sendmail is not set properly" at boot.
You can suppress them by removing
.Pa /etc/rc.d/sendmail
and
.Pa /etc/rc.d/smmsp .
Those files and other parts of sendmail configuration like files under
.Pa /usr/share/sendmail
are not removed by default
while upgrading for those who want to continue using sendmail from
outside the base system.
If you want to delete them,
.Em postinstall
can be used:
.(disp
postinstall -s /path/to/etc.tgz fix sendmail
.disp)

Previously, these options were automatically enforced even if they
were not explicitly specified.
.It
A number of things have been removed from the
.Nx
\*V release.
See the "Components removed from NetBSD" section near the beginning of
this document for a list.

.
.Ss "Using online NetBSD documentation"
.Pp
Documentation is available if you installed the manual
distribution set.
Traditionally, the
.Dq man pages
(documentation) are denoted by
.Sq Li name(section) .
Some examples of this are
.Pp
.(bullet -compact -offset indent
.Xr intro 1 ,
.It
.Xr man 1 ,
.It
.Xr apropos 1 ,
.It
.Xr passwd 1 ,
and
.It
.Xr passwd 5 .
.bullet)
.Pp
The section numbers group the topics into several categories, but three
are of primary interest: user commands are in section 1, file formats
are in section 5, and administrative information is in section 8.
.Pp
.No The Em man
command is used to view the documentation on a topic, and is
started by entering
.Ic man
.Op Ar section
.Ar topic .
The brackets
.Op \&
around the
section should not be entered, but rather indicate that the section is
optional.
If you don't ask for a particular section, the topic with the
lowest numbered section name will be displayed.
For instance, after logging in, enter
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "man passwd"
.Pp
to read the documentation for
.Xr passwd 1 .
To view the documentation for
.Xr passwd 5 ,
enter
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "man 5 passwd"
.Pp
instead.
.Pp
If you are unsure of what man page you are looking for, enter
.Pp
.Dl # Ic apropos Ar subject-word
.Pp
where
.Ar subject-word
is your topic of interest; a list of possibly
related man pages will be displayed.
