The files depend on which model you

fetch the pair of boot floppy images

and

For systems without floppy drives (most are Open Firmware 3), fetch the

Alternatively, you may netboot the installation kernel.  This process is

There are several other methods to get the binary sets onto
your machine.

.Pa kern-GENERIC.tgz ,
as well as
.\}
.el \{\
the following sets:

Write the boot images
.Pp
Many commercial and freeware programs are available to burn CD-ROMs.
.Pp
If installing via USB, you must first uncompress the USB image, which
is gzipped.
.Dl $ Ic "gunzip NetBSD-\*V-\*M-install.img.gz"
Next, write the USB image to a USB stick/drive.
Note that this will overwrite any existing data on the device that you
specify, so double check the device before running!
On
.Ul
operating systems, use a command similar to the following,
replacing
.Pa /dev/rsd0d
with the appropriate device for your system:
.Dl # Ic "dd if=NetBSD-\*V-\*M-install.img of=/dev/rsd0d bs=32k"
On Windows, you will need to use a program such as Win32 Disk Imager,
which can be found at

or
Rawrite32 which can be found at
.Lk https://www.NetBSD.org/~martin/rawrite32 .

At present,

Open Firmware versions prior to 3 require a dedicated

Open Firmware version 3 cannot boot into

on a drive partitioned with the installation tools, you must partition
your disk before running the installer, then select the

option in the installer (selecting the
.Dq Me "Install NetBSD to hard disk"
or
.Dq Me "Upgrade NetBSD on a hard disk"
options will render your drive unbootable).
If you are unsure, you may want to read the section below on

For systems with Open Firmware versions prior to 3, you may need to use

keyboard.
To enter Open Firmware, hold down the

keys after the boot chime starts, but before the chime ends.
Entering Open Firmware versions prior to 3 is usually the most frustrating
part of installation \(em you may want to read the section below on

At the Open Firmware prompt, type the command to boot.
To boot from the installation floppies, the command is

For the install kernel and bootloader on your hard drive (Open Firmware
3), the command is
.Dq Ic "boot hd:,\eofwboot.xcf netbsd-GENERIC_MD.gz" .

For boot CDs, the command is something like
.Dq Ic "boot cd:,\eofwboot.xcf netbsd.macppc"
(for Open Firmware 3) or
.Dq Ic "boot scsi-int/sd@3:0 NETBSD.MACPPC"
(for earlier Open Firmware versions).
You will need to use the correct case for

depending on how your version of Open Firmware interprets the ISO
file system.
You may need to replace
.Ic cd
with
.Ic "scsi/sd@3 , scsi-int/sd@3 , ata/atapi-disk ,"
or some other device alias.

.Ul
operating system derived from the University of California, Berkeley
Networking Release 2 (Net/2), 4.4BSD-Lite, and 4.4BSD-Lite2 sources.
.Nx
runs on many different different system architectures (ports)
across a variety of distinct CPU families, and is being ported to more.
The
.Nx
\*V release contains complete binary releases for most of these
system architectures, with preliminary support for the others included in
source form.
Please see the
.Nx
website at
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/
for information on them.)
.Pp
.Nx
is a completely integrated system.
In addition to its highly portable, high performance kernel,
.nh
.Nx
features a complete set of user utilities, compilers for several
languages, the X Window System, firewall software
and numerous other tools, all accompanied by full source code.
.Pp
.\" XXX Should we include some text here about NetBSD's license
.\" policies and how commercial-friendly it is?
.Nx
is a creation of the members of the Internet community.
Without the unique cooperation and coordination the net makes

.Ss2 Important note regarding ABI change on ARM ports
.Pp
In
.Nx
7.0, most ARM ports (all but acorn32, and epoc32) have switched
to the official standard ABI
.Pq EABI5
which is recommended by ARM for ELF binaries.
.Pp
Backwards compatibility is provided for binaries using the previous ABI
.Pq oabi .
A
.Nx
\*V
kernel with the
.Dv COMPAT_NETBSD32
option enabled will allow you to execute oabi binaries.
This option is enabled in the kernels distributed with this release.
.Pp
However, new binaries can not be mixed with old libraries, and shared
libraries are incompatible.
.Pp
.Ic sysinst
does not provide an automatic mechanism to partlially upgrade an old
installation.
There are two ways to handle the transition:
.(enum
.Pp
Do a complete update.
.Pp
This means updating your system with
.Ic sysinst ,
then deleting and recompiling all other binaries, whether they were
installed locally or through pkgsrc.
This is the preferred, cleanest approach.
.It
Move your old binaries and libraries to
.Pa /compat/netbsd32
and replace them one by one.
.Pp
For example, move all of
.Pa /usr/pkg
to
.Pa /compat/netbsd32/usr/pkg
and add
.Pa /compat/netbsd32/usr/pkg/bin
to the end of your PATH.
Most binaries should still run, and can be replaced over time with
recompiled packages, which will install to

Good bug reports include lots of details.
.Pp
Bugs also can be submitted and queried with the web interface at
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/support/send-pr.html
.Pp
There are also port-specific mailing lists, to discuss aspects of
each port of
.Nx .
Use majordomo to find their addresses, or visit
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/mailinglists/
.Pp
If
you're interested in doing a serious amount of work on a specific
port, you probably should contact the
.Sq owner
of that port (listed
below).
.Pp
If you'd like to help with
.Nx ,
and have an idea as to how you could be useful, send us mail or subscribe to:
.Mt netbsd-users@NetBSD.org .
.Pp
As a favor, please avoid mailing huge documents or files to these
mailing lists.
Instead, put the material you would have sent up for FTP or WWW somewhere,
then mail the appropriate list about it.
If you'd rather not do that, mail the list saying you'll send the data to
those who want it.

for their work on

systems, support, and encouragement.
.It
The Internet Systems Consortium, Inc. for hosting the
.Nx
FTP, CVS, AnonCVS, mail, mail archive, GNATS, SUP, Rsync and WWW servers.
.It
The Internet Research Institute in Japan for hosting the server
which runs the CVSweb interface to the
.Nx
source tree.
.It
The Columbia University Computer Science Department for hosting
the build cluster.
.It
The many organizations that provide
.Nx
mirror sites.
.It
Without CVS, this project would be impossible to manage, so our hats
go off to Brian Berliner, Jeff Polk, and the various other people
who've had a hand in making CVS a useful tool.
.It
We list the individuals and organizations
that have made donations or loans of hardware and/or money, to support
.Nx
development, and deserve credit for it at
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/donations/
(If you're not on that list and should be, tell us!
We probably were not able to get in touch with you, to verify that you
wanted to be listed.)
.It
Finally, we thank all of the people who've put sweat and tears into
developing
.Nx
since its inception in January, 1993.
(Obviously, there are a lot more people who deserve thanks here.
If you're one of them, and would like to be mentioned, tell us!)
