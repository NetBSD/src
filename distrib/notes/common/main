This section contains some brief notes describing what you need to
install
.Nx
\*V on a machine of the \*M architecture.
.Bl -bullet
.It
Fetch files needed to install
.Nx .
.if \n[i386]:\n[amd64] \{\
.Pp
Option 1: bootable CD-ROM images or USB memstick images containing the
full distribution.
.Pp
These can be found
on an FTP site near you, usually located in the
.Pa /pub/NetBSD/iso/
directory.
Check the list of
.Nx
mirrors at
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/mirrors
for details.
.Pp
Option 2: bootable CD-ROM images from
.Pa \*M/installation/cdrom/ .
.Pp
These images are bootable, but do not contain binary sets.
They are intended for network installs or system repair.
.Pa boot.iso
is for VGA console installation, and
.Pa boot-com.iso
is for installation over serial console (com0, 9600 baud).
.Pp
Option 3: boot floppy images from
.Pa \*M/installation/floppy/ .
.Pp
.Pa boot1.fs
and
.Pa boot2.fs
are floppy images for VGA console installation.
.Pa boot-com1.fs
and
.Pa boot-com2.fs
are for installation via serial console (com0, 9600 baud).
.It
The default kernel on CD-ROMs has ACPI enabled.
This is known to cause issues on a few machines which have buggy ACPI
implementations.
.Pp
To boot with ACPI disabled, choose the "no ACPI" option from the boot menu,
or interrupt the menu and enter the
.Nx
boot prompt.
Type 
.Ic boot -2
to boot with ACPI disabled.
.\} \" amd64:i386
.if \n[macppc] \{\
The files depend on which model you
are using and how you plan to boot your machine.
For systems with built-in floppy drives (Open Firmware 1 or 2), 
fetch the pair of boot floppy images
.Pa macppc/installation/floppy/boot1.fs
and
.Pa macppc/installation/floppy/boot2.fs ,
which include the bootloader and installation kernel.
For systems without floppy drives (most are Open Firmware 3), fetch the
bootloader
.Pa macppc/installation/ofwboot.xcf
and the installation kernel
.Pa macppc/binary/kernel/netbsd-GENERIC_MD.gz .
If you have a CD-R, you can fetch the CD image,
.Pa NetBSD-\*V-macppc.iso .
.\}
.if \n[sparc] \{\
Fetch a CD image,
.Pa NetBSD-\*V-sparc.iso
or the floppy disk images,
.Pa sparc/install/floppy/disk1.gz No and Pa sparc/install/floppy/disk2 .
You need either the pair of floppies or the CD to boot your system.
.\}
.if \n[sparc64] \{\
This is either a CD image,
.Pa NetBSD-\*V-sparc64.iso
or the installation kernel and bootloader,
.Pa sparc64/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.gz No and Pa sparc64/installation/misc/ofwboot
which can be booted from a
.Tn Solaris
or
.Nx
partition.
.\}
.if \n[macppc]:\n[sparc]:\n[sparc64] \{\
Alternatively, you may netboot the installation kernel.  This process is
covered below, in detail.
.\}
.It
The actual binary distribution is in the
.Pa \*M/binary/sets/
directory.
When you boot the install
.if \n[amd64] image, CD-ROM or floppies,
.if \n[i386] image, CD-ROM or floppies,
.if \n[macppc] kernel from floppies, hard drive, or CD-ROM,
.if \n[sparc] floppies or CD-ROM,
.if \n[sparc64] CD-ROM or installation kernel,
the installation program
can fetch these files for you (using e.g. ftp)
if you have a network connection.
There are several other methods to get the binary sets onto
your machine.
.Pp
You will at a minimum need
.ie \n[i386]:\n[amd64] \{\
one of the kernel sets, typically
.Pa kern-GENERIC.tgz ,
as well as
.\}
.el \{\
the following sets:
.Pa kern-GENERIC.tgz , 
.\}
.Pa base.tgz
and
.Pa etc.tgz .
In a typical workstation installation you will probably want
all the installation sets.
.ie \n[i386]:\n[amd64] \{\
.It
Write the CD-ROM images or floppy images out.
.Pp
Many commercial and freeware programs are available to burn CD-ROMs.
.Pp
If you have problems writing a raw image to a floppy,
the
.Ic rawrite.exe
MS-DOS program
or the
.Ic Rawrite32
Windows32 program (installed by
.Pa rawr32.exe )
in the
.Pa i386/installation/misc/
directory may be of help.
.\}
.if \n[macppc] \{\
.It
If your \*M has a floppy drive, create the pair of boot floppies using 
.Ic suntar
(MacOS 9),
.Ic rawrite
(Windows), or
.Ic dd
(any
.Ul
system with floppy support).  If your system has Open Firmware 3, drag
.Pa ofwboot.xcf No and Pa netbsd-GENERIC_MD.gz
to your hard drive icon (the top level of the drive, not the desktop).
If you are using the CD image, burn it now.
.\}
.if \n[sparc] \{\
.It
Make sure your sparc's CD-ROM drive is bootable.
Burn the CD.
Otherwise, write the floppy images directly to a pair of floppies
(after uncompressing disk1.gz).
.\}

.It
Burn the CD or put the installation kernel and bootloader 
at the root level of a bootable

The disk(s) you just prepared will be used to boot the installation
kernel, which contains all the tools required to install
.Nx .
.if \n[macppc] \{\

Determine your machine's model, quirks, and Open Firmware version from the
.Nx*M
Model Support webpage.

.Pp
At present,
.Nx*M
cannot exist on the same hard drive as
.Tn Mac OS
unless you partition your disk before running the installer.
Open Firmware versions prior to 3 require a dedicated
.Nx
drive \(em you must use the entire disk,
partitioned with the installation tools.
Open Firmware version 3 cannot boot into
.Nx
on a drive partitioned with the installation tools, you must partition
your disk before running the installer, then select the
.Dq Me "Re-install sets or install additional sets"
option in the installer (selecting the
.Dq Me "Install NetBSD to hard disk"
or
.Dq Me "Upgrade NetBSD on a hard disk"
options will render your drive unbootable).
If you are unsure, you may want to read the section below on
.Sx Partitioning your hard drive for NetBSD
.It
For systems with Open Firmware versions prior to 3, you may need to use
Apple's System Disk utility to enter Open Firmware and use your screen and
keyboard.
To enter Open Firmware, hold down the
.Key COMMAND-OPTION-O-F
keys after the boot chime starts, but before the chime ends.
Entering Open Firmware versions prior to 3 is usually the most frustrating
part of installation \(em you may want to read the section below on
.Sx Older Open Firmware System Preparation
.Pp
You should have the Open Firmware
.Dq Pa "0 \*[Gt]"
prompt on your screen before attempting to boot
.Nx*M .
.\}
.if \n[macppc] \{\
.It
At the Open Firmware prompt, type the command to boot.
To boot from the installation floppies, the command is
.Dq Ic "boot fd:0" .
For the install kernel and bootloader on your hard drive (Open Firmware
3), the command is
.Dq Ic "boot hd:,\eofwboot.xcf netbsd-GENERIC_MD.gz" .
.Pp
For boot CDs, the command is something like
.Dq Ic "boot cd:,\eofwboot.xcf netbsd.macppc"
(for Open Firmware 3) or
.Dq Ic "boot scsi-int/sd@3:0 NETBSD.MACPPC"
(for earlier Open Firmware versions).
You will need to use the correct case for
.Ic OFWBOOT.XCF No and Ic NETBSD.MACPPC
depending on how your version of Open Firmware interprets the ISO
file system.
You may need to replace
.Ic cd
with
.Ic "scsi/sd@3 , scsi-int/sd@3 , ata/atapi-disk ,"
or some other device alias.
You should also use the Open Firmware
.Ic dir
command to confirm that the
.Nx*M
kernel is called
.Pa NETBSD.MACPPC .
You may want to read the section below on
.Sx Open Firmware boot syntax

After your system first powers on and displays some initial information,
press the

keys, or send a BREAK if you're on a serial console.
At the
.Dq Ic "ok"
prompt, type the command to boot your system into

The command to boot from CD is one of the following commands (depending on
your model):
.Dq Ic b sd(,30,) ,
.Dq Ic boot sd(,30,) ,
or
.Dq Ic boot cdrom .
.Pp
The command to boot from floppy is either
.Dq Ic boot fd(,,1)
or
.Dq Ic boot floppy .
The installer will prompt you to insert the second floppy when it is ready
for it.

.if \n[sparc64] \{\
The command to boot from CD is:
.Dq Ic boot cdrom .
The command to boot the
.Nx
kernel from a 
.Tn Solaris
or
.Nx
partition depends on which disk and partition it is on.
To boot from the first partition of the first (primary) disk:
.Dq Ic "boot disk:a /ofwboot -a" .
When it asks you for a kernel, specify
.Dq Ic "netbsd-INSTALL.gz"

.Ss "What is NetBSD?"
.Pp
.
The
.Nx
Operating System is a fully functional
.Tn Open Source
.Ul
operating system derived from the University of California, Berkeley
Networking Release 2 (Net/2), 4.4BSD-Lite, and 4.4BSD-Lite2 sources.
.Nx
runs on 57 different system architectures (ports)
across 15 distinct CPU families, and is being ported to more.
The
.Nx
\*V release contains complete binary releases for many different
system architectures.
(A few ports are not fully supported at this time 
and are thus not part of the binary distribution.
Please see the
.Nx
web site at
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/
for information on them.)
.Pp
.Nx
is a completely integrated system.
In addition to its highly portable, high performance kernel,
.nh
.Nx
features a complete set of user utilities, compilers for several
languages, the X Window System, firewall software
and numerous other tools, all accompanied by full source code.
.Pp
.\" XXX Should we include some text here about NetBSD's license
.\" policies and how commercial-friendly it is?
.Nx
is a creation of the members of the Internet community.
Without the unique cooperation and coordination the net makes
possible, it's likely that
.Nx
wouldn't exist.

.Ss Changes Between The NetBSD 5.0 and 6.0 Releases
.Pp
The
.Nx
\*V release
provides numerous significant functional enhancements, including
support for many new devices, integration of hundreds of bug fixes,
new and updated kernel subsystems, and many user-land enhancements.
The result of these improvements is a stable operating system fit for
production use that rivals most commercially available systems.
.Pp
It is impossible to completely summarize the massive development that
went into the
.Nx
\*V release.
The complete list of changes can be found in the
CHANGES:
.Lk http://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-6.0/CHANGES

.Pp
In addition to the files and directories listed above, there is one
directory per architecture, for each of the architectures for which
.Nx
\*V has a binary distribution.
.Pp
The source distribution sets can be found in subdirectories of the
.Pa source
subdirectory of the distribution tree.
They contain the complete sources to the system.
The source distribution sets are as follows:
.(tag sharesrc
.It Sy gnusrc
This set contains the
.Dq gnu
sources, including the source for the compiler, assembler, groff,
and the other GNU utilities in the binary distribution sets.
.It Sy sharesrc
This set contains the
.Dq share
sources, which include the sources for the man pages not associated
with any particular program; the sources for the typesettable document
set; the dictionaries; and more.
.It Sy src
This set contains all of the base
.Nx
\*V sources which are not in
.Sy gnusrc ,
.Sy sharesrc ,
or
.Sy syssrc .
.It Sy syssrc
This set contains the sources to the
.Nx
\*V kernel for all architectures as well as the
.Xr config 1
utility.
.It Sy xsrc
This set contains the sources to the X Window System.
.tag)
.Pp
All the above source sets are located in the
.Pa source/sets
subdirectory of the distribution tree.
.Pp
The source sets are distributed as compressed tar files.
Except for the
.Sy pkgsrc 
set, which is traditionally unpacked into
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc ,
all sets may be unpacked into
.Pa /usr/src
with the command:
.Dl # Ic "cd / ; tar -zxpf set_name.tgz"
.Pp
In each of the source distribution set directories, there are
files which contain the checksums of the files in the directory:
.(tag SHA512 -offset indent

.Tn SHA512
digests in the format produced by the command:
.br

.Ss "Compatibility Issues With Previous NetBSD Releases"
.Pp
.
Users upgrading from previous versions of
.Nx
may wish to bear the
following problems and compatibility issues in mind when upgrading to
.Nx
\*V.
.Pp
Note that
.Ic sysinst
will automatically invoke
.(disp
postinstall fix
.disp)
and thus all issues that are fixed by
.Ic postinstall
by default (see below) will be handled.
.
.Ss2 Issues affecting an upgrade from NetBSD 5.x releases
.Pp
The pthread libraries from previous versions of
.Nx
require that the
.Xr sysctl 3
node
.Dv kern.no_sa_support
be set to
.Dv 0 .
This affects the following environments:
.(bullet
Running a 5.0 kernel with an older userland.
.It
Running an older userland inside a chroot'ed environment on a 5.0 system.
.It
Running older statically linked pthread applications.
.bullet)
.Pp
The 5.0 kernel defaults to
.Dv 0
for 
.Dv kern.no_sa_support ,
which covers the first case.
However, please note that a full installation of 5.0
.Pq either from scratch or through an upgrade
will set
.Dv kern.no_sa_support
to 1 during the boot process.
This means that for the last two cases, you will have to manually set
.Dv kern.no_sa_support
to
.Dv 0 ,
using either the
.Xr sysctl 8
command or through
.Xr sysctl.conf 5 .
.Pp
The implementation of SHA2-HMAC in KAME_IPSEC as used in NetBSD-5
and before did not comply to current standards.
FAST_IPSEC does, with the result that old and new systems cannot
communicate over IPSEC, if one of the affected authentication
algorithms (hmac_sha256, hmac_sha384, hmac_sha512) is used.
.
.Ss2 Issues affecting an upgrade from NetBSD 4.x releases
.Pp
The following issues can generally be resolved by running
.Em postinstall
with the
.Sy etc
set:
.(disp
postinstall -s /path/to/etc.tgz check
postinstall -s /path/to/etc.tgz fix
.disp)
.Pp
Issues fixed by
.Em postinstall :

.
.(bullet -offset indent
The users
.Sq _httpd
and
.Sq _timedc
and the groups
.Sq _httpd
and
.Sq _timedc
need to be created.
.It
Unprivileged use of the
.Xr mount 8
command now requires the
.Ar nosuid
and
.Ar nodev
options to be explicitly specified.
Previously, these options were automatically enforced even if they
were not explicitly specified.
.It
A number of things have been removed from the
.Nx
\*V release.
See the "Components removed from NetBSD" section near the beginning of
this document for a list.
.bullet)
.
.Ss "Using online NetBSD documentation"
.Pp
Documentation is available if you installed the manual
distribution set.
Traditionally, the
.Dq man pages
(documentation) are denoted by
.Sq Li name(section) .
Some examples of this are
.Pp
.(bullet -compact -offset indent
.Xr intro 1 ,
.It
.Xr man 1 ,
.It
.Xr apropos 1 ,
.It
.Xr passwd 1 ,
and
.It
.Xr passwd 5 .
.bullet)
.Pp
The section numbers group the topics into several categories, but three
are of primary interest: user commands are in section 1, file formats
are in section 5, and administrative information is in section 8.
.Pp
.No The Em man
command is used to view the documentation on a topic, and is
started by entering
.Ic man
.Op Ar section
.Ar topic .
The brackets
.Op \&
around the
section should not be entered, but rather indicate that the section is
optional.
If you don't ask for a particular section, the topic with the
lowest numbered section name will be displayed.
For instance, after logging in, enter
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "man passwd"
.Pp
to read the documentation for
.Xr passwd 1 .
To view the documentation for
.Xr passwd 5 ,
enter
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "man 5 passwd"
.Pp
instead.
.Pp
If you are unsure of what man page you are looking for, enter
.Pp
.Dl # Ic apropos Ar subject-word
.Pp
where
.Ar subject-word
is your topic of interest; a list of possibly
related man pages will be displayed.

We'd like your input.
There are various mailing lists available via the mailing list
server at
.Mt majordomo@NetBSD.org .
To get help on using the mailing
list server, send mail to that address with an empty body, and it will
reply with instructions.  See
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/mailinglists/
for a web interface.
.Pp
There are various mailing lists set up to deal with comments and
questions about this release.
Please send comments to:
.Mt netbsd-comments@NetBSD.org .
.Pp
To report bugs, use the
.Xr send-pr 1
command shipped with
.Nx ,
and fill in as much information about the problem as you can.
Good bug reports include lots of details.
.Pp
Bugs also can be submitted and queried with the web interface at
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/support/send-pr.html
.Pp
There are also port-specific mailing lists, to discuss aspects of
each port of
.Nx .
Use majordomo to find their addresses, or visit
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/mailinglists/
.Pp
If
you're interested in doing a serious amount of work on a specific
port, you probably should contact the
.Sq owner
of that port (listed
below).
.Pp
If you'd like to help with this effort, and have an idea as to how
you could be useful, send us mail or subscribe to:
.Mt netbsd-users@NetBSD.org .
.Pp
As a favor, please avoid mailing huge documents or files to these
mailing lists.
Instead, put the material you would have sent up for FTP or WWW somewhere,
then mail the appropriate list about it, or, if you'd rather not do that,
mail the list saying you'll send the data to those who want it.
.
.Ss Thanks go to

We probably were not able to get in touch with you, to verify that you
wanted to be listed.)
.It
Finally, we thank all of the people who've put sweat and tears into
developing
.Nx
since its inception in January, 1993.
(Obviously, there are a lot more people who deserve thanks here.
If you're one of them, and would like to be mentioned, tell us!)
