.Ss "Quick install notes for the impatient"
.Pp
This section contains some brief notes describing what you need to
install
.Nx \*V
on a machine of the \*M architecture.
.Bl -bullet
.It
Fetch the
.if \n[i386]:\n[amd64] \{\
appropriate pair of boot floppy images from the
.Pa \*M/installation/floppy/
directory, or a CD-ROM image.
Most people will need the
.Pa boot1.fs
and
.Pa boot2.fs
images for VGA console installation, or the
.Pa boot-com1.fs
and
.Pa boot-com2.fs
images for installation via serial console.
.if \n[i386] \{\
You may also possibly (but not necessarily) want to use
.Pa bootlap1.fs
and
.Pa bootlap2.fs
if installing on a laptop.
.\}
.\}
.if \n[macppc] \{\
files necessary to boot your system.
The files depend on what model you
are using and how you plan to boot your machine.
For systems with built-in floppy drives (Open Firmware 1 or 2), 
fetch the pair of boot floppy images
.Pa macppc/installation/floppy/boot1.fs
and
.Pa macppc/installation/floppy/boot2.fs ,
which include the bootloader and installation kernel.
For systems without floppy drives (most are Open Firmware 3), fetch the
bootloader
.Pa macppc/installation/ofwboot.xcf
and the installation kernel
.Pa macppc/binary/kernel/netbsd-GENERIC_MD.gz .
If you have a CD-R, you can fetch the CD image,
.Pa macppccd-\*V.iso .
.\}
.if \n[sparc] \{\
CD image,
.Pa sparccd-\*V.iso
or the floppy disk images,
.Pa sparc/install/floppy/disk1.gz No and Pa sparc/install/floppy/disk2 .
You need either the pair of floppies or the CD to boot your system.
.\}
.if \n[sparc64] \{\
CD image,
.Pa sparc64cd-\*V.iso
or the installation kernel and bootloader,
.Pa sparc64/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.gz No and Pa sparc64/installation/misc/ofwboot
which can be booted from a
.Tn Solaris
or
.Nx
partition.
.\}
.if \n[macppc]:\n[sparc]:\n[sparc64] \{\
Alternatively, you may netboot the installation kernel.  This process is
covered below, in detail.
.\}
.It
The actual binary distribution is in the
.Pa \*M/binary/sets/
directory.
When you boot the install
.if \n[i386] floppies,
.if \n[macppc] kernel from floppies, hard drive, or CD-ROM,
.if \n[sparc] floppies or CD-ROM,
.if \n[sparc64] CD-ROM or installation kernel,
the installation program
can fetch these files for you (using e.g. ftp),
if you have a network connection.
There are several other methods to get the binary sets onto
your machine.
.Pp
You will at a minimum need
.ie \n[i386]:\n[amd64] \{\
one of the kernel sets, typically
.Pa kern-GENERIC.tgz ,
as well as
.\}
.el \{\
the following sets:
.Pa kern-GENERIC.tgz , 
.\}
.Pa base.tgz
and
.Pa etc.tgz .
In a typical workstation installation you will probably want
all the installation sets.
.if \n[i386] \{\
.It
Write the floppy images directly to a pair of floppies.
If you have problems writing a raw image to a floppy,
the
.Ic rawrite.exe
MS-DOS program
or the
.Ic Rawrite32.exe
Windows32 program (inside
.Pa rawrite32.zip )
in the
.Pa i386/installation/misc/
directory may be of help.
.\}
.if \n[macppc] \{\
.It
If your \*M has a floppy drive, create the pair of boot floppies using 
.Ic suntar
(MacOS 9),
.Ic rawrite
(Windows), or
.Ic dd
(any
.Ul
system with floppy support).  If your system has Open Firmware 3, drag
.Pa ofwboot.xcf No and Pa netbsd-GENERIC_MD.gz
to your hard drive icon (the top level of the drive, not the desktop).
If you are using the CD image, burn it now.
.\}
.if \n[sparc] \{\
.It
Make sure your sparc's CD-ROM drive is bootable.
Burn the CD.
Otherwise, write the floppy images directly to a pair of floppies
(after uncompressing disk1.gz).
.\}
.if \n[sparc64] \{\
.It
Burn the CD or put the installation kernel and bootloader 
at the root level of a bootable
.Tn Solaris
or
.Nx
partition.
.\}
.Pp
The disk(s) you just prepared will be used to boot the installation
kernel, which contains all the tools required to install
.Nx .
.if \n[macppc] \{\
.It
Determine your machine's model, quirks, and Open Firmware version from the
.Nx*M
Model Support webpage.
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/Ports/macppc/models.html
.Pp
At present,
.Nx*M
cannot exist on the same hard drive as
.Tn Mac OS
unless you partition your disk before running the installer.
Open Firmware versions prior to 3 require a dedicated
.Nx
drive \(em you must use the entire disk,
partitioned with the installation tools.
Open Firmware version 3 cannot boot into
.Nx
on a drive partitioned with the installation tools, you must partition
your disk before running the installer, then select the
.Dq Me "Re-install sets or install additional sets"
option in the installer (selecting the
.Dq Me "Install NetBSD to hard disk"
or
.Dq Me "Upgrade NetBSD on a hard disk"
options will render your drive unbootable).
If you are unsure, you may want to read the section below on
.Sx Partitioning your hard drive for NetBSD
.It
For systems with Open Firmware versions prior to 3, you may need to use
Apple's System Disk utility to enter Open Firmware and use your screen and
keyboard.
To enter Open Firmware, hold down the
.Key COMMAND-OPTION-O-F
keys after the boot chime starts, but before the chime ends.
Entering Open Firmware versions prior to 3 is usually the most frustrating
part of installation \(em you may want to read the section below on
.Sx Older Open Firmware System Preparation
.Pp
You should have the Open Firmware
.Dq Pa "0 \*>"
prompt on your screen before attempting to boot
.Nx*M .
.\}
.if \n[macppc] \{\
.It
At the Open Firmware prompt, type the command to boot.
To boot from the installation floppies, the command is
.Dq Ic "boot fd:0" .
For the install kernel and bootloader on your hard drive (Open Firmware
3), the command is
.Dq Ic "boot hd:,\eofwboot.xcf netbsd-GENERIC_MD.gz" .
.Pp
For boot CDs, the command is something like
.Dq Ic "boot cd:,\eofwboot.xcf netbsd.macppc"
(for Open Firmware 3) or
.Dq Ic "boot scsi-int/sd@3:0 NETBSD.MACPPC"
(for earlier Open Firmware versions).
You will need to use the correct case for
.Ic OFWBOOT.XCF No and Ic NETBSD.MACPPC
depending on how your version of Open Firmware interprets the ISO
file system.
You may need to replace
.Ic cd
with
.Ic "scsi/sd@3 , scsi-int/sd@3 , ata/atapi-disk ,"
or some other device alias.
You should also use the Open Firmware
.Ic dir
command to confirm that the
.Nx*M
kernel is called
.Pa NETBSD.MACPPC .
You may want to read the section below on
.Sx Open Firmware boot syntax

After your system first powers on, and displays some initial information,
press the

.Dq Ic boot cdrom .
.Pp
The command to boot from floppy is either
.Dq Ic boot fd(,,1)

.Dq Ic boot floppy .
The installer will prompt you to insert the second floppy when it is ready
for it.

.if \n[sparc64] \{\
The command to boot from CD is:

.Dq Ic "boot disk:a /ofwboot -a" .
When it asks you for a kernel, specify
.Dq Ic "netbsd-INSTALL.gz"

.Ss "What is NetBSD?"
.Pp
.
The
.Nx
Operating System is a fully functional
.Tn Open Source
.Ul
operating system derived from the University of California, Berkeley
Networking Release 2 (Net/2), 4.4BSD-Lite, and 4.4BSD-Lite2 sources.
.Nx
runs on fifty four different system architectures (ports),
featuring seventeen machine architectures
across fifteen distinct CPU families,
and is being ported to more.
The
.Nx \*V
release contains complete binary releases for many different
system architectures.
(A few ports are not fully supported at this time 
and are thus not part of the binary distribution.
For information on them, please see the
.Nx
web site at
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/ . )
.Pp
.Nx
is a completely integrated system.
In addition to its highly portable, high performance kernel,
.nh
.Nx
features a complete set of user utilities, compilers for several
languages, the X Window System, firewall software
and numerous other tools, all accompanied by full source code.
.Pp
.\" XXX Should we include some text here about NetBSD's license
.\" policies and how commercial-friendly it is?
.Nx
is a creation of the members of the Internet community.
Without the unique cooperation and coordination the net makes
possible, it's likely that
.Nx
wouldn't exist.

.Ss Changes Between The NetBSD 2.0 and 3.0 Releases
.Pp
The
.Nx 3.0
release
provides numerous significant functional enhancements, including
support for many new devices, integration of hundreds of bug fixes,
new and updated kernel subsystems, and many user-land enhancements.
The result of these improvements is a stable operating system fit for
production use that rivals most commercially available systems.

.Ss "The Future of NetBSD"
.Pp
.
The
.Nx
Foundation has been incorporated as a non-profit
organization.
Its purpose is to encourage, foster and promote the free exchange
of computer software, namely the
.Nx
Operating
System.
The foundation will allow for many things to be handled more
smoothly than could be done with our previous informal organization.
In particular, it provides the framework to deal with other parties
that wish to become involved in the
.Nx
Project.
.Pp
The
.Nx
Foundation will help improve the quality of
.Nx
by:
.(bullet
providing better organization to keep track of development
efforts, including co-ordination with groups working in
related fields.
.It
providing a framework to receive donations of goods and
services and to own the resources necessary to run the
.Nx
Project.
.It
providing a better position from which to undertake
promotional activities.
.It
periodically organizing workshops for developers and other
interested people to discuss ongoing work.
.bullet)
.Pp
We intend to begin narrowing the time delay between releases.
Our ambition is to provide a full release every six to eight months.
.Pp
We hope to support even
.Em more
hardware in the future, and we have a
rather large number of other ideas about what can be done to improve
.Nx .
.Pp
We intend to continue our current practice of making the
NetBSD-current development source available on a daily basis.
.Pp
We intend to integrate free, positive changes from whatever sources
submit them, providing that they are well thought-out and increase the
usability of the system.
.Pp
Above all, we hope to create a stable and accessible system, and to be
responsive to the needs and desires of
.Nx
users, because it is for
and because of them that
.Nx
exists.

If you've got something to say, do so!
We'd like your input.
There are various mailing lists available via the mailing list
server at
.Mt majordomo@NetBSD.org .
To get help on using the mailing
list server, send mail to that address with an empty body, and it will
reply with instructions.
.Pp
There are various mailing lists set up to deal with comments and
questions about this release.
Please send comments to:
.Mt netbsd-comments@NetBSD.org .
.Pp
To report bugs, use the
.Xr send-pr 1
command shipped with
.Nx ,
and fill in as much information about the problem as you can.
Good bug reports include lots of details.
Additionally, bug reports can be sent by mail to:
.Mt netbsd-bugs@NetBSD.org .
.Pp
Use of
.Xr send-pr 1
is encouraged, however, because bugs reported with it
are entered into the
.Nx
bugs database, and thus can't slip through
the cracks.
.Pp
There are also port-specific mailing lists, to discuss aspects of
each port of
.Nx .
Use majordomo to find their addresses, or visit
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/MailingLists/ .
If
you're interested in doing a serious amount of work on a specific
port, you probably should contact the
.Sq owner
of that port (listed
below).
.Pp
If you'd like to help with this effort, and have an idea as to how
you could be useful, send us mail or subscribe to:
.Mt netbsd-help@NetBSD.org .
.Pp
As a favor, please avoid mailing huge documents or files to these
mailing lists.
Instead, put the material you would have sent up for FTP or WWW somewhere,
then mail the appropriate list about it, or, if you'd rather not do that,
mail the list saying you'll send the data to those who want it.

for their ongoing work on
.Bx
systems, support, and encouragement.
.It
The Internet Systems Consortium, Inc. for hosting the
.Nx
FTP, CVS, AnonCVS, mail, mail archive, GNATS, SUP, Rsync and WWW servers.
.It
The Internet Research Institute in Japan for hosting the server
which runs the CVSweb interface to the
.Nx
source tree.
.It
The Helsinki University of Technology in Finland for hosting the
.Nx
backup CVS and backup server.
.It
SSH Communications Security in Finland for operating
the backup server. 
.It
The many organisations that provide
.Nx
mirror sites.
.It
Without CVS, this project would be impossible to manage, so our hats
go off to Brian Berliner, Jeff Polk, and the various other people
who've had a hand in making CVS a useful tool.
.It
The following individuals and organizations (each in alphabetical order)
have made donations or loans of hardware and/or money, to support
.Nx
development, and deserve credit for it:
.so ../common/donations -----------------------------------------------
(If you're not on that list and should be, tell us!
We probably were not able to get in touch with you, to verify that you
wanted to be listed.)
.It
Finally, we thank all of the people who've put sweat and tears into
developing
.Nx
since its inception in January, 1993.
(Obviously, there are a lot more people who deserve thanks here.
If you're one of them, and would like to mentioned, tell us!)
