.Ss "What is NetBSD?"
.
The
.Nx
Operating System is a fully functional
.Tn Open Source
UN*X-like operating system derived from the University of California, Berkeley
Networking Release 2 (Net/2), 4.4BSD-Lite, and 4.4BSD-Lite2 sources.
.Nx
runs on thirty-one different system architectures featuring twelve distinct
families of CPUs, and is being ported to more. The
.Nx \*V
release contains complete binary releases for fifteen different
machine types. (The sixteen remaining are not fully supported at this time
and are thus not part of the binary distribution. For information on
them, please see the
.Nx
web site at
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/ )
.Pp
.Nx
is a completely integrated system.
In addition to its highly portable, high performance kernel,
.Nx
features a complete set of user utilities, compilers for several
languages, The X Window System,
and numerous other tools, all accompanied by full source code.
.Pp
.\" XXX Should we include some text here about NetBSD's license
.\" policies and how commercial-friendly it is?
.Nx
is a creation of the members of the Internet community.
Without the unique cooperation and coordination the net makes
possible, it's likely that
.Nx
wouldn't exist.
.Ss Changes Since The Last Release
.if \n[FOR_RELEASE] \{\
The
.Nx \*V
release is a substantial improvement over its predecessors.  We have
provided numerous significant functional enhancements, including
support for many new devices, integration of hundreds of bug fixes,
new and updated kernel subsystems, and many userland enhancements. The
results of these improvements is a stable operating system fit for
production use that rivals most commercially available systems.
.Pp
It is impossible to completely summarize over one year of
development that went into the
.Nx \*V
release. Some highlights include:
.(bullet
.
.\" Kernel
.
Ports to new platforms including:
arc,
arm26,
cobolt,
evbsh3,
hpcmips,

audio, UDMA/66 support for ATA drives, USB, and wireless networking.
.
.\" Networking
.
.It
Addition of IP version 6 and IPsec to the networking stack, from the
KAME project.
This includes addition of kernel code for IPv6/IPsec,
IPv4/v6 dual-stack user applications and supporting libraries.
Due to this, shlib major version for
.Xr pcap 3
is incremented and you may need a recompilation of your userland tools.
The KAME IPv6 part includes result from unified-ipv6 effort.
.
.\" Filesystem
.
.It
Significant Fast file system (FFS) performance enhancements via
integration of Kirk McKusick's soft updates and trickle sync code.
.It
Read-only support for the NTFS (Windows NT) file system.
.It
Support for the extfs revision 1 (Linux) file system.
.It
Enhanced stability and usability of LFS (the BSD log-structured file system).

and auto-configuration of RAID sets, and the ability to configure the root
filesystem on a RAID set.
.It
Support for the Microsoft Joliet extensions to the ISO9660 CD file system.
.It
The filesystem vnode locking mechanisms have been improved,
thus resolving a source of many panics in the past.
.
.\"XXX.It
.\"XXXSupport for booting off RAIDframe and LFS partitions (port specific).
.It
NFS (and RPC) are supported over IPv6.
.It
The NFS locking protocol (implemented with
.Xr rpc.lockd 8 )
now works.
.
.\" Security
.
.It
Strong cryptographic libraries and applications integrated,
including the AES cipher Rijndael, the OpenSSL library, more
complete Kerberos IV and Kerberos V support, and an SSH client.
.It
Provide
.Xr sysctl 3
interfaces to various elements of process and system information,
allowing programs such as
.Xr ps 1 ,
.Xr dmesg 1
and the like to operate without recompilation after kernel upgrades,
and remove the necessity to run setgid kmem (thus improving system
security).
.It
Disable various services by default, and set the default options for
disable daemons to a higher level of logging.
.
.\" System administration / userland
.
.It
Convert the
.Xr rc 8
system startup and shutdown scripts to an
.Sq rc.d
mechanism, with separate control scripts for each service.
.It
Provide
.Xr postfix 1
as an alternate mail transport agent to
.Xr sendmail 8 .
.It
Addition of user management tools
.Xr useradd 8 ,
.Xr usermod 8 ,

.It
Many enhancements to
.Xr ftpd 8
providing features found in larger and less secure FTP daemons,
such as user classes, connection limits, improved support for
virtual hosting, transfer statistics, transfer rate throttling,
and support for various IETF ftpext working group extensions.
.It
Everyone's favorite
.Xr ftp 1
client has been improved even further, including
transfer rate throttling, improved URL support, command line uploads.
See the man page for details.
.
.\" Misc
.
.It
Update the
.Nx
source code style code (located in
.Pa /usr/share/misc/style )
to use ANSI C only (instead of K&R) and reflect current (best) practice,
and begin migrating the
.Nx
source code to follow it.
.It
Implementation of many SUSv2 features to the
.Xr curses 3
library, including support for color.
.It
Several new ports, including macppc, bebox, sparc64, next68k, and
others, have been integrated into the source tree.
.It
Most third party packages that are shipped in the base system, including
.Xr file 1 ,
.Xr ipfilter 4 ,
.Xr ppp 4 ,
and
.Xr sendmail 8
have been updated to the latest stable release.
.It
Many new packages in the
.Em pkgsrc
system, including standard desktops like KDE and GNOME as well as latest
Tcl/Tk and perl and many of the components of the Java Enterprise platform.
The package framework itself now has full wildcard dependency support.
.bullet)
.Pp
As has been noted, there have also been innumerable bug fixes.
.Pp
Kernel interfaces have continued to be refined, and more subsystems
and device drivers are shared among the different ports. You can look
for this trend to continue.

.Ss "The Future of NetBSD"
.
The
.Nx
Foundation has been incorporated as a non-profit
organization. Its purpose is to encourage, foster and promote the
free exchange of computer software, namely the
.Nx
Operating
System. The foundation will allow for many things to be handled more
smoothly than could be done with our previous informal organization.
In particular, it provides the framework to deal with other parties
that wish to become involved in the
.Nx
Project.
.Pp
The
.Nx
Foundation will help improve the quality of
.Nx
by:
.(bullet
providing better organization to keep track of development
efforts, including co-ordination with groups working in
related fields.
.It
providing a framework to receive donations of goods and
services and to own the resources necessary to run the
.Nx
Project.
.It
providing a better position from which to undertake
promotional activities.
.It
periodically organizing workshops for developers and other
interested people to discuss ongoing work.
.bullet)
.Pp
We intend to begin narrowing the time delay between releases. Our
ambition is to provide a full release every six to eight months.
.Pp
We hope to support even
.Em more
hardware in the future, and we have a
rather large number of other ideas about what can be done to improve
.Nx .
.Pp
We intend to continue our current practice of making the
NetBSD-current development source available on a daily basis.
.Pp
We intend to integrate free, positive changes from whatever sources
submit them, providing that they are well thought-out and increase the
usability of the system.
.Pp
Above all, we hope to create a stable and accessible system, and to be
responsive to the needs and desires of
.Nx
users, because it is for
and because of them that
.Nx
exists.

has a binary distribution. There are also
\&'README.export-control' files sprinkled liberally throughout the
distribution tree, which point out that there are some portions of the
distribution (i.e. the `domestic' portion) that may be subject to
export regulations of the United States.  It is your responsibility
to determine whether or not it is legal for you to export these portions
and to act accordingly.

The source distribution sets can be found in subdirectories of the
"source" subdirectory of the distribution tree. They contain the
complete sources to the system. The source distribution sets
are as follows:
.(tag sharesrc

.Pp
.No The Pa sets/Split/
subdirectory contains split
versions of the source sets for those users who need to load the
source sets from floppy or otherwise need a split distribution. The
split sets are are named "set_name.xx" where "set_name" is the
distribution set name, and "xx" is the sequence number of the file,
starting with "aa" for the first file in the distribution set, then
"ab" for the next, and so on. All of these files except the last one
of each set should be exactly 240,640 bytes long. (The last file is
just long enough to contain the remainder of the data for that
distribution set.)
.Pp
The split distributions may be reassembled and extracted with
.Ic cat No as follows:
.D1 Ic "cat set_name.?? | tar -C / -xzpf -"

.Pp
.(bullet
.Xr named 8
leaks version information
.
.Pp
Previous releases of
.Nx
disabled a feature of
.Xr named 8
where the version number of the server could be determined by remote clients.
This feature has not been disabled in
.Nx 1.5 ,
because there is a
.Xr named.conf 5
option to change the version string:
.(disp
option {
	version "newstring";
};
.disp)
.
.It
.Xr sysctl 8
pathname changed
.
.Pp
.Xr sysctl 8
is moved from

to
.Pa /sbin/sysctl .
If you have hardcoded reference to full pathname
.Pq in shell scripts, for example
please be sure to update those.
.\"
.It
.Xr sendmail 8
configuration file pathname changed
.
.Pp
Due to
.Xr sendmail 8
upgrade from 8.9.x to 8.10.x,
.Pa /etc/sendmail.cf
is moved to
.Pa /etc/mail/sendmail.cf .
Also, the default
.Xr sendmail.cf 5
refers different pathnames than before.
For example,
.Pa /etc/aliases
is now located at
.Pa /etc/mail/aliases ,
.Pa /etc/sendmail.cw
is now called
.Pa /etc/mail/local-host-names ,
and so forth.
If you have customized

.Ss "Using online NetBSD documentation"
.Pp
Documentation is available if you first install the manual
distribution set. Traditionally, the

(documentation) are denoted by
.Dq Li name(section) .
Some examples of this are
.Pp
.(bullet -compact -offset indent

.Xr man 1 ,
.It
.Xr apropros 1 ,
.It
.Xr passwd 1 ,
and
.It
.Xr passwd 5 .
.bullet)
.Pp
The section numbers group the topics into several categories, but three
are of primary interest: user commands are in section 1, file formats
are in section 5, and administrative information is in section 8.
.Pp
.No The Em man
command is used to view the documentation on a topic, and is
started by entering
.Ic man Op Ar section
.Ar topic .
The brackets
.Op \&
around the
section should not be entered, but rather indicate that the section is
optional. If you don't ask for a particular section, the topic with the
lowest numbered section name will be displayed. For instance, after
logging in, enter
.D1 Ic "man passwd
to read the documentation for
.Xr passwd 1 .
To view the documentation for
.Xr passwd 5 m
enter
.D1 Ic man 5 passwd
instead.
.Pp
If you are unsure of what man page you are looking for, enter
.Ic apropos Ar subject-word
.Pp
where
.Ar subject-word
is your topic of interest; a list of possibly
related man pages will be displayed.
.
.Ss Administrivia
.
If you've got something to say, do so! We'd like your input.
There are various mailing lists available via the mailing list
server at
.Mt majordomo@netbsd.org .
To get help on using the mailing
list server, send mail to that address with an empty body, and it will
reply with instructions.
.Pp
There are various mailing lists set up to deal with comments and
questions about this release. Please send comments to:
.Mt netbsd-comments@netbsd.org .
.Pp
To report bugs, use the
.Xr send-pr 1
command shipped with
.Nx ,
and fill in as much information about the problem as you can. Good
bug reports include lots of details. Additionally, bug reports can
be sent by mail to:
.Mt netbsd-bugs@netbsd.org .
.Pp
Use of
.Xr send-pr 1
is encouraged, however, because bugs reported with it
are entered into the
.Nx
bugs database, and thus can't slip through
the cracks.
.Pp
There are also port-specific mailing lists, to discuss aspects of
each port of
.Nx .
Use majordomo to find their addresses. If
you're interested in doing a serious amount of work on a specific
port, you probably should contact the "owner" of that port (listed
below).
.Pp
If you'd like to help with this effort, and have an idea as to how
you could be useful, send us mail or subscribe to:
.Mt netbsd-help@netbsd.org .
.Pp
As a favor, please avoid mailing huge documents or files to these
mailing lists. Instead, put the material you would have sent up
for FTP somewhere, then mail the appropriate list about it, or, if
you'd rather not do that, mail the list saying you'll send the data
to those who want it.
