	To "regenerate" this file, go up one level to src/distrib/notes
	and type "make".  This will create
	src/distrib/notes/<arch>/INSTALL.*.

	We keep most of the notes the same on HEAD and release branches,
	but some of this are not appropriate for HEAD/current. Also
	some locations differ for actual release, so we distinguish
	between:

	RELEASE_BRANCH == 1
		this is on a release branch (not -current)
	RELEASE_BRANCH == 0
		this is current, not yet branched
	FOR_RELEASE == 1
		this is an official release (will be signed and placed
		on ftp/cdn)
	FOR_RELEASE == 0
		this is a local build or a "daily" build on the build
		cluster

Alternatively, you may netboot the installation kernel.  This process is

The actual binary distribution is in the

the installation program
can fetch these files for you (using, e.g., ftp)
if you have a network connection.
There are several other methods to get the binary sets onto
your machine.
.Pp
You will at a minimum need
.ie \n[i386]:\n[amd64] \{\
one of the kernel sets, typically
.Pa kern-GENERIC.\*[setsuffix] ,
as well as
.\}
.el \{\
the following sets:

Write the boot images
.Pp
Many commercial and freeware programs are available to burn CD-ROMs.
.Pp
If installing via USB, you must first uncompress the USB image, which
is gzipped.
.if \n[amd64] \{\
Note the \*M architecture has two images, NetBSD-\*V-\*M-install.img.gz

hardware which is unable to boot using a hybrid MBR and GPT image.
.\}
.Dl $ Ic "gunzip NetBSD-\*V-\*M-install.img.gz"
Next, write the USB image to a USB stick/drive.
Note that this will overwrite any existing data on the device that you
specify, so double check the device before running!
On
.Ul
operating systems, use a command similar to the following,
replacing
.Pa /dev/rsd0d
with the appropriate device for your system:
.Dl # Ic "dd if=NetBSD-\*V-\*M-install.img of=/dev/rsd0d bs=32k"
On Windows, you will need to use a program such as
.Lk http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/ "Win32 Disk Imager" ,
or
.Lk https://www.NetBSD.org/~martin/rawrite32 Rawrite32 .
If you have problems writing a raw image to a floppy,
the

MS-DOS program
in the

directory may be of help.

If your \*M has a floppy drive, create the pair of boot floppies using

At present,

Open Firmware versions prior to 3 require a dedicated

Open Firmware version 3 cannot boot into

on a drive partitioned with the installation tools, you must partition
your disk before running the installer, then select the
.Dq Me "Re-install sets or install additional sets"
option in the installer (selecting the
.Dq Me "Install NetBSD to hard disk"
or
.Dq Me "Upgrade NetBSD on a hard disk"
options will render your drive unbootable).
If you are unsure, you may want to read the section below on

For systems with Open Firmware versions prior to 3, you may need to use
Apple's System Disk utility to enter Open Firmware and use your screen and

keys after the boot chime starts, but before the chime ends.
Entering Open Firmware versions prior to 3 is usually the most frustrating
part of installation \(em you may want to read the section below on

At the Open Firmware prompt, type the command to boot.
To boot from the installation floppies, the command is

For the install kernel and bootloader on your hard drive (Open Firmware
3), the command is
.Dq Ic "boot hd:,\eofwboot.xcf netbsd-GENERIC_MD.gz" .

For boot CDs, the command is something like
.Dq Ic "boot cd:,\eofwboot.xcf netbsd.macppc"

(for earlier Open Firmware versions).
You will need to use the correct case for

You may need to replace
.Ic cd
with
.Ic "scsi/sd@3 , scsi-int/sd@3 , ata/atapi-disk ,"
or some other device alias.

.Pp
.
The
.Nx
Operating System is a fully functional open-source operating system derived
from the University of California, Berkeley Networking Release 2 (Net/2),
4.4BSD-Lite, and 4.4BSD-Lite2 sources.
.Nx
runs on many different different system architectures (ports)
across a variety of distinct CPU families, and is being ported to more.
The
.Nx
\*V release contains complete binary releases for most of these
system architectures, with preliminary support for the others included in
source form.
Please see the
.Nx
.Lk https://www.NetBSD.org/ website
for information on them.
.Pp
.Nx
is a completely integrated system.
In addition to its highly portable, high performance kernel,
.nh
.Nx
features a complete set of user utilities, compilers for several
languages, the X Window System, firewall software
and numerous other tools, all accompanied by full source code.
.Pp
.\" XXX Should we include some text here about NetBSD's license
.\" policies and how commercial-friendly it is?
.Nx
is a creation of the members of the Internet community.
Without the unique cooperation and coordination the net makes
possible,

The source distribution sets can be found in subdirectories of the

They contain the complete sources to the system.
The source distribution sets are as follows:
.(tag sharesrc
.It Sy gnusrc
This set contains the
.Dq gnu
sources, including the source for the compiler, assembler, groff,
and the other GNU utilities in the binary distribution sets.
.It Sy sharesrc

.It Sy xsrc
This set contains the sources to the X Window System.
.tag)
.Pp
All the above source sets are located in the
.Pa source/sets
subdirectory of the distribution tree.

The source sets are distributed as compressed tar files.
Except for the

all sets may be unpacked into
