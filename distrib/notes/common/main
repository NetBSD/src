.Ss "Quick install notes for the impatient"
.Pp
This section contains some brief notes describing what you need to
install
.Nx \*V
on a machine of the \*M architecture.
.Bl -bullet
.It
Fetch the
.if \n[i386]:\n[amd64] \{\
appropriate pair of boot floppy images from the
.Pa \*M/installation/floppy/
directory, or a CD-ROM image.
Most people will need the
.Pa boot1.fs
and
.Pa boot2.fs
images for VGA console installation, or the
.Pa boot-com1.fs
and
.Pa boot-com2.fs
images for installation via serial console.
.if \n[i386] \{\
You may also possibly (but not necessarily) want to use
.Pa bootlap1.fs
and
.Pa bootlap2.fs
if installing on a laptop.
.\}
.\}
.if \n[macppc] \{\
files necessary to boot your system.
The files depend on what model you
are using and how you plan to boot your machine.
For systems with built-in floppy drives (Open Firmware 1 or 2), 
fetch the pair of boot floppy images
.Pa macppc/installation/floppy/boot1.fs
and
.Pa macppc/installation/floppy/boot2.fs ,
which include the bootloader and installation kernel.
For systems without floppy drives (most are Open Firmware 3), fetch the
bootloader
.Pa macppc/installation/ofwboot.xcf
and the installation kernel
.Pa macppc/binary/kernel/netbsd-GENERIC_MD.gz .
If you have a CD-R, you can fetch the CD image,
.Pa macppccd.iso .
.\}
.if \n[sparc] \{\
CD image,
.Pa sparccd.iso
or the floppy disk images,
.Pa sparc/install/floppy/disk1.gz No and Pa sparc/install/floppy/disk2 .
You need either the pair of floppies or the CD to boot your system.
.\}
.if \n[sparc64] \{\
CD image,
.Pa sparc64cd.iso
or the installation kernel and bootloader,
.Pa sparc64/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.gz No and Pa sparc64/installation/misc/ofwboot
which can be booted from a
.Tn Solaris
or
.Nx
partition.
.\}
.if \n[macppc]:\n[sparc]:\n[sparc64] \{\
Alternatively, you may netboot the installation kernel.  This process is
covered below, in detail.
.\}
.It
The actual binary distribution is in the
.Pa \*M/binary/sets/
directory.
When you boot the install
.if \n[i386] floppies,
.if \n[macppc] kernel from floppies, hard drive, or CD-ROM,
.if \n[sparc] floppies or CD-ROM,
.if \n[sparc64] CD-ROM or installation kernel,
the installation program
can fetch these files for you (using e.g. ftp),
if you have a network connection.
There are several other methods to get the binary sets onto
your machine.
.Pp
You will at a minimum need
.ie \n[i386]:\n[amd64] \{\
one of the kernel sets, typically
.Pa kern-GENERIC.tgz ,
as well as
.\}
.el \{\
the following sets:
.Pa kern-GENERIC.tgz , 
.\}
.Pa base.tgz
and
.Pa etc.tgz .
In a typical workstation installation you will probably want
all the installation sets.
.if \n[i386] \{
.It
Write the floppy images directly to a pair of floppies.
If you have problems writing a raw image to a floppy,
the
.Ic rawrite.exe
MS-DOS program
or the
.Ic Rawrite32.exe
Windows32 program (inside
.Pa rawrite32.zip )
in the
.Pa i386/installation/misc/
directory may be of help.
.\}
.if \n[macppc] \{
.It
If your \*M has a floppy drive, create the pair of boot floppies using 
.Ic suntar
(MacOS 9),
.Ic rawrite
(Windows), or
.Ic dd
(any
.Ul
system with floppy support).  If your system has Open Firmware 3, drag
.Pa ofwboot.xcf No and Pa netbsd-GENERIC_MD.gz
to your hard drive icon (the top level of the drive, not the desktop).
If you are using the CD image, burn it now.
.\}
.if \n[sparc] \{
.It
Make sure your sparc's CD-ROM drive is bootable.
Burn the CD.
Otherwise, write the floppy images directly to a pair of floppies
(after uncompressing disk1.gz).
.\}
.if \n[sparc64] \{
.It
Burn the CD or put the installation kernel and bootloader 
at the root level of a bootable
.Tn Solaris
or
.Nx
partition.
.\}
.Pp
The disk(s) you just prepared will be used to boot the installation
kernel, which contains all the tools required to install
.Nx .
.if \n[macppc] \{\
.It
Determine your machine's model, quirks, and Open Firmware version from the
.Nx*M
Model Support webpage.
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/Ports/macppc/models.html
.Pp
At present,
.Nx*M
cannot exist on the same hard drive as
.Tn Mac OS
unless you partition your disk before running the installer.
Open Firmware versions prior to 3 require a dedicated
.Nx
drive \(em you must use the entire disk,
partitioned with the installation tools.
Open Firmware version 3 cannot boot into
.Nx
on a drive partitioned with the installation tools, you must partition
your disk before running the installer, then select the
.Dq Me "Re-install sets or install additional sets"
option in the installer (selecting the
.Dq Me "Install NetBSD to hard disk"
or
.Dq Me "Upgrade NetBSD on a hard disk"
options will render your drive unbootable).
If you are unsure, you may want to read the section below on
.Sx Partitioning your hard drive for NetBSD
.It
For systems with Open Firmware versions prior to 3, you may need to use
Apple's System Disk utility to enter Open Firmware and use your screen and
keyboard.
To enter Open Firmware, hold down the
.Key COMMAND-OPTION-O-F
keys after the boot chime starts, but before the chime ends.
Entering Open Firmware versions prior to 3 is usually the most frustrating
part of installation \(em you may want to read the section below on
.Sx Older Open Firmware System Preparation
.Pp
You should have the Open Firmware
.Dq Pa "0 \*>"
prompt on your screen before attempting to boot
.Nx*M .
.\}
.if \n[macppc] \{\
.It
At the Open Firmware prompt, type the command to boot.
To boot from the installation floppies, the command is
.Dq Ic "boot fd:0" .
For the install kernel and bootloader on your hard drive (Open Firmware
3), the command is
.Dq Ic "boot hd:,\eofwboot.xcf netbsd-GENERIC_MD.gz" .
.Pp
For boot CDs, the command is something like
.Dq Ic "boot cd:,\eofwboot.xcf netbsd.macppc"
(for Open Firmware 3) or
.Dq Ic "boot scsi-int/sd@3:0 NETBSD.MACPPC"
(for earlier Open Firmware versions).
You will need to use the correct case for
.Ic OFWBOOT.XCF No and Ic NETBSD.MACPPC
depending on how your version of Open Firmware interprets the ISO
file system.
You may need to replace
.Ic cd
with
.Ic "scsi/sd@3 , scsi-int/sd@3 , ata/atapi-disk ,"
or some other device alias.
You should also use the Open Firmware
.Ic dir
command to confirm that the
.Nx*M
kernel is called
.Pa NETBSD.MACPPC .
You may want to read the section below on
.Sx Open Firmware boot syntax
.\}
.if \n[sparc]:\n[sparc64] \{\
.It
You will need to get to the 
.if \n[sparc] OpenBoot PROM
.if \n[sparc64] OpenFirmware
.Dq Ic "ok"
prompt.
After your system first powers on, and displays some initial information,
press the
.Key STOP-A
keys, or send a BREAK if you're on a serial console.
At the
.Dq Ic "ok"
prompt, type the command to boot your system into
.Nx .
.\}
.if \n[sparc] \{\
The command to boot from CD is one of the following commands (depending on
your model):
.Dq Ic b sd(,30,) ,
.Dq Ic boot sd(,30,) ,
or
.Dq Ic boot cdrom .
.Pp
The command to boot from floppy is either
.Dq Ic boot fd(,,1)
or
.Dq Ic boot floppy .
The installer will prompt you to insert the second floppy when it is ready
for it.
.\}
.if \n[sparc64] \{\
The command to boot from CD is:
.Dq Ic boot cdrom .
The command to boot the
.Nx
kernel from a 
.Tn Solaris
or
.Nx
partition depends on which disk and partition it is on.
To boot from the first partition of the first (primary) disk:
.Dq Ic "boot disk:a /ofwboot -a" .
When it asks you for a kernel, specify
.Dq Ic "netbsd-INSTALL.gz"
.\}
.It
For third-party programs which are not part of the base
.Nx
distribution, you will want to explore the
.Ic pkgsrc
system with its more than 5400 program packages.

.Ss "What is NetBSD?"
.Pp
.
The
.Nx
Operating System is a fully functional
.Tn Open Source
.Ul
operating system derived from the University of California, Berkeley
Networking Release 2 (Net/2), 4.4BSD-Lite, and 4.4BSD-Lite2 sources.
.Nx
runs on fifty four different system architectures (ports),
featuring seventeen machine architectures
across fifteen distinct CPU families,
and is being ported to more.
The
.Nx \*V
release contains complete binary releases for many different
system architectures.
(A few ports are not fully supported at this time 
and are thus not part of the binary distribution.
For information on them, please see the
.Nx
web site at
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/ . )
.Pp
.Nx
is a completely integrated system.
In addition to its highly portable, high performance kernel,
.nh
.Nx
features a complete set of user utilities, compilers for several
languages, the X Window System, firewall software
and numerous other tools, all accompanied by full source code.
.Pp
.\" XXX Should we include some text here about NetBSD's license
.\" policies and how commercial-friendly it is?
.Nx
is a creation of the members of the Internet community.
Without the unique cooperation and coordination the net makes
possible, it's likely that
.Nx
wouldn't exist.

.Ss2 Kernel
.
.(bullet
Hold kernel_lock while calling systrace_exit().
.It
In systrace_make_msg(), sleep uninterruptibly while waiting for the response
from the systrace daemon, so that the message protocol between the kernel and
the daemon doesn't get out of sync.
.It
RAIDframe: mark used spares as failed if they encounter IO errors.
.It
.Xr wdc 4 :
after a reset don't wait for drives to come ready if there are no drives (fixes
a 30s hang after resume).
.It
Fix support in 
.Xr wd 4 
for 1 and 2TB disks.
.It
Fix a bug in the fragment cache which could cause kernel panics (SA2006-004).
.It
Fix a crash caused by
.Xr azalia 4 
when a connection list has invalid NIDs.
.It
.Xr aic 4 :
work around an rbus resource allocation problem so cards work again.
.It
RAIDframe was erroneously re-initializing the Parity Stripe Status pool each
time a new array was configured. This causes grief with things like 'vmstat -m'
by causing it to loop. Make RAIDframe only initialize PSS bits once.
.It
.Xr twe 4 :
fix a memory leak in the TWEIO_GET_PARAM ioctl.
.It
Prevent system crashes caused by malformed ELF interpreters (SA2006-008).
.It
.Xr usb 4 :
Allow a NULL pointer as argument to usb_get_next_event(), and don't allocate a
"struct usb_event" on stack in usb_add_event().
.It
Check the "oldlen" argument to
.Xr sysctl 2
before passing it to
.Xr vslock 9 .
This prevents a local DOS (SA2006-013).
.It
Use a
.Xr pmatch 9
expression which should catch all present and future seagate drives larger than
200GB for the WD_QUIRK_FORCE_LBA48 quirks.
.It
Fix the 'audioctl of death' problem (SA2006-014).
.It
Limit the size of any kernel buffers allocated by the VOP_READDIR routines to
MAXBSIZE.

.Ss2 Networking
.
.(bullet
Make sure all
.Xr bridge 4 
structs are initialized to 0.
.It
Fix a memory disclosure in
.Xr bridge 4
(SA2006-005).
.It
Use
.Xr sigaction 2
to setup automatic disposal of child processes after daemonizing
.Xr rpc.statd 8 .
This is more portable and avoids zombie
.Xr rpc.statd 8
processes after an NFS client running e.g. Mac OS X shuts down.
.It
Prevent system crash when attempting to gather information about a non-existing
alias of a network interface via the SIOCGIFALIAS ioctl (SA2006-012).
.It
Fix a panic caused by insufficient validation when parsing IPv6 socket options
(SA2006-016).
.bullet)
.
.Ss2 File system
.
.(bullet
Change union_unmount() to not play with the fs root vnode explicitly. Let it
get recycled along with all of the others. This is important as if the root
vnode has already been reclaimed, then we get a panic when we try to vget it.
.bullet)
.
.Ss2 Libraries
.
.(bullet
xdr_rec.c missing a bugfix for an improper security check. The correct way to
check for a zero record length is to check for it without the LAST_FRAG marker
in it, since it's legal to send a LAST_FRAG marker with 0 bytes of data.
.It
.Xr pam_nologin 8 :
use the class of the user, not then default class, when checking for nologin
and ignorelogin login.conf(5) capabilities.
.It
.Xr pam_unix 8 :
fix an uninitialized variable, and remove some unreachable code.
.It
Make PAM work on NetBSD ports without shared library support.
.It
Make password aging work again.
.It
Fix a bug in signal handling which could e.g get the MySQL daemon stuck in a
tight loop after receiving a HUP signal.
.bullet)
.
.Ss2 Security
.
.(bullet
Improve
.Xr rnd 4
code probing for the Intel hardware RNG to avoid false detections (SA2006-009).
.It
.Xr mail 1
creates record file with insecure umask (SA2006-007).
.It
Fix a remote code execution vulnerability in sendmail (SA2006-010).
.It
A vulnerability was found in the
.Xr fast_ipsec 4
stack that renders the IPSec anti-replay service ineffective under certain
circumstances (SA2006-011).
.It
Fix a number of small security problems with the games.

Fix an FPU Information leak on i386/amd64/Xen platforms with AMD CPUs
(SA2006-015).
.It
Fix several integer overflows and NULL-pointer dereferences in freetype2.
.It
Fix a denial of service vulnerability in sendmail when handling malformed
multipart MIME messages (SA2006-017).
.bullet)
.
.Ss2 Miscellaneous
.
.(bullet
Sync the Nvidia drivers with XFree86's sources as of December 24th, 2005.
These changes fix lots of problems (i.e. freezes) with the latest cards
(such as a GeForce 6600GT).
.It
Give systrace its own version of realpath() that does what it wants, call it
intercept_realpath().  Unbreaks systrace.
.It
.Xr login 1 ,
.Xr pam_securetty 8 :
don't issue a different message for root login on an insecure terminal.
.It
Fix some unpaired sigblocks which possibly leave a process with all signals
blocked (esp. apparant under Gnome).
.It
Fix a NULL pointer dereference in
.Xr ftp 1 .

.Ss "The Future of NetBSD"
.Pp
.
The
.Nx
Foundation has been incorporated as a non-profit
organization.
Its purpose is to encourage, foster and promote the free exchange
of computer software, namely the
.Nx
Operating
System.
The foundation will allow for many things to be handled more
smoothly than could be done with our previous informal organization.
In particular, it provides the framework to deal with other parties
that wish to become involved in the
.Nx
Project.
.Pp
The
.Nx
Foundation will help improve the quality of
.Nx
by:
.(bullet
providing better organization to keep track of development
efforts, including co-ordination with groups working in
related fields.
.It
providing a framework to receive donations of goods and
services and to own the resources necessary to run the
.Nx
Project.
.It
providing a better position from which to undertake
promotional activities.
.It
periodically organizing workshops for developers and other
interested people to discuss ongoing work.
.bullet)
.Pp
We intend to begin narrowing the time delay between releases.
Our ambition is to provide a full release every six to eight months.
.Pp
We hope to support even
.Em more
hardware in the future, and we have a
rather large number of other ideas about what can be done to improve
.Nx .
.Pp
We intend to continue our current practice of making the
NetBSD-current development source available on a daily basis.
.Pp
We intend to integrate free, positive changes from whatever sources
submit them, providing that they are well thought-out and increase the
usability of the system.
.Pp
Above all, we hope to create a stable and accessible system, and to be
responsive to the needs and desires of
.Nx
users, because it is for
and because of them that
.Nx
exists.

.tag)
.Pp
In addition to the files and directories listed above, there is one
directory per architecture, for each of the architectures for which
.Nx \*V
has a binary distribution.
.Pp
The source distribution sets can be found in subdirectories of the
.Pa source
subdirectory of the distribution tree.
They contain the complete sources to the system.
The source distribution sets are as follows:
.(tag sharesrc
.It Sy gnusrc
This set contains the
.Dq gnu
sources, including the source for the compiler, assembler, groff,
and the other GNU utilities in the binary distribution sets.
.showsize 79 367
.It Sy pkgsrc
This set contains the
.Dq pkgsrc
sources, which contain the infrastructure to build third-party packages.
.showsize 24 200
.It Sy sharesrc
This set contains the
.Dq share
sources, which include the sources for the man pages not associated
with any particular program; the sources for the typesettable document
set; the dictionaries; and more.

and
.Xr dbsym 8 .
.showsize 26 140
.It Sy xsrc
This set contains the sources to the X Window System.
.showsize 84 450
.tag)
.Pp
All the above source sets are located in the
.Pa source/sets
subdirectory of the distribution tree.
.Pp
The source sets are distributed as compressed tar files.
Except for the
.Sy pkgsrc 
set, which is traditionally unpacked into
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc ,
all sets may be unpacked into
.Pa /usr/src
with the command:
.Dl # Ic "( cd / ; tar -zxpf - ) \*< set_name.tgz"
.Pp
In each of the source distribution set directories, there are
files which contain the checksums of the files in the directory:
.(tag SYSVSUM -offset indent
.It Li BSDSUM
Historic
.Bx
checksums for the various files
in that directory, in the format produced by the command:
.br
.Ic cksum -o 1 Ar file .

checksums for the various files in that
directory, in the format produced by the command:
.br

.Ux
checksums for the various files in that directory, in the format produced by
the command:
.br
.Ic cksum -o 2 Ar file .

.Pp
The MD5 digest is the safest checksum, followed by the POSIX
checksum.
The other two checksums are provided only to ensure
that the widest possible range of system can check the integrity
of the release files.

Users upgrading from previous versions of
.Nx
may wish to bear the
following problems and compatibility issues in mind when upgrading to
.Nx \*V .
.
.Ss2 Issues affecting an upgrade from NetBSD 2.1 and older releases.
It is
.Ic very important
that you populate the directory
.Pa /etc/pam.d
with appropriate configuration files for the Pluggable Authentication Modules
(PAM) because you will not be able to login any more otherwise. Using
.Em postinstall
as described below will take care of this. Please refer to
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/guide/en/chap-pam.html
for documentation about PAM.

The following issues can generally be resolved by extracting the
.Sy etc
set into a temporary directory and running
.Em postinstall :
.(disp
postinstall -s /path/to/etc.tgz check
postinstall -s /path/to/etc.tgz fix
.disp)
.Pp
Issues fixed by
.Em postinstall :
.(bullet -offset indent
Various files in
.Pa /etc
need upgrading.
These include:
.(bullet -compact -offset indent
.Pa /etc/defaults/*
.It
.Pa /etc/mtree/*
.It
.Pa /etc/pam.d/*
.It
.Pa /etc/daily

.Pa /etc/rc.subr
.It
.Pa /etc/rc
.It
.Pa /etc/rc.shutdown
.It
.Pa /etc/rc.d/*
.bullet)
.
.Pp
The following issues need to be resolved manually:
.
.(bullet -offset indent
The user
.Sq _pflogd
 and the groups
.Sq _pflogd
and
.Sq authpf 
need to be created.
.bullet)
.
.
.Ss "Using online NetBSD documentation"
.Pp
Documentation is available if you first install the manual
distribution set.
Traditionally, the
.Dq man pages
(documentation) are denoted by
.Sq Li name(section) .
Some examples of this are
.Pp
.(bullet -compact -offset indent
.Xr intro 1 ,
.It
.Xr man 1 ,
.It
.Xr apropros 1 ,
.It
.Xr passwd 1 ,
and
.It
.Xr passwd 5 .
.bullet)
.Pp
The section numbers group the topics into several categories, but three
are of primary interest: user commands are in section 1, file formats
are in section 5, and administrative information is in section 8.
.Pp
.No The Em man
command is used to view the documentation on a topic, and is
started by entering
.Ic man Op Ar section
.Ar topic .
The brackets
.Op \&
around the
section should not be entered, but rather indicate that the section is
optional.
If you don't ask for a particular section, the topic with the
lowest numbered section name will be displayed.
For instance, after logging in, enter
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "man passwd"
.Pp
to read the documentation for
.Xr passwd 1 .
To view the documentation for
.Xr passwd 5 ,
enter
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "man 5 passwd"
.Pp
instead.
.Pp
If you are unsure of what man page you are looking for, enter
.Pp
.Ic apropos Ar subject-word
.Pp
where
.Ar subject-word
is your topic of interest; a list of possibly
related man pages will be displayed.
.
.Ss Administrivia

If you've got something to say, do so!
We'd like your input.
There are various mailing lists available via the mailing list
server at
.Mt majordomo@NetBSD.org .
To get help on using the mailing
list server, send mail to that address with an empty body, and it will
reply with instructions.
.Pp
There are various mailing lists set up to deal with comments and
questions about this release.
Please send comments to:
.Mt netbsd-comments@NetBSD.org .
.Pp
To report bugs, use the
.Xr send-pr 1
command shipped with
.Nx ,
and fill in as much information about the problem as you can.
Good bug reports include lots of details.
Additionally, bug reports can be sent by mail to:
.Mt netbsd-bugs@NetBSD.org .
.Pp
Use of
.Xr send-pr 1
is encouraged, however, because bugs reported with it
are entered into the
.Nx
bugs database, and thus can't slip through
the cracks.
.Pp
There are also port-specific mailing lists, to discuss aspects of
each port of
.Nx .
Use majordomo to find their addresses, or visit
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/MailingLists/ .
If
you're interested in doing a serious amount of work on a specific
port, you probably should contact the
.Sq owner
of that port (listed
below).
.Pp
If you'd like to help with this effort, and have an idea as to how
you could be useful, send us mail or subscribe to:
.Mt netbsd-help@NetBSD.org .
.Pp
As a favor, please avoid mailing huge documents or files to these
mailing lists.
Instead, put the material you would have sent up for FTP or WWW somewhere,
then mail the appropriate list about it, or, if you'd rather not do that,
mail the list saying you'll send the data to those who want it.
.

who've had a hand in making CVS a useful tool.
.It
The following individuals and organizations (each in alphabetical order)
have made donations or loans of hardware and/or money, to support
.Nx
development, and deserve credit for it:

We probably were not able to get in touch with you, to verify that you
wanted to be listed.)
.It
Finally, we thank all of the people who've put sweat and tears into
developing
.Nx
since its inception in January, 1993.
(Obviously, there are a lot more people who deserve thanks here.
If you're one of them, and would like to mentioned, tell us!)
