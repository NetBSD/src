.\" --------- MI instructions for getting distribution off installation medium
.\"
.\" XXX: is there any good way to handle MD quirks in MD xfer files?
.\"
.
Installation is supported from several media types, including:
.Pp
.(bullet -offset indent -compact
.
.if \n[amiga] \{\
.Tn AmigaDOS
.It
.\} \" \n[amiga]
.
CD-ROM / DVD / USB-stick
.
.It
FTP
.
.if \n[x68k] \{\
.It
Magneto-Optical (M-O) or other removable SCSI disk
.\} \" \n[x68k]
.
.It
Remote NFS partition
.
.It
Tape
.
.It
Existing
.Nx
.if \n[macppc] \{\
or
.Tn MacOS X
UFS
.\} \" \n[macppc]
partitions, if performing an upgrade
.
.bullet)
.Pp
.
The steps necessary to prepare the distribution sets for installation
depend upon which installation medium you choose.
The steps for the various media are outlined below.
.if \n[sparc64] \{\
.(Note
If you are installing the 32-bit sparc distribution sets, you will need to 
rename
.Pa sparc/binary/sets/kern-GENERIC_SUN4U.tgz
to
.Pa kern-GENERIC.tgz
since the \*M installation tools would otherwise attempt to install the 
kernel for 32-bit sparc computers which does not boot on \*M systems.
.Note)
.\}
.
.(tag CD-ROM\ /\ DVD\ /\ USB-stick
.
.if \n[amiga] \{\
.It Em AmigaDOS partition
To install
.Nx
from an
.Tn AmigaDOS
partition, you need to get the
.Nx
distribution sets you wish to install on your system on to an
.Tn AmigaDOS
partition.
.Pp
Note where you place the files as you will need this later.
.Pp
Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next
step in the installation process, preparing your hard disk.
.\} \" \n[amiga]
.
.It Em CD-ROM / DVD / USB-stick
.if \n[amiga] \{\
To install
.Nx
from a CD-ROM drive, make sure it is a SCSI CD-ROM on a SCSI bus currently
supported by
.Nx
(refer to the supported hardware list) or an ATAPI CD-ROM connected to the
A1200 or A4000 internal IDE connector.
If it is a SCSI CD-ROM on a non-supported SCSI bus like Blizzard-3 SCSI
or Apollo SCSI you must first copy the distribution sets to an
.Tn AmigaDOS
partition as described above.
.Pp
If your SCSI CD-ROM is connected to a supported SCSI host adapter,
or it is an ATAPI cd-rom connected to the A1200/A4000 internal IDE
connector, simply put the CD into the drive before installation.
.Pp
.\} \" \n[amiga]
Find out where the distribution set files are on the CD-ROM, DVD or USB stick.
Likely locations are
.Pa binary/sets
and
.Pa \*M/binary/sets .
(You only need to know this if you are mixing installer and installation
media from different versions - the installer will know the proper
default location for the sets it comes with).
.Pp
Proceed to the instructions on installation.
.
.It Em FTP
The preparations for this installation/upgrade method are
easy; all you need to do is make sure that there's an FTP
site from which you can retrieve the
.Nx
distribution when you're about to
install or upgrade.
If you don't have DHCP available on your network,
you will need to know the numeric IP address of that site, and,
if it's not on a network directly connected to the machine
on which you're installing or upgrading
.Nx ,
you need to know the numeric IP address of the router closest
to the
.Nx
machine.
Finally, you need to know the numeric IP address of the
.Nx
machine itself.
.Pp
Once you have this information, you can proceed to the next
step in the installation or upgrade process.
If you're installing
.Nx
from scratch, go to the section on preparing your hard disk, below.
If you're upgrading an existing installation, go directly to
the section on upgrading.
.
.if \n[x68k] \{\
.It Em M-O disk
To install
.Nx
from a device such as a removable SCSI disk or a magneto-optical disk,
the media
.Em must
be of the
.Tn IBM
.Em Super-floppy
format.
The
.Tn Human68k
format is not recognized by this release of the
.Nx*M .
If you have a
.Tn MS-DOS
or
.Tn MS Windows
machine with an M-O drive connected, use it.
If you don't, and if you have a program to handle
.Tn IBM
format M-O for
.Tn Human68k ,
copy all the files in the subdirectory
.Pa x68k/binaries
and
.Em "change their names to upper case".
.\} \" \n[x68k]
.
.It Em NFS
Place the
.Nx
distribution sets you wish to install into a
directory on an NFS server, and make that directory mountable
by the machine on which you are installing or upgrading
.Nx .
This will probably require modifying the
.Pa /etc/exports
file on the NFS server and resetting its mount daemon (mountd).
(Both of these actions will probably require superuser
privileges on the server.)
.Pp
You need to know the numeric IP address of the NFS server,
and, if you don't have DHCP available on your network and
the server is not on a network directly connected to
the machine on which you're installing or upgrading
.Nx ,
you need to know the numeric IP address of the router closest
to the
.Nx
machine.
Finally, you need to know the numeric IP address of the
.Nx
machine itself.
.Pp
Once the NFS server is set up properly and you have the
information mentioned above, you can proceed to the next step
in the installation or upgrade process.
If you're installing
.Nx
from scratch, go to the section on preparing your hard disk, below.
If you're upgrading an existing installation, go directly to the
section on upgrading.
.
.It Em Tape
To install
.Nx
from a tape, you need to make a tape that
contains the distribution set files, in
.Sq tar
format.
.if \n[pmax]:\n[vax] \{\
.(Note
the tape devices with which
.Nx*M
is believed to work is the
.Tn DEC
TK-50.
This is a very slow device.
Installation via disk or network is recommended if possible.
.Note)
.\} \" \n[pmax]:\n[vax]
.Pp
If you're making the tape on a
.Ul
system, the easiest way
to do so is probably something like:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "tar -cf" Ar "tape_device dist_sets"
.Pp
where
.Ar tape_device
is the name of the tape device that
represents the tape drive you're using.
This might be
.Pa /dev/rst0 ,
or something similar, but it will vary from system to system.
In the above example,
.Ar dist_sets
is a list of filenames corresponding to the distribution sets that you
wish to place on the tape.
For instance, to put the
.Sy kern-GENERIC, base, No and Sy etc
distributions on tape (the absolute minimum required for installation),
you would do the following:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "cd \&.../NetBSD-\*V"
.Dl # Ic "cd \*M/binary"
.Dl # Ic "tar -cf" Ar tape_device Ic "kern-GENERIC.tgz base.tgz etc.tgz"
.Pp
.(Note
You still need to fill in
.Ar tape_device No in the example.
.Note)
.Pp
Once you have the files on the tape, you can proceed to the
next step in the installation or upgrade process.
If you're installing
.Nx
from scratch, go to the section on preparing your hard disk, below.
If you're upgrading an existing installation, go directly to the section
on upgrading.
