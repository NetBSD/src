Installation is supported from several media types, including:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
CDROM
.It
DOS Floppy
.It
Tape
.It
Remote NFS partition
.It
FTP
.El
.if r_arm32 \{\
.	Pp
No matter which installation medium you choose, you'll need to have an
installation kernel and possibly a boot application, see
.	Li arm32/ Ns Ar platform Ns Li /prep
for details.
.\}
.Pp
Note that, if you are installing or upgrading from a writable media,
the media can be write-protected if you wish. These systems mount a
root image from inside the kernel, and will not need to write to the
media.
.Pp
The distribution sets for
installation or upgrade depend on which installation medium you
choose.  The steps for the various media are outlined below.
.Bl -bullet
.It
To install or upgrade NetBSD using CDROM, you need to do the
following:
.Pp
Find out where the distribution set files are on the CDROM.
.Pp
Proceed to the instruction on installation.
.It
To install or upgrade NetBSD using DOS floppies, you need to do the
following:
.Pp
Count the number of "set_name.xx" files that make up the
distribution sets you want to install or upgrade.  You will
need that number of 1.44M floppies.
.Pp
Format all of the floppies with DOS.  DO NOT make any of them
bootable DOS floppies.  (If the floppies are bootable, then
the DOS system files that make them bootable will take up
some space, and you won't be able to fit the distribution set
parts on the disks.) If you're using floppies that are
formatted for DOS by their manufacturers, they probably
aren't bootable, and you can use them out of the box.
.Pp
Place all of the "set_name.xx" files on the DOS disks.
.Pp
Once you have the files on DOS disks, you can proceed to the
next step in the installation or upgrade process.  If you're
installing NetBSD from scratch, go to the section on preparing
your hard disk, below.  If you're upgrading an existing
installation, go directly to the section on upgrading.
.It
To install or upgrade NetBSD using a tape, you need to do the
following:
.Pp
To install NetBSD from a tape, you need to make a tape that
contains the distribution set files, in "tar" format.  If
you're making the tape on a UN*X-like system, the easiest way
to do so is probably something like:
.Li tar cf Ar tape_device dist_directories
.No where Ar tape_device
is the name of the tape device that
describes the tape drive you're using (possibly
.Pa /dev/rst0 ,
or something similar, but it will vary from system to system.
(If you can't figure it out, ask your system administrator.)
In the above example,
.Ar dist_directories
are the
distribution sets' directories, for the distribution sets you
wish to place on the tape.  For instance, to put the
.Sy misc, base, No and Sy etc
distributions on tape (in
order to do the absolute minimum installation to a new disk),
you would do the following:
.D1 Ic "cd \&.../NetBSD-\*V         # the top of the tree
.D1 Ic "cd \*[MACHINE]/binary
And then:\ \~
.D1 tar \&cf Ar tape_device Ic misc etc kern
.Pp
.(Note
You still need to fill in 
.Ar tape_device No in the example.
.Note)
.Pp
Once you have the files on the tape, you can proceed to the
next step in the installation or upgrade process.  If you're
installing NetBSD from scratch, go to the section on preparing
your hard disk, below.  If you're upgrading an existing
installation, go directly to the section on upgrading.
.It
To install or upgrade NetBSD using a remote partition, mounted via
NFS, you must do the following:
.(Note
This method of installation is recommended only for
those already familiar with using BSD network
configuration and management commands.  If you aren't,
this documentation should help, but is not intended to
be all-encompassing.
.Note)
.Pp
Place the NetBSD distribution sets you wish to install into a
directory on an NFS server, and make that directory mountable
by the machine on which you are installing or upgrading NetBSD.
This will probably require modifying the /etc/exports file on
of the NFS server and resetting its mount daemon (mountd).
(Both of these actions will probably require superuser
privileges on the server.)
.Pp
You need to know the numeric IP address of the NFS server,
and, if the server is not on a network directly connected to
the machine on which you're installing or upgrading NetBSD,
you need to know the numeric IP address of the router closest
to the NetBSD machine.  Finally, you need to know the numeric
IP address of the NetBSD machine itself.
.Pp
Once the NFS server is set up properly and you have the
information mentioned above, you can proceed to the next step
in the installation or upgrade process.  If you're installing
NetBSD from scratch, go to the section on preparing your hard
disk, below.  If you're upgrading an existing installation, go
directly to the section on upgrading.
.It
To install or upgrade NetBSD by using FTP to get the installation
sets, you must do the following:
.Pp
.(Note
This method of installation is recommended only for
those already familiar with using BSD network
configuration and management commands.  If you aren't,
this documentation should help, but is not intended to
be all-encompassing.
.Note)
.Pp
The preparations for this installation/upgrade method are
easy; all you make sure that there's some FTP site from which
you can retrieve the NetBSD distribution when you're about to
install or upgrade.  You need to know the numeric IP address
of that site, and, if it's not on a network directly connected
to the machine on which you're installing or upgrading NetBSD,
you need to know the numeric IP address of the router closest
to the NetBSD machine.  Finally, you need to know the numeric
IP address of the NetBSD machine itself.
.Pp
Once you have this information, you can proceed to the next
step in the installation or upgrade process.  If you're
installing NetBSD from scratch, go to the section on
preparing your hard disk, below.  If you're upgrading an
existing installation, go directly to the section on
upgrading.
.It
If you are upgrading NetBSD, you also have the option of installing
NetBSD by putting the new distribution sets somewhere in your existing
file system, and using them from there.  To do that, you must do the
following:
.Pp
Place the distribution sets you wish to upgrade somewhere in
your current file system tree.
.if !r_pmax \{\
Please note that the /dev on
the floppy used for upgrades only knows about wd0, wd1, sd0,
sd1 and sd2. If you have more than two IDE drives or more than
three SCSI drives, you should take care not to place the sets
on the high numbered drives.
.\}
.Pp
At a bare minimum, you must upgrade the "base" binary
distribution, and so must put the "base" set somewhere in
your file system.  If you wish, you can do the other sets, as
well, but you should NOT upgrade the "etc" distribution; the
"etc" distribution contains system configuration files that
you should review and update by hand.
.Pp
Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next step in
the upgrade process, actually upgrading your system.
.El
