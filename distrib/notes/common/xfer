This image is tailored towards old, small-memory systems, and thus does
not contain any PCI or SCSI support.
It should work on systems with 4M of RAM.
Note that this means 4M available to NetBSD; systems that
are said to have 4M may have 640k of base memory and 3072k of extended
memory, which currently will not work, as this is a total of 3712k.

For the 2-floppy sets (and the CD boot image), utilities to repair
a badly crashed systems are included.
The -small and -tiny images have separate rescue floppy images because

If you have less than 5MB of memory, you have to use the
`floppy-root' installation system instead of the above
`ramdisk-root' installation system.
`Floppy-root' installation
system is composed of two floppies, `kern' and `inst'.
They are made from the floppy images
.Pa kern.fs
and
.Pa inst.fs
respectively, both of which are found in
.Pa installation/floppy
directory of the
.Nx

See above how to write the images to floppies.

To start the `floppy-root' installation system, insert the `kern' floppy
to your floppy drive 0, and reboot your computer with OPT.1 key pressed.
When you are prompted that `Insert filesystem floppy and press return.',
replace the `kern' floppy with `inst' floppy and press return key.
.Pp
Once booted, the `floppy-root' installation system is identical with
the `ramdisk-root' installation system, except that the former constantly
accesses the floppy disk.
Floppy disks are relatively unreliable media and cause some warning messages
to report access errors, most of which are corrected and can be ignored.
With the latter installation system the floppy disk is not used once the
system has booted off and can be removed from the drive.
