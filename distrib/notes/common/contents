.Ss2 Bootable installation/upgrade floppies
.Pp
There are three bootable images in the
.Nx
\*M distribution.
One is for a dual-floppy boot and is split into two separate files.
The other is a single-file image containing the same install kernel,
but intended to be written to a CD, tape, or hard drive. The third
image is a
.Li GENERIC
kernel intended for production use in unusual cases.
This can be useful at some sites when:
.(bullet
You want to run diskless but SRM bugs prevent the firmware from
netbooting. You can work around this problem by always booting the generic
kernel from the floppy.
.It
SRM doesn't recognize your (hard) disk controller but
.Nx
does. This
happens more frequently than you might think. SRM will usually only boot
from
.Xr ncr 4
or
.Xr isp 4
SCSI devices, and on most platforms will not
boot from an IDE drive.
.Nx
will happily operate
with almost any SCSI root or an IDE root; the solution here is to netboot
a kernel or always boot from floppy.
.bullet)
.\}
.
.
.if r_amiga \{\
.Ss2 Miniroot file system
The Amiga now uses a single miniroot filesystem for both an initial
installation and for an upgrade. A gzipped version is available, for easier
downloading. (The gzipped version has the
.Sy \&.gz
extension added to
their names.)
.(tag miniroot.fs
.It Pa miniroot.fs
This file contains a BSD root file system setup to help you
install the rest of
.Nx
or to upgrade a previous version of
.Nx .
This includes formatting and mounting your root and
/usr partitions and getting ready to extract (and possibly first
fetching) the distribution sets. There is enough on this file
system to allow you to make a SLIP or PPP connection, configure
an Ethernet, mount an NFS file system or ftp. You can also load
distribution sets from a SCSI tape or from one of your existing
AmigaDOS partitions.
.tag)
.\}
.
.
.if r_arm32 \{\
There are a collection of arm32 kernels in the
.Pa arm32/kernels
subdirectory of the
.Nx \*V
distribution. Some of these kernels
contain a root file system image and should only be used for the
initial installation. Some of the kernels only support a particular
subset of the platforms that arm32 supports (See
.Pa arm32/kernels/README
for more details.)
.\}
.
.
.if r_mvme68k \{\
.Pp
The
.Nx*M
install distribution contains files that can be
used to install
.Nx
onto completely "bare" MVME147 and MVME167
boards. The files
in the
.Pa mvme68k/installation
directories are described below.
.(tag netbsd-rd.gz
.It Pa miniroot.gz
A gzipped copy of the miniroot filesystem.
This image is to be un-gzipped and copied
into the swap area of a disk.
.It Pa netbsd-rd.gz
A gzipped copy of the
.Li RAMDISK
kernel for installing the miniroot filesystem.
.It Pa stboot
A tape boot-block, in the form required to
allow 1x7-Bug to boot from tape. This is the
first segment of a boot tape.
.It Pa bootst
A copy of the tape boot program, used
as the second segment of a boot tape.
.It Pa sboot
A copy of the MVME147 serial boot program. This is
necessary if you don't have a tape drive,
but you _do_ have another system which can
act as a boot and NFS server. This is also
useful if you are installing a diskless
.Nx
system on an MVME147 board.
.It Pa netboot
A copy of the network boot program. Used
in conjunction with sboot on the MVME147 to get your system
booted over a network. The MVME167 can boot this file
directly using 167Bug's builtin TFTP client.
.tag)
.Pp
These files can be used to make a boot tape suitable for installing
.Nx*M .
These files can also be used to configure an NFS server
to support installation "over the network". See the section
.Sx Getting the
.Nx
System onto Useful Media
for instructions on either method.

.
.
.Ss2 Binary distribution sets
The
.Nx
\*M
binary distribution sets contain the binaries which
comprise the
.Nx \*V
release for the \*M. There are eight binary distribution sets.
The binary distribution sets can be found in the
.Pa \*M/binary/sets
subdirectory
of the
.Nx \*V
distribution tree, and are as follows:
.(tag xcontrib
.
.It Sy base
The
.Nx \*V
.No \*M Sy base No binary distribution. You
.Em must
install this distribution set. It contains the base
.Nx
utilities that are necessary for the
system to run and be minimally functional. It
includes shared library support, and excludes
everything described below.

.\"============================ MI DISCUSSION OF BINARY SETS
.
.
.Pp
The \*M binary distribution sets are distributed as gzipped tar files
named with the extension
.Sy .tgz , No e.g.
.Pa base.tgz .

.
.if r_i386 \{\

.\}
.
.
.Pp
The instructions given for extracting the source sets work equally
well for the binary sets, but it is worth noting that if you use that
method, the files are /-relative and
therefore are extracted
.Em below
the current directory. That
is, if you want to extract the binaries into your system, i.e.
replace the system binaries with them, you have to run the
.Ic tar xfp
command from /.

Additional kernels to those included in the distribution sets may be found
in the

.Li HADES .
.It Em Installation\ floppy:
This disk contains a BSD root file system setup to help
you install the rest of
.Nx .
This includes formatting
and mounting your root and /usr partitions and getting
ready to extract (and possibly first fetching) the distribution
sets. There is enough on this file system to allow you to
make a slip connection, configure an ethernet, mount an NFS
file system or ftp. You can also load distribution sets from
a SCSI tape or from one of your existing GEMDOS partitions.
.Pp
The floppies meant for 720 KB disks are named
.Pa miniroot.fs.1 No and Pa miniroot.fs.2 .
There is also an image for an 1.44 MB disk:
.Pa miniroot.fs .
.tag)
.Pp
There are also TOS utilities in the
.Pa atari/installation/misc
subdirectory, which you will need to get
.Nx*M
'up-and-running'.
.(bullet
The
.Dq gzip.ttp
program allows you to uncompress .gz images. The
usage is "gzip.ttp -d filename.gz".
.It
The
.Dq rawwrite.ttp
program allows you to create the installation
floppy disks from the files in the
.Pa atari/floppies
directory.
.It
The "aptck.ttp" program reads the partition tables present on a
given disk and tries to interpret then the same way the
.Nx
kernel does. If you have a disk on which GEMDOS and
.Nx
are to co-exist, It is a good idea to run this before you begin the
.Nx*M
installation just to check that the kernel's view
of the partition tables agree with GEMDOS's view. If you have
more than 3 partitions defined on a disk you will notice that
the
.Nx*M
partition starts one sector after the GEMDOS
partition. This is to allow space for the auxilliary root for
the 4th and subsequent partitions.
.It
The "loadbsd.ttp" program loads the
.Nx*M
kernel from TOS
(or MiNT, MultiTOS, etc.).
