.Ss2 Bootable installation/upgrade floppies:
.Pp
There are three bootable images in the
.Nx
\*m distribution.
One is for a dual-floppy boot and is split into two separate files.
The other is a single-file image containing the same install kernel,
but intended to be written to a CD, tape, or hard drive. The third
image is a
.Tn GENERIC
kernel intended for production use in unusual cases.
This can be useful at some sites when:
.Bl -bullet
.It
You want to run diskless but SRM bugs prevent the firmware from
netbooting. You can work around this problem by always booting the generic
kernel from the floppy.
.It
SRM doesn't recognize your (hard) disk controller but
.Nx
does. This
happens more frequently than you might think. SRM will usually only boot
from
.Xr ncr 4
or
.Xr isp 4
SCSI devices, and on most platforms will not
boot from an IDE drive.
.Nx
will happily operate
with almost any SCSI root or an IDE root; the solution here is to netboot
a kernel or always boot from floppy.

.Ss2 Miniroot file system
The Amiga now uses a single miniroot filesystem for both an initial
installation and for an upgrade. A gzipped version is available, for easier
downloading. (The gzipped version has the

extension added to
their names.)
.(tag Pa miniroot.fs
This file contains a BSD root file system setup to help you
install the rest of
.Nx
or to upgrade a previous version of
.Nx .
This includes formatting and mounting your root and
/usr partitions and getting ready to extract (and possibly first
fetching) the distribution sets. There is enough on this file
system to allow you to make a SLIP or PPP connection, configure
an Ethernet, mount an NFS file system or ftp. You can also load
distribution sets from a SCSI tape or from one of your existing
AmigaDOS partitions.

first segment of a boot tape.

as the second segment of a boot tape.
.It Pa sboot
A copy of the serial boot program. This is
necessary if you don't have a tape drive,
but you _do_ have another system which can
act as a boot and NFS server. This is also
useful if you are installing a diskless
NetBSD/mvme68k system.
.It Pa netboot
A copy of the network boot program. Used
in conjunction with sboot to get your system
booted over a network.

These files can be used to make a boot tape suitable for installing
NetBSD/mvme68k. These files can also be used to configure an NFS server
to support installation "over the network". See the section

.\"============================ MI DISCUSSION OF BINARY SETS
.
.Pp
The \*m binary distribution sets are distributed as gzipped tar files
named with the extension
.Sy .tgz , No e.g.
.Pa base.tgz .
.
.
.\" contrary to most old INSTALL docs, only i386 has Split/ sets
.
.
.if r_i386 \{\
They are also
available in split form \- catted together, the members of a split set
form a gzipped tar file.
.\}
.
.
.Pp
The instructions given for extracting the source sets work equally
well for the binary sets, but it is worth noting that if you use that
method, the files are /-relative and
therefore are extracted
.Em below
the current directory. That
is, if you want to extract the binaries into your system, i.e.
replace the system binaries with them, you have to run the
.Ic tar xfp
command from /.
.
.
.
.
.if r_atari \{\
.Pp
Additional kernels to those included in the distribution sets may be found
in the
.Pa atari/binary/kernel
subdirectory of the
.Nx \*V
distribution tree. These kernels are generally named something like
.Pa netbsd.BOOT.gz
or some other suitable name. Please note that these kernels are simply
gzipped and are not in tar archives.
.Pp
There are three atari floppy images to be found in the
.Pa atari/installation/floppies
subdirectory of the
.Nx \*V
distribution. One of them is a bootable TOS kernel floppy and the other
two are installation floppies. They are described in more detail below.
There are gzipped versions of each available, for easier downloading.
(The gzipped versions have the
.Pa \&.gz
extension added to their names.)
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Em Bootable\ Kernel\ floppy
This TOS disk contains the loadbsd and chg_pid programs
and a kernel. It is setup so that you can insert it
int your floppy drive, and start the programs from GEM.
.Pp
For the TT030 and Falcon, the floppy is named boot-_SVER_S.fs and
the kernel supplied is 'BOOT'. For the Hades, you need the
hades-boot-_SVER_S.fs floppy. The kernel is 'HADES'.
.It Em Installation\ floppy:
This disk contains a BSD root file system setup to help
you install the rest of NetBSD. This includes formatting
and mounting your root and /usr partitions and getting
ready to extract (and possibly first fetching) the distribution
sets. There is enough on this file system to allow you to
make a slip connection, configure an ethernet, mount an NFS
file system or ftp. You can also load distribution sets from
a SCSI tape or from one of your existing GEMDOS partitions.
.Pp
These floppies are named
.Pa miniroot.fs.1 No and Pa miniroot.fs.2 .
.El
.Pp
There are also TOS utilities in the
.Pa atari/installation/misc
subdirectory, which you will need to get NetBSD/Atari 'up-and-running'.
.Bl -bullet
.It
The
.Dq gzip.ttp
program allows you to uncompress .gz images. The
usage is "gzip.ttp -d filename.gz".
.It
The
.Dq rawwrite.ttp
program allows you to create the installation
floppy disks from the files in the
.Pa atari/floppies
directory.
.It
The "aptck.ttp" program reads the partition tables present on a
given disk and tries to interpret then the same way the NetBSD
kernel does. If you have a disk on which GEMDOS and
.Nx
are to co-exist, It is a good idea to run this before you begin the
NetBSD/Atari installation just to check that the kernel's view
of the partition tables agree with GEMDOS's view. If you have
more than 3 partitions defined on a disk you will notice that
the NetBSD/\*m partition starts one sector after the GEMDOS
partition. This is to allow space for the auxilliary root for
the 4th and subsequent partitions.

The "loadbsd.ttp" program loads the NetBSD/\*m kernel from TOS
(or MiNT, MultiTOS, etc.).
