.Ss2 Bootable installation/upgrade floppies
.Pp
There are three bootable images in the
.Nx
\*M distribution.
One is for a floppy boot and is split into three separate files.
The other is a single-file image containing the same install kernel,
but intended to be written to a CD, tape, or hard drive.
The third image is a
.Li GENERIC
kernel intended for production use in unusual cases.
This can be useful at some sites when:
.(bullet
You want to run diskless but SRM bugs prevent the firmware from
netbooting.
You can work around this problem by always booting the generic
kernel from the floppy.
.It
SRM doesn't recognize your (hard) disk controller but
.Nx
does.
This happens more frequently than you might think.
SRM will usually only boot from
.Xr siop 4
or
.Xr isp 4
SCSI devices, and on most platforms will not
boot from an IDE drive.
.Nx
will happily operate
with almost any SCSI root or an IDE root; the solution here is to netboot
a kernel or always boot from floppy.

partitions and getting ready to extract (and possibly first
fetching) the distribution sets.
There is enough on this file system to allow you to make a SLIP or

If you want to install 32-bit only binaries, you will 
still need to boot using the sparc64 installation tools.  When sysinst
asks you for the distribution set to install, provide the
.Nx Ns /sparc

Be sure to use the 32 bit sparc
.Pa kern-GENERIC_SUN4U.tgz 
kernel distribution.  Otherwise, continue to follow the \*M installation
procedure, not the sparc instructions.

.
.
.Pp
The \*M binary distribution sets are distributed as gzipped tar files
named with the extension
.Sy .tgz ,
e.g.
.Pa base.tgz .
.
.
.Pp
The instructions given for extracting the source sets work equally
well for the binary sets, but it is worth noting that if you use that
method, the filenames stored in the sets are relative and therefore
the files are extracted
.Em below the current directory .
Therefore, if you want to extract the binaries into your system, i.e.
replace the system binaries with them, you have to run the
.Ic "tar -xzpf"
command from the root directory (
.Pa / 
) of your system.
.

Additional kernels to those included in the distribution sets may be found
in the

subdirectory of the

\*V distribution tree.
These kernels are generally named something like

or some other suitable name.
Please note that these kernels are simply gzipped and are not in tar archives.
.Pp
There are six atari floppy images to be found in the
.Pa atari/installation/floppies
subdirectory of the
.Nx
\*V distribution.
Three of them are bootable
.Tn TOS
kernel floppies and the other
three are installation floppies.
They are described in more detail below.
There are gzipped versions of each available, for easier downloading.
(The gzipped versions have the
.Pa \&.gz

.It Em Bootable\ Kernel\ floppies
These
.Tn TOS
disks contains the
.Tn TOS
support programs (like
.Ic loadbsd.ttp
and
.Ic chg_pid.ttp
\(em see below) and a kernel.
They are setup such that you can insert them into
your floppy drive, and start the programs from GEM.
.Pp
For the TT030 and Falcon, the (720 KB) floppy is named
.Pa boot.fs
and
the kernel supplied is
.Li BOOT .
For the Hades, you need the
.Pa hades-boot.fs
floppy (1.44 MB), the kernel is
.Li HADES .
For the Milan, you need the
.Pa milan-boot.fs
floppy (1.44 MB), the kernel is MILAN-PCIIDE.
.It Em Installation\ floppy:
This disk contains a
.Bx
root file system setup to help
you install the rest of
.Nx .
This includes formatting
and mounting your
.Pa /
(root) and
.Pa /usr
partitions and getting
ready to extract (and possibly first fetching) the distribution
sets.
There is enough on this file system to allow you to
make a slip connection, configure an ethernet, mount an NFS
file system or ftp.
You can also load distribution sets from a SCSI tape or from one of
your existing
.Tn GEMDOS
partitions.
.Pp
The floppies meant for 720 KB disks are named
.Pa miniroot.fs.1
and
.Pa miniroot.fs.2 .
There is also an image for an 1.44 MB disk:
.Pa miniroot.fs .
.tag) \" atari
.Pp
There are also
.Tn TOS
utilities in the
.Pa atari/installation/misc
subdirectory, which you will need to get
.Nx*M
up-and-running.
.(bullet
The
.Ic gzip.ttp
program allows you to uncompress .gz images.
The usage is:
.Pp
.Dl Ic "gzip.ttp -d filename.gz"
.It
The
.Ic rawwrite.ttp
program allows you to create the installation
floppy disks from the files in the
.Pa atari/floppies
directory.
.It
The
.Ic aptck.ttp
program reads the partition tables present on a
given disk and tries to interpret then the same way the
.Nx
kernel does.
If you have a disk on which
.Tn GEMDOS
and
.Nx
are to co-exist, It is a good idea to run this before you begin the
.Nx*M
installation just to check that the kernel's view
of the partition tables agree with
.Tn GEMDOS Ns 's
view.
If you have more than 3 partitions defined on a disk you will notice that the
.Nx*M
partition starts one sector after the
.Tn GEMDOS
partition.
This is to allow space for the auxiliary root for
the 4th and subsequent partitions.
.It
The
.Ic loadbsd.ttp
program loads the
.Nx*M
kernel from
.Tn TOS
(or
.Tn MiNT ,
.Tn MultiTOS ,
etc.).
.It
The
.Ic chg_pid.ttp
program can be used to change the id of an
.Tn AHDI
compatible partition.
This allows you to reserve a partition for use by
.Nx*M
(id: NBD), or for use as a swap (id: SWP) partition.
.It
The
.Ic file2swp.ttp
program can be used to transfer an installation file system image, like
.Pa sysinst.fs
to a partition with id SWP.
In this way, you can run the installation from the swap partition
instead of a memory disk.
This is a necessity for small memory systems.

The

.Em and will be removed in a future release.
Some other important differences between the two installation methods are:
.(bullet
The Installer and Mkfs utilities are not used if the installation is done
using the
.Ic sysinst
method via booting an Installation Kernel.
.It
Mkfs creates a 4.3BSD "old" format file system.
This is the only file system format understood by the Installer.
The
.Ic sysinst
process creates "new" file systems which can't be processed by Mkfs
or the Installer.
.It
The Installer (and probably Mkfs) is known to have problems with
BSD file systems that are larger than 1 GB or extend beyond the 1 GB
physical limit.
Keep this in mind if doing a Traditional method
installation with these utilities.
.It
The Booter is known to have problems booting from a NetBSD file system
if the inode of the kernel file is too large.
For large disks it is advisable to have a small root partition and one or
more usr-type partitions for other files.
This ensures the inode of the kernel in the root file system will be small.
.It
The Booter is designed to work with 4.3BSD "old" file systems, but there
are enough similarities between the "old" and "new" file system formats in the
first few hundred blocks that the Booter can usually boot a Kernel from a
4.3BSD new file system.
If you choose to use "new" file system formats, it is advisable to use a
small root partition and one or more usr-type partitions for other files.
This is the default layout used by
.Ic sysinst .
