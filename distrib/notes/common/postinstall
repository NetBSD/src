Once you've got the operating system running, there are a few
things you need to do in order to bring the system into a properly
configured state, with the most important ones described below.
.Bl -enum
.It
Configuring
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
.Pp
If you or the installation software haven't done any configuration of
.Pa /etc/rc.conf ,
the system will drop you into single user mode on first reboot with the
message
.Dl /etc/rc.conf is not configured. Multiuser boot aborted.
and with the root filesystem mounted read-write. When the system
asks you to choose a shell, simply hit return to get to a
prompt. If you are asked for a terminal type, respond with
.ie r_pmax \{\
the correct terminal type as discussed in the
.Sx Once you've booted the diskimage
section.
.\}
.el \{\
.Ic vt220
(or whatever is appropriate for your terminal type)
.\}
and hit return. At this point, you need to configure at least
one file in the
.Pa /etc No directory. Change to the
.Pa /etc
directory and take a look at the
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
file. Modify it to your tastes, making sure that you set
.Li rc_configured=YES
so that your changes will be enabled and a multi-user boot can
proceed. If your
.Pa /usr No directory is on a separate partition
and you do not know how to use 'ed' or 'ex', you will have to mount your
.Pa /usr
partition to gain access to 'vi'. Do the following:
.ie r_pmax \{\
.D1 Ic "mount /usr
.D1 Ic "export TERM=termtype
.\}
.el \{\
.D1 Ic "mount /usr
.D1 Ic "export TERM=vt220
.\}
If you have
.Pa /var
on a seperate partition, you need to repeat
that step for it. After that, you can edit
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
with
.Xr vi 1 .
When you have finished, type
.Ic exit
at the prompt to
leave the single-user shell and continue with the multi-user boot.
.Pp
Other values that need to be set in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
for a networked environment are
.Ar hostname No and possibly
.Ar defaultroute ,
furthermore add an
.Ar ifconfig_int
for your interface
.Aq int ,
along the lines of
.ie r_pmax .Dl ifconfig_le0="inet 123.45.67.89 netmask 255.255.255.0"
.el .Dl ifconfig_de0="inet 123.45.67.89 netmask 255.255.255.0"
or, if you have
.Ar myname.my.dom No in Pa /etc/hosts :
.ie r_pmax .Dl ifconfig_le0="inet myname.my.dom netmask 255.255.255.0"
.el .Dl ifconfig_de0="inet myname.my.dom netmask 255.255.255.0"
To enable proper hostname resolution, you will also want to add an
.Pa /etc/resolv.conf
file or (if you are feeling a little more adventurous) run
.Xr named 8 .
See
.Xr resolv.conf 5
or
.Xr named 8
for more information.
.Pp
Other files in
.Pa /etc
that may require modification or setting up include
.Pa /etc/mailer.conf ,
.Pa /etc/nsswitch.conf
and
.Pa /etc/wscons.conf .
.It
Logging in
.Pp
After reboot, you can log in as
.Li root
at the login prompt. There
is no initial password, but if you're using the machine in a
networked environment, you should create an account for yourself
(see below) and protect it and the "root" account with good
passwords.
Unless you have connected an unusual terminal device as the console
you can just press RETURN when it prompts for
.Li Terminal type? [...]
.
.It
Adding accounts
.Pp
Use the
.Xr useradd 8
command to add accounts to your system,
.Em do not No edit Pa /etc/passwd
directly. See
.Xr useradd 8
for more information on the process of how to add a new user to the system.
.It
The X Window System
.Pp
If you have installed the X window system, look at the files in
.Pa /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc
for information.
.if \n[arm32]:\n[i386] \{\
.Pp
You will need to set up a configuration file, see
.Pa /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config.eg
for an example.  See
.Lk http://www.xfree86.org/
and the XFree86 manual page for more information.
.\}
.Pp
Don't forget to add
.Pa /usr/X11R6/bin
to your path in your shell's dot file so that you have access to the X binaries.
.It
Installing 3rd party packages
.Pp
If you wish to install any of the software freely available for unix systems
you are strongly advised to first check the
.Nx
package system. This automatically handles any changes necessary to
make the software run on
.Nx ,
retrieval and installation of any other packages on which the software
may depend, and simplifies installation (and deinstallation), both
from source and precompiled binaries.
.Bl -bullet
.It
More information on the package system is at
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/software/packages.html
.It
A browsable listing of available packages is at
.Lk ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc/README.html
.It
Precompiled binaries can be found at
.Lk ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/
.It
Package sources for compiling packages can be obtained by
retrieving the file
.Lk ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/tar_files/pkgsrc.tar.gz
They are typically extracted into
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc
(though other locations work fine), as with the command:
.D1 Ic "cat pkgsrc.tar.gz | gunzip | (mkdir /usr/pkgsrc; 
.D1 Ic "cd /usr/pkgsrc; tar xpf - )
After extracting, then see the
.Pa README
file in the extraction directory (e.g.
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc/README )
for more information.

.It
Misc
.Bl -bullet
.It
To adjust the system to your local timezone, point the
.Pa /etc/localtime
symlink to the appropriate file under
.Pa /usr/share/zoneinfo .
.It
Edit
.Pa /etc/mail/aliases
to forward root mail to the right place (run
.Xr newaliases 1
afterwards.)
.It
The
.Pa /etc/mail/sendmail.cf
file will almost definitely need to be adjusted;
files aiding in this can be found in
.Pa /usr/share/sendmail .
See the
.Li Tn README
file there for more information.
.It
Edit
.Pa /etc/rc.local
to run any local daemons you use.
.It
Many of the
.Pa /etc
files are documented in section 5 of the manual; so just invoking
.D1 Ic man Ar filename
is likely to give you more information on these files.
