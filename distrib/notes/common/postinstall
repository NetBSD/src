Once you've got the operating system running, there are a few
things you need to do in order to bring the system into a properly
configured state.
The most important steps are described below.
.(enum
Before all else, read
.Xr postinstall 8 .
.It
Configuring
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
.Pp
If you or the installation software haven't done any configuration of
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
.Ic ( sysinst
normally will),
the system will drop you into single user mode on first reboot with the
message
.Pp
.Dl /etc/rc.conf is not configured. Multiuser boot aborted.
.Pp
and with the root file system
.Pq Pa /
mounted read-only.
When the system asks you to choose a shell, simply press
.Key RETURN
to get to a
.Pa /bin/sh
prompt.
If you are asked for a terminal type, respond with
.
.ds termtype vt220
.
.ie \n[hp300] \{\
.ds termtype hp300h
.Ic \*[termtype]
for a local console, or whatever is appropriate for your serial console.
.\}
.el \{\
.ie \n[macppc] \{\
.ds termtype vt100
.Ic \*[termtype]
(or whatever is appropriate for your terminal type)
.\}
.el \{\
.ie \n[pmax] \{\
.ds termtype termtype
the correct terminal type as discussed in the
.Sx Once you've booted the diskimage
section.
.\}
.el \{\
.ie \n[sparc]:\n[sparc64] \{\
.ds termtype sun
.Ic \*[termtype]
for a local console, or whatever is appropriate for your serial
console (some systems display garbage with a
.Ic \*[termtype]
terminal type, you may need to use
.Ic sun-ss5 )
.ds termtype sun
.\}
.el \{\
.Ic \*[termtype]
(or whatever is appropriate for your terminal type)
.\}
.\}
.\}
.\}
and press
.Key RETURN .
You may need to type one of the following commands to get your delete key
to work properly, depending on your keyboard:
.Dl # Ic "stty erase '^h'"
.Dl # Ic "stty erase '^?'"
At this point, you need to configure at least
one file in the
.Pa /etc
directory.
You will need to mount your root file system read/write with:
.Dl # Ic "/sbin/mount -u -w /"
Change to the
.Pa /etc
directory and take a look at the
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
file.
Modify it to your tastes, making sure that you set
.Li rc_configured=YES
so that your changes will be enabled and a multi-user boot can
proceed.
Default values for the various programs can be found in
.Pa /etc/defaults/rc.conf ,
where some in-line documentation may be found.
More complete documentation can be found in
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
.Pp
When you have finished editing
.Pa /etc/rc.conf ,
type
.Ic exit
at the prompt to
leave the single-user shell and continue with the multi-user boot.
.Pp
Other values that may need to be set in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
for a networked environment are
.Ar hostname
and possibly
.Ar defaultroute .
You may also need to add an
.Ar ifconfig_int
for your
.Aq int
network interface,
.ie \n[mac68k] \{\
where your on-board, NuBus or PDS interface may be
.Li ae0 ,
.Li mc0
or
.Li sn0 .
For example:
.\}
.el \{\
.ie \n[macppc] \{\
where your on-board interfaces may be one of
.Li mc0 ,
.Li bm0 ,
.Li tlp0
or
.Li gem0 .
For example:
.\}
.el along the lines of
.\}
.Pp
.

.if \n[amd64]     .ds IFname wm0

.
.Dl ifconfig_\*[IFname]="inet 192.0.2.123 netmask 255.255.255.0"
.Pp
or, if you have
.Ar myname.my.dom
in
.Pa /etc/hosts :
.Pp
.Dl ifconfig_\*[IFname]="inet myname.my.dom netmask 255.255.255.0"
.Pp
To enable proper hostname resolution, you will also want to add an
.Pa /etc/resolv.conf
file or (if you are feeling a little more adventurous) run
.Xr named 8 .
See
.Xr resolv.conf 5
or
.Xr named 8
for more information.
.Pp
Instead of manually configuring networking,
DHCP can be used by setting
.Li dhcpcd=YES
in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf .
.if \n[shark] \{\
.It
Select the proper terminal devices
.Pp
You will have to edit the
.Pa /etc/ttys
file and change the console terminal type from vt100 to pc3.
.\}
.if \n[atari] \{\
.It
Select the proper terminal devices
.Pp
You will have to edit the
.Pa /etc/ttys
file.
If you don't have a Milan, you must disable the
.Pa ttyEx
devices.
For the Milan, you will have to disable the
.Pa ttyex
devices.
This is easy, just change 'on' to 'off' on the corresponding lines.
.\}
.if \n[cats] \{\
.Pp
For the
.Xr savecore 8
facility to work with the a.out and elf kernel images supplied with
\*M installations you will need to set
.Li savecore_flags="-z -N /netbsd"
.\}
.if \n[sparc]:\n[sparc64] \{\
.It
Select the proper terminal devices
.Pp
If you are using a serial console, you will have to edit the
.Pa /etc/ttys
file and change
.if \n[sparc] sun
.if \n[sparc64] sun-ss5
to the appropriate terminal type, such as vt220.
.\}
.It
Logging in
.Pp
After reboot, you can log in as
.Li root
at the login prompt.
If you didn't set a password in
.Ic sysinst ,
there
is no initial password.
You should create an account for yourself (see below) and protect it and the
.Dq root
account with good passwords.
By default, root login from the network is disabled (even via
.Xr ssh 1 ) .
One way to become root over the network is to log in as a different
user that belongs to group
.Dq wheel
(see
.Xr group 5 )
and use
.Xr su 1
to become root.
.It
Adding accounts
.Pp
Use the
.Xr useradd 8
command to add accounts to your system.
Do not
edit
.Pa /etc/passwd
directly! See
.Xr vipw 8
and
.Xr pwd_mkdb 8
if you want to edit the password database.
.if !\n[sun2] \{\
.It
The X Window System
.Pp
If you installed the X Window System, you may want to read the
chapter about X in the
.Lk https://www.NetBSD.org/docs/guide/en/chap-x.html "NetBSD Guide" :
.if \n[hp300] \{\
Also, you may want to read through the
.Nx*M
.Lk https://www.NetBSD.org/ports/hp300/faq.html#x11 "FAQ entry on X11" .
.\}
.if \n[mac68k] \{\
.(tag [Color_X]
.It [Color_X]
Some systems are capable of supporting a color X Server in either thousands
or millions of colors.
The \*M port does not support resolution switching at this time.
If your system is capable of running the color X Server it can be
installed at this point and the Booter options can be
modified to match the resolution depth.
.tag)
.\}
.\}
.It
Installing third party packages
.Pp
If you wish to install any of the software freely available for
.Ul
systems you are strongly advised to first check the
.Nx
package system, pkgsrc.
pkgsrc automatically handles any changes necessary to make the
software run on
.Nx .
This includes the retrieval and installation of any other
packages the software may depend upon.
.Pp
.(bullet
More information on the package system is available at
.Lk https://www.NetBSD.org/docs/software/packages.html
.It
A list of available packages suitable for browsing is at
.Lk https://cdn.NetBSD.org/pub/pkgsrc/current/pkgsrc/README.html
.It
Precompiled binaries can be found at
.Lk https://cdn.NetBSD.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/
usually in the
.Pa \*M/\*V/All
subdir.
If you installed
.Xr pkgin 1
in the
.Ic sysinst
post-installation configuration menu, you can use it to automatically install
binary packages over the network.
Assuming that
.Pa /usr/pkg/etc/pkgin/repositories.conf
is correctly configured, you can install them with the following commands:
.Pp
.Bd -unfilled
.Ic # pkgin install tcsh
.Ic # pkgin install bash
.Ic # pkgin install perl
.Ic # pkgin install apache
.Ic # pkgin install kde
.Ic # pkgin install firefox
\&...
.Ed
.(Note
Some mirror sites don't mirror the
.Pa /pub/pkgsrc
directory.
.Note)
.Pp
The above commands will install the Tenex-csh and Bourne Again shells,
the Perl programming language, Apache web server, KDE desktop
environment and the Firefox web browser
as well as all the packages they depend on.
.It
If you did not install it from the
.Ic sysinst
post-installation configuration menu, the
.Xr pkgsrc 7
framework for compiling packages can be obtained by
retrieving the file
.Lk https://cdn.NetBSD.org/pub/pkgsrc/stable/pkgsrc.tar.gz .
It is typically extracted into
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc
(though other locations work fine) with the commands:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "cd /usr"
.Dl # Ic "tar -zxpf pkgsrc.tar.gz"
.Pp
After extracting, see the
.Pa doc/pkgsrc.txt
file in the extraction directory (e.g.,
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc/doc/pkgsrc.txt )
for more information.
.bullet)
.It
Misc
.(bullet
Edit
.Pa /etc/mail/aliases
to forward root mail to the right place.
Don't forget to run
.Xr newaliases 1
afterwards.
.It
Edit
.Pa /etc/rc.local
to run any local daemons you use.
.It
Many of the
.Pa /etc
files are documented in section 5 of the manual; so just invoking
.Pp
.Dl # Ic man 5 Ar filename
.Pp
is likely to give you more information on these files.
