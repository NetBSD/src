Introduction
.Pp
To netboot a \*M, you must configure one or more servers to provide
information and files to your \*M (the
.Sq client ) .
If you are using
.Nx
(any architecture) on your netboot server(s), the information
provided here should be sufficient to configure everything.
Additionally, you may wish to look at the
.Xr diskless 8
manual page and the manual pages for each daemon you'll be configuring.
If the server(s) are another operating system, you should consult the
NetBSD Diskless HOW-TO, which will walk you through the steps necessary to
configure the netboot services on a variety of platforms:

process involves discovery, kernel and file system stages.

Briefly, the netboot
process involves discovery, bootstrap, kernel and file system stages.
In the first stage, the client discovers information
about where to find the bootstrap program.
Next, it downloads and executes the bootstrap program.
.ie \n[hppa] \{\
The server contains one large file (a LIF file system) with the bootloader
and the kernel.  The bootstrap program simply loads the kernel from the
LIF image.
.\}

The bootstrap program goes through another discovery phase to determine
where the kernel is located.
The bootstrap program tries to mount the NFS share containing the kernel.

Early \*M systems use HP's proprietary RMP (the

We will use
.Sq Li "CC:CC:CC:CC:CC:CC"
as the MAC address (ethernet hardware address) of your netboot client
machine.
You should have determined this address in an earlier stage.
In this example, we will use
.Sq Li 192.168.1.10
as the IP address of your client and
.Sq Li client.test.net
as its name.
We will assume you're providing all of your netboot services
on one machine called
.Sq Li server.test.net
with the client's files exported from the directory
.Pa /export/client/root .
You should, of course, replace all of these with the names, addresses,
and paths appropriate to your environment.
.Pp
You should set up each netboot stage in order (i.e., discovery,
bootstrap, kernel, and then file system) so that you can test them as you
proceed.
