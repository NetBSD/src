.To 2 Introduction
.Em Introduction
.Pp
Using
.Ic sysinst ,
installing
.Nx
is a relatively easy process.
Still, you should read this document and have it in hand when doing the
installation process.
This document tries to be a good guide to the installation, and as such,
covers many details for the sake of completeness.
Do not let this discourage you; the install program is not hard
to use.

.Em SCSI driver problems
.Pp
The SCSI driver used in the kernel on many older Macintosh systems is, by
default, the ncrscsi driver.
It contains a recognized but as yet unfixed bug that affects some
disk drive/controller combinations, usually Quantum disks.
Under heavy load these systems may hang or corrupt
the file system; or, you may experience frequent
.Em Segmentation fault
and
.Em Illegal instruction
errors that may or may not be consistently repeatable.
This latter condition is particularly prevalent on systems with
minimal RAM installed.
.Pp
If either of these problems occur on your system you are advised to use the
SBC variants of the Kernel and Installation Kernel.
However, be aware that this issue does not affect
e.g. Centris or Quadra systems.
.Pp
.It 
.Em The 68LC040 processor
.Pp
.Nx
has known but unresolved problems running on the 68LC040 processor, the
variant of the 68040 that does not contain the floating point unit (FPU).
The kernel is thus forced to emulate the missing operations in software.
Unfortunately the 68LC040 processor has a design problem that causes
the emulation to fail intermittently.
We hope to provide a solution for this issue in a future
.Nx
release.
.Pp
Software emulation of floating point operations is
not a problem on the 68020 and 68030 processors.

.It
.To 2 General
.Em General
.Pp
The following is a walk-through of the steps you will take while
getting
.Nx
installed on your hard disk.
.Ic sysinst
is a menu driven
installation system that allows for some freedom in doing the
installation.
Sometimes, questions will be asked and in many cases
the default answer will be displayed in brackets
.Pq Dq \&[\ ]
after the question.
If you wish to stop the installation, you may press
.Key CONTROL-C
at any time, but if you do, you'll have to begin the installation
process again from scratch by running the
.Pa /sysinst
program from the command prompt.
It is not necessary to reboot.

restore 32-bit addressing.
You should probably reboot after doing so.
If you have an older II-class system (including the II, IIx, IIcx,

Definition of the NetBSD disklabel.
.Pp
The Apple Disk Partition Map is used to create an in-core map of the
disk called the disklabel.
A minimum of two NetBSD partitions will be required,
one for root and one for swap.
Up to eight partitions may be used by NetBSD.
Up to 32 partitions may exist on the disk which
can be any combination of Mac OS HFS, Free, Scratch and
.Nx
partitions, although only the first eight which meet the needs of
.Nx
will be seen and mapped to the
.Nx
disklabel.
.Pp
Some partitions in the disklabel have a fixed purpose.
Partition 'a' is always the root partition, 'b' is the swap partition
and 'c' is the entire disk.
Partitions 'd' through 'h' are available for other use.
Traditionally, 'g' is the partition mounted on the /usr directory, but
this is historical practice, not a fixed value.
.It
Editing the
.Nx
Disklabel (and the underlying Apple Disk Partition Map).
.Pp
You will be presented with the current layout of the disk as seen by
.Nx ,
and given a change to change it.
(Even though
.Nx
can only use the first eight qualified partitions, all partitions
found on the disk will be displayed.)
The partitions found on the disk will be shown in the top section of
the display.
Each will be identified with the name assigned by
.Nx ,
the current size, offset, type, use and mount point.
The partition currently being modified will be highlighted in inverse video.
The bottom part of the display will list the operations which may be
performed on the selected (highlighted) partition.
The options are:
.(bullet
Select next partition
.Pp
This highlights the next partition in the upper display list and makes it
the current one selected for manipulation.
.It
Change selected partition
.Pp
This changes the type assigned to the partition.
A partition may be assigned for use as a
.Nx
Root, SWAP, Usr, or Root&Usr; it may be assigned for use as a Mac OS HFS
partition; a Scratch (for later reassignment); or a Free partition.
Free partitions which are physically adjacent to each other will be collapsed
into a single Free partition.
.It
Set mount point for partition
.Pp
This designates the
.Nx
file system mount point for the partition, and gets transferred into
the /etc/fstab definition so
.Nx
knows where to mount the file system on subsequent boots.
The option only applies to
.Nx
Root, Usr, Root&Usr or Mac OS HFS partitions, although currently HFS access
is not supported without optional software components.
A common set of predefined mount points (/usr, /home, /var, /tmp or None)
will be presented to you to assist you in defining the most commonly used,
but you may enter you own names if you choose.
Selecting "None" will clear the mount point name and keep the partition
from being defined in the resulting
.Pa /etc/fstab
file.
.It
Split selected partition
.Pp
This option divides the selected partition into two separate partitions
if there is space available in the Disk Partition Map.
You will be prompted for the size of the first segment and the remaining
portion will be allocated to the second segment.
The first segment will be designated as a Scratch type, and the second
will be designated as a Free type.
To clear a split, or remerge two adjacent partitions into a
single one, change both to be Free types.
.Ic sysinst
will merge them and update the display.
.Pp
This is the primary option used to partition the disk since it allows
you to sub-divide the selected partition into two partitions.
Changing the types associated with the resulting two parts, or splitting the
second part further sub-divides the original partition.
.It
Page Up, Page Down
.Pp
These entries allow you to scroll the upper display if more than
eight partitions currently exist on the disk.
.It
Fix selected partition
.Pp
This option reviews the partition's size and starting address and fixes
the values if they overlap any adjacent partition.
This is primarily a debugging option and shouldn't be necessary during a
normal installation.
However, some 3rd party disk formatters have been known to create
bogus entries in the Apple Disk Partition Map, and this option can aid
is repairing these entries.
.It
Exit
.Pp
This option completes the disk partitioning and returns you to the
previous installation menu.
At that point you will be given one last opportunity to bail out before
committing the changes to the Disk Partition Map recorded on the disk.
.bullet)
.Pp
.It
Recommended approach to partitioning
.Pp
The simplest method of approaching disk partitioning with
.Ic sysinst
is to convert everything that can be used for
.Nx
into a Free type partition.
This will allow
.Ic sysinst
to collapse and merge all the available space.
Then cycle through the Select, Split, Select, Change, and Set Mount Point
options for each of the
.Nx
partitions that are desired.
Since
.Nx*M
has a very specific
mount order for partitions during system boot, it is best to create your
.Nx
partitions in the following order:  Root, SWAP, Usr where the partitions
will be mounted in order on 'a', 'b', 'g', 'd', 'e', 'f', and 'h'.
.Pp
At least one Root or Root&Usr is required, and a SWAP partition is
highly desirable.
As a general rule you will need twice as much swap
space as you have RAM, more if you plan on running X, Web applications
or doing heavy development in a multi-user environment.
The Root partition, if it is separate from your Usr, usually requires about
24 MB.
.Pp
If multiple Root partitions are defined, the second is usually
mounted on /altusr by default.
.Nx*M
automatically mounts all
Root partitions after the first as Usr type partitions.
However, it is best to be very specific about mount points and partition
type and use.

files.
The floppies are expected to be in
.Tn MS-DOS
format.
You will be asked for a directory where the sets should be reassembled.
Then you will be prompted to insert the floppies containing the split sets.
This process will continue until all the sets have been loaded from floppy.

To finalize the installation of

certain parameters on the Cyclone firmware need to changed.
The reason is that the Cyclone firmware is unable to boot anything other
than an a.out format kernels.
.Pp
Kernels created on a
.Nx*M
\*V system are natively ELF and converted to a.out.
This conversion process loses the symbol information used for,
amongst other things, kernel memory grovelers such as vmstat.
The workaround to the problem is to provide both the native ELF kernel
(with all the symbol information) and the a.out kernel.
These are available as /netbsd and /netbsd.aout respectively.
As the a.out format kernel is not named in such a way that the
Cyclone firmware will automatically find it the following command
should be issued as the firmware prompt.
