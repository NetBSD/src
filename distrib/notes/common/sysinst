.Em Introduction
.Pp
Using
.Ic sysinst ,
installing
.Nx
is a relatively easy process. You
still should read this document and have it in hand when doing the
installation process. This document tries to be a good guideline
for the installation and as such covers many details to be completed.
Do not let this discourage you, the install program is not hard
to use.

.To 2 "Possible PCMCIA issues"
.Em Possible Tn PCMCIA Em issues
.Pp
Machines with
.Tn PCMCIA
slots may have problems during installation. With the improvements of
the
.Tn PCMCIA
code in this release, this will not happen very frequently.
If you do not have
.Tn PCMCIA
on your machine
.Tn ( PCMCIA
is only really used on laptop machines),
you can skip this section, and ignore the
.Dq Bq Tn PCMCIA
notes. If you do have
.Tn PCMCIA
in your machine, you can safely ignore this section and the
.Dq Bq Tn PCMCIA
the first time, as you are likely to not have problems. Should troubles
occur during floppy boot, they may be
.Tn PCMCIA
specific. You should then re-read this section and try again,
following the instructions in the
.Dq Bq Tn PCMCIA
notes.
.Pp
This section explains how to work around the installation problem.
.Pp
The kernel keeps careful track of what interrupts
and I/O ports are in use during autoconfiguration. It then allows
the
.Tn PCMCIA
devices to pick unused interrupts and I/O ports.
Unfortunately, the
.Tn Li INSTALL
kernel may not detect all devices in your system. This may
be because the
.Tn Li INSTALL
kernel only supports the minimum set of devices to install
.Nx
on your system, or it may be that
.Nx
does not have support for the device causing the conflict.
.Pp
For example, suppose your laptop has a
soundblaster device built in; the
.Tn Li INSTALL
kernel has no sound support. The
.Tn PCMCIA No code might allocate your soundblaster's
.Tn IRQ No and I/O ports to
.Tn PCMCIA
devices, causing them not to work, or to lock up the system. This is
especially bad if one of the devices in question is your ethernet
card.
.Pp
As of
.Nx 1.5 ,
the kernel attempts to probe for available interrupts that are
usable by the
.Tn PCIC
.Tn ( PCMCIA
interrupt controller). Assuming that this functions correctly, it
should alleviate interrupt conflicts; however, I/O port conflicts are
still possible.
.Pp
This problem will impact some, but not all, users of
.Tn PCMCIA .
If this problem is affecting you, watch the
.Dq Bq Tn PCMCIA
notes that will appear in this document.
.if r_i386 \{\
.Pp
It can be difficult to distinguish an interrupt conflict from
an I/O space conflict. There are no hard-and-fast rules, but
interrupt conflicts are more likely to lock up the machine,
and I/O space conflicts are more likely to result in misbehavior
(e.g. a network card that cannot send or receive packets).
.Pp
The kernel selects a free interrupt according to a mask of allowable
interrupts, stored in the kernel global variable
.Va pcic_isa_intr_alloc_mask .
This mask is a logical-or of power-of-2s of allowable interrupts:
.(disp
IRQ  Val     IRQ  Val     IRQ  Val      IRQ  Val
  0  0x0001    4  0x0010    8  0x0100    12  0x1000
  1  0x0002    5  0x0020    9  0x0200    13  0x2000
  2  0x0004    6  0x0040   10  0x0400    14  0x4000
  3  0x0008    7  0x0080   11  0x0800    15  0x8000
.disp)
.Pp
For example, 0x0a00 allows both IRQ 9 and IRQ 11. By default,
the
.Tn Li INSTALL
kernel permits all IRQs other than IRQs 5 and 7, so the corresponding
mask is 0xff5f. The
.Tn Li GENERIC
kernel, however, allows all IRQs. (The presumption here
is that IRQ 10 may be assigned to a device that the
.Tn Li GENERIC
kernel
supports, but that the
.Tn Li INSTALL
does not.) Because of support for interrupt probing, it is no
longer necessary to exclude IRQs 3 and 5 explicitly; if they are
in use, they should not be assigned to
.Tn PCMCIA .
.Pp
The kernel selects IO space by assigning cards IO space within a
predefined range.  The range is specified as a base and size,
specified by the kernel global variables
.Va pcic_isa_alloc_iobase
and
.Va pcic_isa_alloc_iosize .
For systems with 12-bit addressing (most systems), the kernel defaults to a
base of 0x400 and a size of 0xbff (a range of 0x400-0xfff).
For systems with 10-bit addressing, the kernel defaults to a
base of 0x300 and a size of 0xff (range of 0x300-0x3ff).
.Pp
Unfortunately, these ranges may conflict with some devices. In the
event of a conflict, try a base of 0x330 with a size of 0x0bf (range
of 0x330-0x3ff).
.Pp
In order to work around this at installation time, you may
boot the
.Tn Li INSTALL
kernel with
.Ic boot Fl d ,
in order to enter
.Xr ddb 4
(the in-kernel debugger), and then use the
.Ic write
command to alter the variable values:
.Pp
.Dl db\*> Ic "write pcic_isa_intr_alloc_mask 0x0a00"
.Dl "pcic_isa_intr_alloc_mask            0xff5f = 0xa00"
.Dl db\*> Ic "write pcic_isa_alloc_iobase 0x330"
.Dl "pcic_isa_alloc_iobase               0x400 = 0x330"
.Dl db\*> Ic "write pcic_isa_alloc_iosize 0x0bf"
.Dl "pcic_isa_alloc_iosize               0xbff = 0xbf"
.Dl db\*> Ic "continue"
.Pp
Note that, since some floppy images may not have symbol information in
the kernel, you may have to consult the matching
.Pa .symbols
file in the
.Pa binary/kernel
directory in the installation tree. Find the pcic_ symbols used above,
look at the hexadecimal value in the first column, and write, for
example (if
.Va pcic_isa_intr_alloc_mask
is equal to c0513e3c):
.Pp
.Dl db\*> Ic "write 0xc0513e3c 0x0a00"
.Pp

After installation, this value can be permanently written to the kernel image
directly with:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "cp /netbsd /netbsd.bak"
.Dl # Ic "gdb --write /netbsd"
.Dl (gdb) Ic "set pcic_isa_intr_alloc_mask=0x0a00"
.Dl (gdb) Ic "set pcic_isa_alloc_iobase=0x330"
.Dl (gdb) Ic "set pcic_isa_alloc_iosize=0x0bf"
.Dl (gdb) Ic "quit"
.Dl #
.Pp
or you could specify these value when configuring your kernel, e.g.:
.(disp
options PCIC_ISA_INTR_ALLOC_MASK=0x0a00
options PCIC_ISA_ALLOC_IOBASE=0x330
options PCIC_ISA_ALLOC_IOSIZE=0x0bf
.disp)
.Pp
If you can
get your
.Tn PCMCIA
card to work using this hack, you may also ignore the
.Bq Tn PCMCIA
notes later in this document.
.Pp
We hope to provide a more elegant solution to this problem in a future
.Nx
release.
