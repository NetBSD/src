.Ss2 Get to the ROM Monitor prompt
.
After the system performs its power-on self test, and while it tries to
boot an operating system, press the
.Key COMMAND-`
keys (the backquote is above 7 on the keypad on the right of the keyboard).
You should see a prompt like this:
.(disp
                        NeXT ROM Monitor 2.5 (v66)

CPU MC68040 25 MHz, memory 100 nS
Backplane slot #0
Ethernet address:  0:0:f:0:fb:90
Memory size 40 MB
NeXT\*>
.disp)
.Pp
Write down the ethernet address.
You will need this later to configure the netboot server for your
.Nx*M
system.
.
.Ss2 Change the configuration parameters to netboot
.
Press the
.Key p
key to modify the configuration parameters.
You will need to change the
.Li "boot command"
to
.Li "en()netbsd"
which is to boot from the
.Li "en()"
ethernet device the kernel named
.Li netbsd .
You should wite down what the original
.Li "boot command"
was in case you wish to boot
.Tn NEXTSTEP
in the future.
It will probably be
.Li "sd()" .
While modifying the parameters, you may wish to set the system to use
.Li "verbose test mode"
which will print detailed messages while it is attempting to load the
kernel, as opposed to the normal graphic of a network cable.
You should not set the
.Li "extended diagnostics"
as the system will try to boot a diagnostic kernel.
Here is an example configuration session:
.(disp
.No "NeXT\*>" Ic p
.No "boot command: sd()?" Ic "en()netbsd"
.No "DRAM tests:  yes?" Ic "yes"
.No "perform power-on system test:  yes?" Ic "yes"
.No "        sound out tests:  yes?" Ic "yes"
.No "        SCSI tests:  yes?" Ic "yes"
.No "        loop until keypress:  no?" Ic "no"
.No "        verbose test mode:  no?" Ic "yes"
.No "boot extended diagnostics:  no?" Ic "no"
.No "serial port A is alternate console:  no?" Ic "yes"
.No "allow any ROM command even if password protected:  no?" Ic "no"
.No "allow boot from any device even if password protected:  no?" Ic "no"
.No "allow optical drive #0 eject even if password protected:  yes?" Ic "yes"
.No "enable parity cehcking if parity memory is present:  no?" Ic "no"
.disp)
.Pp
Now, whenever you reset or power on your system, it will attempt to netboot.
From the ROM Monitor prompt, you can simply type
.Key b
to netboot.
You can also press the power key (above the arrows) to turn off the system.
