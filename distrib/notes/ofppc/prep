.Nx*M
can be installed on hard disks with the standard
.Tn MBR
partition layout or with the
.Tn AmigaOS/MorphOS
specific
.Tn RDB
partition layout.
.Pp
When choosing
.Tn RDB
partitions, for example because you want to run
.Tn MorphOS
on a
.Tn Pegasos II
in parallel with
.Nx ,
then you have to prepare your
.Nx
partitions using the
.Tn MorphOS
.Tn HDConfig
tool.
.Pp
You can skip the rest of this section when you want to use
.Tn MBR
partitioning.
.Pp
You will have to create an
.Tn RDB
partition for each
.Nx
partition,
.Nx*M
will use.
Change the partition parameters by selecting
.Em Edit Partition
and change the following settings:
.(enum
Set all reserved block to zero.
.It
Set the partition status to
.Em disabled
so it won't appear under
.Tn MorphOS .
.It
Select
.Em Custom
Filesystem and change the ID to
.Pa 0x4e425207
for the root partition, to
.Pa 0x4e425301
for the swap partition and to
.Pa 0x4e425507
for all the other user partitions you need.
