Installation of NetBSD/vax is now easier than ever!
For the latest news, problem reports, and discussion, join
the port-vax mainlist by mailing a line saying
.Dl subscribe port-vax
to
.Mt majordomo@netsbd.org .
Also, see
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org
for more information.
.Pp
If you encounter any problems, please report them via the mailing list or the
.Xr send-pr 1
program so that they can be fixed for the next release.

To install or upgrade NetBSD, you need to first boot the installation
program and then interact with the screen-menu program
.Ic sysinst .
The installation program actually consists of the NetBSD kernel plus
an in-memory file system of utility programs.
.Pp
The usual procedure is to write the installation system to the
install media, as described earlier.
.Pp
Booting from install media
.Pp
The built-in console monitor understands a bunch of commands, dependent
of which VAX you have. To just boot from a device, type 'B' at the '>>>'
prompt. Device naming in the console monitor differs a lot from the
Unix counterparts. A device looks like "ddcu", where dd is the device
type, c is the controller number and u is the device unit. Many console
monitors also support the 'SHOW DEV' command, which shows available
units to boot from.
.Pp
A summary of the most common boot devices and their name:
.D1 Ic "B DUA0 - first MSCP controller, unit 0.
.D1 Ic "B MUA0 - first TMSCP tape controller, unit 0.
.D1 Ic "B DKB0 - second SCSI bus, unit 0.
.D1 Ic "B XQA0 - first Q22 bus Ethernet controller.
.D1 Ic "B ESA0 - first LANCE Ethernet controller on VAXstations.
Other devices may be appropriate for your configuration.
.Pp
Then just proceed with the program sysinst. The install descriptions
for sysinst that follows can be easily adopted to vax.

.\" Sad that the sysinst install instructions are so i386-specific.
