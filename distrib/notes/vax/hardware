and LANCE chip where available.
.It Em Serial lines:

Some third-party controllers are also known to work, other do not.
.It Em Tapes:
TMSCP on Q22 bus (TK50/70), SCSI tapes on VAXstations.

The minimal configuration requires 2M of RAM and ~40MB of disk space,
but the installation requires at least 4MB RAM and you probably do
not want to run with anything less than that.
