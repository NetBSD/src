.Nx*M
\*V runs on Acorn systems with
.Tn ARM6
or later processors,
with or without FPU coprocessor. The minimal configuration is said to
require 8 MB of RAM and 50 MB of disk space, though we do not know of anyone
running with a system quite this minimal today. To install the entire
system requires much more disk space (the unpacked binary distribution,
without sources, requires at least 65 MB without counting space needed for
swap space, etc), and to run X or compile the system, more RAM is
recommended. (8 MB of RAM will actually allow you to run X and/or compile,
but it won't be speedy. Note that until you have around 16 MB of RAM,
getting more RAM is more important than getting a faster CPU.)
