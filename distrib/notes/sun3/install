Installing
.Nx
is a relatively complex process, but if you have
this document in hand it should not be too difficult.
.Pp
There are several ways to install
.Nx
onto your disk.
If your machine has a tape drive the easiest way is
.Sx "Installing from tape"
(details below).
If your machine is on a network with a suitable NFS server, then
.Sx "Installing from NFS"
is the next best method.
Otherwise, if you have another
.Tn Sun
machine running
.Tn SunOS
you can initialize the disk on that machine and then move the disk.
(Installing from
.Tn SunOS
is not recommended.)
.
.Ss2 Installing from tape
.
Create the
.Nx*M
\*V boot tape as described in the section
entitled
.Sx "Creating boot/install tapes"
and boot the tape.
At the PROM monitor prompt, use one of the commands:
.Pp
.Dl \*[Gt] Ns Ic "b st()"
.Dl \*[Gt] Ns Ic "b st(0,8,0)"
.Pp
The first example will use the tape on SCSI target 4, where the
second will use SCSI target 5.
The
.Li \*[Gt]
is the monitor prompt.
.Pp
After the tape loads, you should see many lines of configuration
messages, and then the following
.Sq "welcome"
screen:
.(disp
        Welcome to the NetBSD/\*M RAMDISK root!

This environment is designed to do only three things:
1:  Partition your disk (use the command:  edlabel /dev/rsd0c)
2:  Copy a miniroot image into the swap partition  (/dev/rsd0b)
3:  Reboot (using the swap partition, i.e. /dev/sd?b).

Note that the sun3 firmware cannot boot from a partition located
more than 1 GB from the beginning of the disk, so the swap partition
should be completely below the 1 GB boundary.

Copying the miniroot can be done several ways, allowing
the source of the miniroot image to be on any of these:
    boot tape,  NFS server, TFTP server, rsh server

The easiest is loading from tape, which is done as follows:
        mt -f /dev/nrst0 rewind
        mt -f /dev/nrst0 fsf 2
        dd if=/dev/nrst0 of=/dev/rsd0b bs=32k conv=sync
(For help with other methods, please see the install notes.)

To reboot using the swap partition, first use "halt",
then at the PROM monitor prompt use a command like:
        b sd(,,1) -s

To view this message again, type:  cat /.welcome
.disp)
.Pp
Copy the miniroot as described in the welcome message, and
reboot from that just installed miniroot.
See the section entitled
.Sx Booting the miniroot
for details.
.
.Ss2 Installing from NFS
.
Before you can install from NFS, you must have already configured
your NFS server to support your machine as a diskless client.
Instructions for configuring the server are found in the section
entitled
.Sx Getting the NetBSD System onto Useful Media
above.
.Pp
First, at the
.Tn Sun
PROM monitor prompt, enter a boot command
using the network interface as the boot device.
On desktop machines this is
.Em le ,
and
.Em ie
on the others.
Examples:
.Pp
.Dl \*[Gt] Ns Ic "b le() -s"
.Dl \*[Gt] Ns Ic "b ie() -s"
.Pp
After the boot program loads the RAMDISK kernel, you should
see the welcome screen as shown in the
.Sx Installing from tape
section above.
You must configure the network interface before you
can use any network resources.
For example the command:
.Pp
.Dl ssh\*[Gt] Ic "ifconfig le0 inet 192.233.20.198 up"
.Pp
will bring up the network interface with that address.
The next step is to copy the miniroot from your server.
This can be done using either NFS or remote shell.
(In the examples that follow, the server has IP address 192.233.20.195.)
You may then need to add a default route if the server is on
a different subnet:
.Pp
.Dl ssh\*[Gt] Ic "route add default 192.233.20.255 1"
.Pp
You can look at the route table using:
.Pp
.Dl ssh\*[Gt] Ic "route show"
.Pp
Now mount the NFS file system containing the miniroot image:
.Pp
.Dl ssh\*[Gt] Ic "mount -r 192.233.20.195:/server/path /mnt"
.Pp
The procedure is simpler if you have space for an expanded
(not compressed) copy of the miniroot image.
In that case:
.Pp
.Dl ssh\*[Gt] Ic "dd if=/mnt/miniroot.fs of=/dev/rsd0b bs=8k"
.Pp
Otherwise, you will need to use
.Ic zcat
to expand the miniroot image while copying.
This is tricky because the
.Ic ssh
program
(small shell) does not handle
.Xr sh 1
pipeline syntax.
Instead, you first run the reader in the background with its input set
to
.Pa /dev/pipe
and then run the other program in the foreground with its output to
.Pa /dev/pipe .
The result looks like this:
.Pp
.Dl ssh\*[Gt] Ic "run -bg dd if=/dev/pipe of=/dev/rsd0b obs=8k"
.Dl ssh\*[Gt] Ic "run -o /dev/pipe zcat /mnt/install/miniroot.fs.gz"
.Pp
To load the miniroot using rsh to the server, you would use a
pair of commands similar to the above.
Here is another example:
.Pp
.Dl ssh\*[Gt] Ic "run -b dd if=/dev/pipe of=/dev/rsd0b obs=8k"
.Dl ssh\*[Gt] Ic "run -o /dev/pipe rsh 192.233.20.195 zcat miniroot.fs.gz"
.
.Ss2 Installing from SunOS
.
To install
.Nx*M
onto a machine already running
.Tn SunOS ,
you
will need the miniroot image (miniroot.fs.gz) and some means to
decompress it.
.Pp
First, boot
.Tn SunOS
and place the miniroot file onto the hard drive.
If you do not have
.Ic gzip
for
.Tn SunOS ,
you will need to decompress
the image elsewhere before you can use it.
.Pp
Next, bring
.Tn SunOS
down to single user mode to insure that nothing
will be using the swap space on your drive.
To be extra safe, reboot the machine into single-user mode
rather than using the
.Ic shutdown
command.
.Pp
Now copy the miniroot image onto your swap device (here
.Pa /dev/rsd0b )
with the command
.Pp
.Dl Ic "gzip -dc miniroot.fs.gz | dd of=/dev/rsd0b obs=32k"
.Pp
or if you have already decompressed the miniroot
.Pp
.Dl Ic "dd if=miniroot.fs of=/dev/rsd0b obs=32k"
.Pp
Finally, reboot the machine and instruct the ROM to boot from
the swap device as described in the next section.
.
.Ss2 Booting the Miniroot
.
If the miniroot was installed on partition
.Sq Li b
of the disk with
SCSI target ID=0 then the PROM boot command would be:
.Pp
.Dl \*[Gt] Ns Ic "b sd(0,0,1) -s"
.Pp
With SCSI target ID=2, the PROM is:
.Pp
.Dl \*[Gt] Ns Ic "b sd(0,10,1) -s"
.Pp
The numbers in parentheses above are:
.(enum -compact -offset indent
controller (usually zero)
.It
unit number (SCSI-ID * 8, in hexadecimal)
.It
partition number
.enum)
.
.Ss2 Miniroot install program
.
The miniroot's install program is very simple to use.
It will guide you through the entire process, and is well automated.
Additional improvements are planned for future releases.
.Pp
The miniroot's install program will:
.(bullet -offset indent
Allow you to place disklabels on additional disks.
The disk we are installing on should already have
been partitioned using the RAMDISK kernel.
.It
Create file systems on target partitions.
.It
Allow you to set up your system's network configuration.
Remember to specify host names without the domain name
appended to the end.
For example use
.Li foo
instead of
.Li foo.bar.org .
If, during the process of configuring
the network interfaces, you make a mistake, you will
be able to re-configure that interface by simply selecting
it for configuration again.
.It
Mount target file systems.
You will be given the opportunity to manually edit the resulting
.Pa /etc/fstab .
.It
Extract binary sets from the media of your choice.
.It
Copy configuration information gathered during the
installation process to your root file system
.Pq Pa / .
.It
Make device nodes in your root file system under
.Pa /dev .
.It
Copy a new kernel onto your root partition
.Pq Pa / .
.It
Install a new boot block.
.It
Check your file systems for integrity.
.bullet)
.Pp
First-time installation on a system through a method other than the
installation program is possible, but strongly discouraged.
