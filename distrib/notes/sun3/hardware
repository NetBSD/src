NetBSD/sun3 _VER runs on most Sun3 machines, including:
		3/50, 3/60, 3/110
		3/75, 3/150, 3/160
		3/260, 3/280, 3/E

NetBSD/sun3 _VER does not run on the Sun3/80 (sun3x class)
but that is presently handled as a separate distribution.
Use NetBSD/sun3x for Sun3/80 and Sun3/470 support.

The minimal configuration requires 4M of RAM and about 80MB of disk
space.  To install the entire system requires much more disk space
(approx. 100MB additional space is necessary for full sources).
To run X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  Good
performance requires 8MB of RAM, or 16 MB when running the
X Window System.

Here is a table of recommended HD partition sizes for a full install:
	partition:	advise,	with X,	needed,	with X
	root (/)	20M	20M	15M	15M
	user (/usr)	95M	125M	75M 	105M
	swap		----- 2M for every M ram -----
	local (/usr/local)	up to you

As you may note the recommended size of /usr is 20M greater than
needed. This is to leave room for a kernel source and compile tree as
you will probably want to compile your own kernel. (GENERIC is large
and bulky to accommodate all people).

Note that the sun3 installation procedure uses a `miniroot' image
which is placed into the swap area of the disk.  The swap partition
must be at least as large as the miniroot image (8MB).

The following Sun3 hardware is supported:

	Serial ports (RS232):
		built-in ttya, ttyb

	Video adapters:
		bwtwo, cgtwo, cgfour

	Network interfaces:
		On-board Lance Ethernet
		On-board or VME Intel Ethernet
		Sun3/E SCSI/Ethernet board

	SCSI:  (Most SCSI disks, tapes, CD-ROMs, etc.)
		On-board "si" (SCSI-3)
		VME "si" (SCSI-3) board
		Sun3/E SCSI/Ethernet board

	SMD Disks:  (the big, heavy ones 8^)
		Xylogics 450/451
		Xylogics 753/7053

	Input devices:
		Sun keyboard and mouse

	Miscellaneous:
		Battery-backed real-time clock.

If it's not on this list, there is no support for it in this release.
