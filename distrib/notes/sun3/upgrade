It is possible to easily upgrade your existing NetBSD/sun3 system
using the upgrade program in the miniroot. If you wish to upgrade
your system by this method, simply select the `upgrade' option once
the miniroot has booted. The upgrade program with then guide you
through the procedure. The upgrade program will:
.	Bl -bullet -offset indent
.	It
Enable the network based on your system's current network configuration.
.	It
Mount your existing filesystems.
.	It
Extract binary sets from the media of your choice.
.	It
Make new device nodes in your root filesystem.
.	It
Copy a new kernel onto your root partition.
.	(Note
the existing kernel
.	Em will not
be backed up; doing
so would be pointless, since older kernels may not be
capable of running
.	Nx \*V
executables.
.	Note)
.	It
Install a new boot block.
.	It
Check your filesystems for integrity.
.	El
.	Pp
Using the miniroot's upgrade program is the preferred method
of upgrading your system.
.\}
.Pp
However, it is possible to upgrade your system
manually. To do this, follow the following procedure:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
Place
.Em at least
the `base' binary set in a filesystem
accessible to the target machine. A local filesystem
is preferred, since the NFS subsystem in the
.Nx \*V
kernel may be incompatible with your old binaries.
.It
Back up your pre-existing kernel and copy the \*V
kernel into your root partition.
.It
Reboot with the \*V kernel into single-user mode.
(Otherwise you can not install the boot block.)
.It
Check all filesystems:
.D1 Ic /sbin/fsck -pf
.It
Mount all local filesystems:
.D1 Ic /sbin/mount -a -t nonfs
.It
If you keep /usr or /usr/share on an NFS server, you
will want to mount those filesystems as well. To do
this, you will need to enable the network:
.D1 Ic sh /etc/netstart
.It
Run the update(8) daemon, to ensure that new programs
are actually stored on disk.
.D1 Ic update
.It
Make sure you are in the root filesystem and extract
the `base' binary set:
.D1 Ic cd /
.D1 Ic tar --unlink -zxvpf Ar /path/to/base.tar.gz
.(Note
The
.Cm --unlink
option is
.Em very No important!
.Note)
.It
Install a new boot block:
(assuming root is on /dev/rsd0a)
.D1 Ic "cd /usr/mdec
.D1 Ic "cp -p \&./ufsboot /mnt/ufsboot
.D1 Ic "sync ; sleep 1 ; sync
.D1 Ic "\&./installboot -v /ufsboot bootxx /dev/rsd0a
.It
Sync the filesystems:
.D1 Ic sync
.It
At this point you may extract any other binary sets
you may have placed on local filesystems, or you may
wish to extract additional sets at a later time.
To extract these sets, use the following commands:
.D1 Ic cd /
.D1 Ic tar --unlink -zxvpf Ar "path to set
.El
.(Note
.No You Em should not
extract the
.Sy etc
set if upgrading. Instead, you should extract that set into another
area and carefully merge the changes by hand.
