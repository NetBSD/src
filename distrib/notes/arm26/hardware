all R-series workstations, the BBC A3000,
the A5000, A4, A3010, A3020 and A4000.

uses the machine's ROM OS to boot, and hence depends slightly on it.
It's been tested with RISC OS 3.10 and RISC OS 3.11, and should work
with other versions of RISC OS as well.
It hasn't been tested with Arthur at all.
