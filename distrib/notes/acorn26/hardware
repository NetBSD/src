\*V should support all common Acorn machines fitted with
ARM2, ARM3 and ARM250 CPUs.  This includes all Archimedes systems
(except for the A500 and A680 prototypes),
all R-series workstations, the BBC A3000,
the A5000, A4, A3010, A3020 and A4000.

at least 8 MB of RAM.
4 MB systems should work, but tend to run out of memory too easily to be
of any use.

uses the machine's ROM OS to boot, and hence depends slightly on it.
It's been tested with RISC OS 3.10 and RISC OS 3.11, and should work
with other versions of RISC OS as well.
It hasn't been tested with Arthur at all.
