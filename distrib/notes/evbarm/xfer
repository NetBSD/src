Generally, NetBSD is installed on ARM devices by writing a live image
(armv7.img, or arm64.img for 64-bit devices)
to a SD card or USB device.
For ARMv6 Raspberry Pi 1s, this image is rpi.img.gz.
The storage device should be at least 2GB.
.Pp
If you're on Windows rather than a Unix variant, you can use
.Lk https://www.netbsd.org/~martin/rawrite32/index.html rawrite32
instead of
.Xr dd 1
to write images, and
.Lk https://www.7-zip.org/ 7-Zip
to decompress .gz files.
.Pp
ARM devices generally also ship with a vendor-specific U-Boot
bootloader, which may be replaced with a board-specific "mainline"
U-Boot image from pkgsrc for an optimal NetBSD experience.
The images available from
.Lk http://www.armbsd.org/arm/ "armbsd.org"
come pre-prepared with a board-specific U-Boot image if one is
available, and otherwise a generic image can be used.
