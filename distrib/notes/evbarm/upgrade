The easiest way to upgrade to
.Nx
\*M
\*V
is by using the sysutils/sysupgrade package from pkgsrc.
.Pp
First, edit
.Pa /usr/pkg/etc/sysupgrade.conf .
Make sure RELEASEDIR and ARCHIVE_EXTENSION are correct:
.Bd -literal
# Replace evbarm-aarch64 with evbarm-earmv7hf on a 32-bit system, evbarm-earmv6hf on the original RPI
RELEASEDIR="https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-\*V/evbarm-aarch64/"
ARCHIVE_EXTENSION=tar.xz
.Ed
.Pp
Make sure
.Pa /boot
is mounted, and copy the new board-specific
.Pa *.dts
device tree file into place.
Note that the device tree files are sorted into SoC-type subdirectories in
.Pa /boot/dtb ,
e.g. allwinner, amlogic, broadcom, freescale, nvidia, rockchip.
.Pp
For example, for the Allwinner-based PINE A64 LTS:
.Bd -literal
$ ftp https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-\*V/evbarm-aarch64/binary/kernel/sun50i-a64-pine64-lts.dtb.gz
$ gunzip sun50i-a64-pine64-lts.dtb.gz
# cp sun50i-a64-pine64-lts.dtb /boot/dtb/allwinner/
.Ed
Also copy
.Pa bootaa64.efi
if applicable:
.Bd -literal
$ ftp https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-\*V/evbarm-aarch64/installation/misc/bootaa64.efi
# cp bootaa64.efi /boot/EFI/BOOT/bootaa64.efi
.Ed
.Pp
Finally:
.Bd -literal
# sysupgrade fetch
# sysupgrade kernel
# sysupgrade modules
# reboot
# sysupgrade sets
# sysupgrade etcupdate
# sysupgrade postinstall
# reboot
.Ed
.Pp
This is the most careful possible path with sysupgrade that makes sure
the kernel and userland are always fully compatible, by making sure the
kernel and boot files are newer than the userland.
It is also possible to:
.Bd -literal
# sysupgrade auto
# reboot
.Ed
