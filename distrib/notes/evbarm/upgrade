.Pp
The easiest way to upgrade to
.Nx
\*M
\*V
is by using the sysutils/sysupgrade package from pkgsrc.
.Pp
First, edit
.Pa /usr/pkg/etc/sysupgrade.conf .
Make sure RELEASEDIR and KERNEL are correct:
.Bd -literal
RELEASEDIR="https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-\*V/evbarm-aarch64/"
.Ed
or
.Bd -literal
RELEASEDIR="https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-\*V/evbarm-earmv7hf/"
.Ed
or
.Bd -literal
RELEASEDIR="https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-\*V/evbarm-earmv6hf/"
.Ed
.Pp
Make sure
.Pa /boot
is mounted, and copy the new board-specific
.Pa *.dts
file into place, and
.Pa bootaa64.efi
if applicable.
.Pp
Finally:
.Bd -literal
# sysupgrade fetch
# sysupgrade kernel netbsd-GENERIC (or netbsd-GENERIC64)
# sysupgrade modules
# reboot
# sysupgrade sets
# reboot
# sysupgrade postinstall
.Ed
.Pp
This is the most careful possible path.
It is also possible to:
.Bd -literal
# sysupgrade auto
# reboot
.Ed
