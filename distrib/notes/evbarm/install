.Ss2 Installation for the Intel IQ80310
The following steps describe how to set up an NFS root environment
for the IQ80310 and how to boot the IQ80310.
.Pp
.(enum
Place the kernel into the TFTP server's download area.
.Pp
RedBoot only loads S-Records, so select a kernel with the
.Dq .srec
filename suffix.
In this example, we will boot the kernel
hard-wired to use the on-board Ethernet as the root device.
.Pp
.Dl server# Ic cp netbsd-fxp0.srec /tftpboot/netbsd-iq80310-fxp0
.It
Unpack the distribution sets into the target's root directory.
.Pp
.Dl server# Ic cd /export/client/iq80310
.Dl server# Ic gzcat .../base.tgz | tar xvpf -
.Dl server# Ic gzcat .../etc.tgz | tar xvpf -
.Dl [ repeat for all sets you wish to unpack ]
.It
Load the kernel from the TFTP server.
.Pp

Entry point: 0xa0200000, address range: 0xa0200000-0xa035e07c
RedBoot\*>
.Ed
.It
Start the kernel running.
The kernel will display boot message,
probe for devices, and mount the root file system.
If you used a kernel hard-wired to use the on-board Ethernet, it will attempt
to mount the root file system automatically.
Otherwise, it will prompt for the root device to use.
.Pp
Since the system's run-time environment has not yet been configured,
the system should boot into single-user mode.
