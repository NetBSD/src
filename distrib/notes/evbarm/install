.Ss2 Installation for ARMv7 and AArch64 devices with U-Boot
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact
.It
Download or build armv7.img.gz (32-bit) or arm64.img.gz (64-bit).
.It
Decompress the .gz image, using
.Xr gunzip 1
on Unix.
.It
Write the image to disk:
.Bd -literal
# dd if=armv7.img of=/dev/rld0d bs=1m conv=sync
.Ed
.It
If you are using Microsoft Windows, you can use
.Lk https://www.netbsd.org/~martin/rawrite32/ "rawrite32"
to write SD card images, which can handle decompression too.
.It
To replace the vendor U-Boot bootloader with a "mainline" U-Boot,
obtain a board-specific image. Bootloaders are provided by the
.Pa sysutils/u-boot-*
packages in
.Lk https://www.pkgsrc.org/ "pkgsrc" .
.Pp
If you're using pkgsrc on an UNIX-like operating system that isn't NetBSD,
you must bootstrap first (see the 
.Pa README
file in the root directory of pkgsrc).
.Pp
You can also extract the U-Boot image from u-boot-*.tgz archive in an
existing
.Lk https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/aarch64/9.0/All/ "NetBSD binary package set".
.Pp
Install the board-specific U-Boot to the SD card,
e.g. for Allwiner devices (PINE H64 in this case):
.Bd -literal
# dd if=/usr/pkg/share/u-boot/pine-h64/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin of=/dev/rld0d bs=1k seek=8 conv=sync
.Ed
.Pp
Or a Rockchip device (e.g. RockPro64):
.Bd -literal
# dd if=/usr/pkg/share/u-boot/rockpro64/rksd_loader.img of=/dev/rld0d seek=64 conv=sync
.Ed
.El
.Pp
If you do not want to prepare a SD card image manually, NetBSD developer
Jared McNeill provides pre-prepared images on his website
.Lk http://www.armbsd.org/arm/ "armbsd.org" .
.Ss2 Installing NetBSD/evbarm to a SATA hard disk
Some ARM boards offer a SATA interface, and you might want to install NetBSD
to a hard disk after you've got it running from an SD card.
You can do this using 
.Xr sysinst 8
from within NetBSD.
.Pp
There are instructions for using
.Lk https://wiki.netbsd.org/ports/evbarm/install_using_sysinst/ "sysinst on ARM"
on the NetBSD wiki.
The main difference from installing on other ports is that a FAT32
partition is required for /boot.
