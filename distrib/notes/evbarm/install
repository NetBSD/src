.Ss2 Installation for the Technologic Systems TS-7200
The following steps describe how to set up a CompactFlash card for
the TS-7200.  The TS-7200 can use the interactive
installation program
.Ic sysinst 
to perform an internet installation from ftp.netbsd.org on the CompactFlash.  
.Pp
.(enum
Place the netbsd-TS7200_INSTALL.bin kernel into the TFTP server's download
area.  It must be decompressed from the gzipped image in the release directory
evbarm/installation/instkernel/netbsd-TS7200_INSTALL.srec.gz
.Pp
.Dl server# Ic gunzip netbsd-TS7200_INSTALL.srec.gz
.Dl server# Ic cp netbsd-TS7200_INSTALL.srec /tftpboot/netbsd-TS7200_INSTALL
.It
Load the kernel from the TFTP server.
.Pp

RedBoot\*[Gt] load netbsd-TS7200_INSTALL
.Ed
.It
Start the kernel running.
.Pp
.Bd -literal
RedBoot\*[Gt] go
.Ed
.Pp
The kernel will display boot messages, probe for devices, and invoke the
interactive sysinst installation tool.  Once sysinst has completed installation, the
system will reboot back into RedBoot.  If the preparation instructions above have
been followed, the post-installation NetBSD kernel will be in the FIS ready to be 
jumped into.  You can have RedBoot automatically start NetBSD by putting the
command
.Ic go 0x60660000
into the RedBoot bootscript using the
.Ic fconfig
command.

.Ss2 Installation for the Intel IQ80310
The following steps describe how to set up an NFS root environment
for the IQ80310 and how to boot the IQ80310.
.Pp
.(enum
Place the kernel into the TFTP server's download area.
.Pp
RedBoot only loads S-Records, so select a kernel with the
.Dq .srec
filename suffix.
In this example, we will boot the kernel
hard-wired to use the on-board Ethernet as the root device.
.Pp
.Dl server# Ic cp netbsd-fxp0.srec /tftpboot/netbsd-iq80310-fxp0
.It
Unpack the distribution sets into the target's root directory.
.Pp
.Dl server# Ic cd /export/client/iq80310
.Dl server# Ic gzcat .../base.\*[setsuffix] | tar xvpf -
.Dl server# Ic gzcat .../etc.\*[setsuffix] | tar xvpf -
.Dl [ repeat for all sets you wish to unpack ]
.It
Load the kernel from the TFTP server.

Entry point: 0xa0200000, address range: 0xa0200000-0xa035e07c
RedBoot\*[Gt]
.Ed
.It
Start the kernel running.
The kernel will display boot message,
probe for devices, and mount the root file system.
If you used a kernel hard-wired to use the on-board Ethernet, it will attempt
to mount the root file system automatically.
Otherwise, it will prompt for the root device to use.
.Pp
Since the system's run-time environment has not yet been configured,
the system should boot into single-user mode.
