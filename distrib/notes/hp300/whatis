This is the eigth major release of
.Nx
for the HP 9000/300 and 9000/400 series of computers.
.Pp
This release now has a working RAMDISK-based installer which is much 
easier to use than the old miniroot-based installer.
.Pp
This release now uses the MI
.Xr scsi 4
driver, thus supporting a wide variety of SCSI devices that would 
work poorly (or not at all) using the old \*M-specific SCSI driver.
.Pp
This release also now uses the MI
.Xr com 4
driver for DCA and APCI serial devices, covering all built-in serial ports 
and some DIO serial interfaces.
