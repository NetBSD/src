The hp300-specific portion of the NetBSD _VER release is found in the
"hp300" subdirectory of the distribution.  That subdirectory is laid
out as follows:

.../NetBSD-_VER/hp300/
	SOURCE_DATE			A file containing the date, in UTC,
					of the source code from which the
					release or snapshot was built, in the
					default format produced by the command:
					`date -u`.

	INSTALL				Installation notes; this file.

	binary/
		kernel/			Suitably named, gzipped hp300 kernels;
					see below.

		security/		Security-related hp300 binaries;
					see below.

		sets/			hp300 binary distribution sets;
					see below.

	installation/
		miniroot/		hp300 miniroot images; see below.

		misc/			Miscellaneous hp300 installation
					helper utilities; see installation
					section below.

The NetBSD/hp300 binary distribution sets contain the binaries which
comprise the NetBSD _VER release for the hp300.  There are eight binary
distribution sets, and the "security" distribution set.  The binary
distribution sets can be found in the "hp300/binary/sets" subdirectory of
the NetBSD _VER distribution tree, and are as follows:

	base	The NetBSD/hp300 _VER base binary distribution.
		You MUST install this distribution set.  It contains the
		base NetBSD utilities that are necessary for the
		system to run and be minimally functional.  It
		includes shared library support, and excludes
		everything described below.
		[ 9.2M gzipped, 26.4M uncompressed ]

	comp	The NetBSD/hp300 Compiler tools.  All of the tools
		relating to C and C++.  This set includes the system
		include files (/usr/include), the linker, the compiler
		tool chain, and the various system libraries (except
		the shared libraries, which are included as part of the
		base set).  This set also includes the manual pages for
		all of the utilities it contains, as well as the system
		call and library manual pages.
		[ 6.8M gzipped, 23.9M uncompressed ]

	etc	This distribution set contains the system
		configuration files that reside in /etc and in several other
		places. This set MUST be installed if you are installing the
		system from scratch, but should NOT be used if you are
		upgrading.  (If you are upgrading, it's recommended that
		you get a copy of this set and CAREFULLY upgrade your
		configuration files by hand.)
		[ 55K gzipped, 337K uncompressed ]

	games	This set includes the games and their manual pages.
		[ 2.9M gzipped, 7.5M uncompressed ]

	kern	This set includes a NetBSD/hp300 _VER GENERIC kernel,
		named "/netbsd". You MUST install this distribution set.
		[ 547K gzipped, 1.2M uncompressed ]

	man	This set includes all of the manual pages for the
		binaries and other software contained in the base set.
		Note that it does not include any of the manual pages
		that are included in the other sets.
		[ 2.5M gzipped, 10.4M uncompressed ]

	misc	This set includes the system dictionaries (which
		are rather large), the typesettable document set, and
		man pages for other architectures which happen to be
		installed from the source tree by default.
		[ 2.2M gzipped, 8.4M uncompressed ]

	text	This set includes NetBSD's text processing tools,
		including groff, all related programs, and their
		manual pages.
		[ 1.0M gzipped, 3.4M uncompressed ]

The hp300 security distribution set is named "secr" and can be found
in the "hp300/binary/security" subdirectory of the NetBSD _VER distribution
tree.  It contains executables which are built in the "src/domestic" portion
if the NetBSD source tree.  It can only be found on those sites which carry
the complete NetBSD distribution and that can legally obtain it.  (Remember,
because of United States law, it may not be legal to distribute this set to
locations outside of the United States and Canada.)
[ 776K gzipped, 263K uncompressed ]

Since NetBSD 1.3, binary sets for the X Window system are also
distributed with each NetBSD release. The binaries are based on
X11R6.3. Unfortunatly there is no R6.3 Xserver for NetBSD/hp300 yet,
so we can only distribute the X clients this time.
You can not yet install them using the new automated install system.
However, they are gzipped tarfiles, just like the other sets, so you
can always simply extract them once you have your NetBSD system installed
and running. The sets are:

	xbase		The basic files needed for a complete X
			client environment. This does not include
			the X servers.
			[ 2.5M gzipped, 7.6M uncompressed ]

	xcomp		The extra libraries and include files needed
			to compile X source code.
			[ 1.7M gzipped, 7.1M uncompressed ]

	xcontrib	Programs that were contributed to X.
			[ 183k gzipped, 686k uncompressed ]

	xfont		Fonts needed by X.
			[ 5.9M gzipped, 7.3M uncompressed ]

The hp300 binary distribution sets are distributed as gzipped tar files
named with the extension ".tgz", e.g. "base.tgz".
Each hp300 binary distribution set also has its own checksum files, just
as the source distribution sets do.

The instructions given for extracting the source sets work equally
well for the binary sets, but it is worth noting that if you use that
method, the files are extracted "below" the current directory.  That
is, if you want to extract the binaries "into" your system, i.e.
replace the system binaries with them, you have to run the "tar xfp"
from /.

The following are included in the `hp300/installation' directory:

	miniroot/
		miniroot.fs.gz		A copy of the miniroot filesystem.

	misc/
		HP-IB.geometry		A file containing geometry for some
					HB-IB disk drives.

		SYS_INST.gz		A gzipped copy of the SYS_INST
					miniroot installation program.

		SYS_UBOOT.gz		A gzipped copy of the universal boot
					block. Supports Network, tape and
					disk booting. This is useful if you
					are installing a diskless NetBSD/hp300
					system.

		rbootd.tgz		Source code for the rbootd program
					included with NetBSD. It requires that
					the server has a Berkeley Packet
					Filter (bpf).  You will need to
					compile this version of rbootd if
					server system does not have this
					utility already.

The following are included in the `hp300/binary/kernel'directory:

	netbsd.gdb.gz		A gzipped GENERIC kernel with debugging
				symbols.

	netbsd.gz		A gzipped GENERIC kernel.


Note:	Each directory in the hp300 binary distribution also has its
-----	own checksum files, just as the source distribution does:

	All BSDSUM files are historic BSD checksums for the various files
	in that directory, in the format produced by the command:
	cksum -o 1 <file>.

	All CKSUM files are POSIX checksums for the various files in that
	directory, in the format produced by the command: cksum <file>.

	All MD5 files are MD5 digests for the various files in that
	directory, in the format produced by the command: cksum -m <file>.

	All SYSVSUM files are historic AT&T System V UNIX checksums for
	the various files in that directory, in the format produced by
	the command: cksum -o 2 <file>.

	The MD5 digest is the safest checksum, followed by the POSIX
	checksum. The other two checksums are provided only to ensure
	that the widest possible range of system can check the integrity
	of the release files.
