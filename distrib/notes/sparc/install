Installing
.Nx
is a relatively complex process, but if you have
this document in hand it shouldn't be too much trouble.
.Pp
There are several ways to install
.Nx
onto your system.
The easiest way is to use the
.Pa miniroot.fs
image copied to your local disk's swap partition or a scratch drive.
If your Sparc is hooked up in a network, you may configure another
.Ul
machine as a netboot server for your Sparc.
.Pp
For more information on the commands and variables available in
the OpenBoot PROM (present in all sun4c and sun4m machines), go to
.Lk http://docs.sun.com
and search for
.Dq openboot reference
(without quotes).
.
.Ss2 Installing NetBSD by placing a bootable file system on a partitioned hard drive
.
.Pa installation/miniroot/miniroot.fs.gz
is a compressed, self-contained
.Nx
file system holding all utilities necessary to install
.Nx
onto a disk attached to your system.
It is distributed as a compressed plain
file you will transfer to a raw disk partition.
You will then boot this installer using the appropriate PROM command.
The simplest case is where you place the
.Pa miniroot.fs
file system on the swap partition of your disk.
Alternatively, you can place
it on any other unused partition on any disk (such as a Zip disk).
Be forewarned that you will not be able to install
.Nx
onto the partition that contains the
.Pa miniroot.fs
as this partition is needed during the install process.
.Pp
Loading the file system onto a raw partition is straightforward.
First, download
.Pa miniroot.fs
to your system.
Next, reboot in single-user mode (i.e.
.Ic "boot -s" )
to ensure that your system will not be swapping.
Finally, place the
.Pa miniroot.fs
on your partition of choice.
On
.Nx
or SunOS the commands are:
.Pp
.(disp
.No # Ic "gunzip miniroot.fs.gz"
.No # Ic "dd if=miniroot.fs of=/dev/rsd0b bs=4k"
.disp)
.Pp
Here,
.Li /dev/rsd0b
is assumed to be your swap partition.
If you decide to place
.Pa miniroot.fs
on a non-swap partition, it will overwrite all of the contents of that
partition, but you will not need to reboot into single-user mode to write it.
.Pp
After transferring the file system to disk, bring the system down by:
.Pp
.(disp
.No # Ic halt
.disp)
.Pp
Then boot the installer by typing the appropriate
command at the PROM prompt (this example is for the swap partition):
.Pp
.(tag OpenBoot\ PROM\ 2 -offset indent -compact
.It sunmon
.(disp
.No \*[Gt] Ic "b sd(,,1)netbsd -s"
.disp)
.It OpenBoot PROM 1
.(disp
.No ok Ic "boot sd(,,1)netbsd -s"
.disp)
.It OpenBoot PROM 2
.(disp
.No ok Ic "boot disk:b netbsd -s"
.disp)
.tag)
.Pp
The monitor boot command will load the
.Nx
kernel contained in the
file system image.
After the initial probe messages you'll be
asked to start the install or upgrade procedure.
Proceed to the section
.Sx Running the installation scripts.
below.
.
.Ss2 Installing NetBSD by using a bootable CD-ROM
.
If you wish to burn a CD-R containing a bootable NetBSD installation,
then you can either burn the prepared disk image in
.Pa images/NetBSD-\*V-sparc.iso
or create your own.
If you wish to create your own, you should follow the directions on the
.Nx
Bootable CD-ROM HOW-TO at:
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/docs/bootcd.html#sparcimage
.Pp
Once you have downloaded
.Pa NetBSD-\*V-sparc.iso
or created your own disk image, then you need to burn it to a CD-R.
.Pp
The CD-ROM attached to your Sparc must support 512 byte sectors to be
bootable.
All Sun brand CD-ROMs will work, as well as many other manufacturers.
See the Sun CD-ROM FAQ:
.Lk http://saturn.tlug.org/suncdfaq/
.Pp
Sun sets their CD-ROM drives to SCSI ID 6.
We recommend you do the same.
.Pp
Boot the installer by typing the appropriate command at the PROM prompt:
.Pp
.(tag OpenBoot\ PROM\ 2 -offset indent -compact
.It sunmon
.(disp
.No \*[Gt] Ic b "sd(,30,)"
.disp)
.It OpenBoot PROM 1
.(disp
.No ok Ic "boot sd(,30,)"
.disp)
.It OpenBoot PROM 2
.(disp
.No ok Ic "boot cdrom"
.disp)
.tag)
.Pp
After the initial probe messages you'll be asked to start the
install or upgrade procedure.
Proceed to the section
.Sx Running the installation scripts.
below.
.
.Ss2 Installing NetBSD by using a netboot setup
.
.so ../common/netboot
.Pp
Now, netboot your Sparc from the server by entering the appropriate
.Ic boot
command at the monitor prompt.
Depending on the PROM version in your machine, this command takes one
of the following forms:
.(tag OpenBoot\ PROM\ 2 -offset indent -compact
.It sunmon
.(disp
.No \*[Gt] Ic "b le()netbsd"
.disp)
.It OpenBoot PROM 1
.(disp
.No ok Ic "b le()netbsd"
.disp)
.It OpenBoot PROM 2
.(disp
.No ok Ic "boot net netbsd"
.disp)
.tag)
.Pp
After the initial probe messages you'll be asked to start the
install or upgrade procedure.
Proceed to the section
.Sx Running the installation scripts.
below.
.
.Ss2 Installing NetBSD by using a bootable tape
.
Sun sets their tape drives to SCSI ID 4.
We recommend you do the same.
.Pp
Get the tape images
.Pq Pa installation/tape/tapefile1.gz No and Pa installation/tape/tapefile2
and transfer them to a tape.
Make sure you use the
.Sq no rewind scsi tape
device.
Run the following commands:
.Pp
.(disp
.No # Ic "gunzip tapefile1.gz"
.No # Ic "mt -f /dev/nrst0 rew"
.No # Ic "dd if=tapefile1 of=/dev/nrst0 bs=4k conv=osync"
.No # Ic "dd if=tapefile2 of=/dev/nrst0 bs=4k conv=osync"
.disp)
.Pp
Now you can transfer the
.Nx \*V .
distribution sets from
.Pq Pa binary/sets
to the tape by using a series of additional
.(disp
.No # Ic "dd if=\*[Lt]aset\*[Gt].\*[setsuffix] of=/dev/nrst0 bs=4k conv=osync"
.disp)
commands.
See also the section
.Sx Getting the NetBSD System on to Useful Media.
Be sure to mark the location of these files on the tape; you'll need them
during the installation procedure.
.Pp
Insert the tape into your Sparc's tapestation.
Boot the installer by typing the appropriate command at the PROM prompt:
.Pp
.(tag OpenBoot\ PROM\ 2\ (alternate) -offset indent -compact
.It sunmon
.(disp
.No \*[Gt] Ic "b st()"
.disp)
.It OpenBoot PROM 1
.(disp
.No ok Ic "boot st()"
.disp)
.It OpenBoot PROM 2
.(disp
.No ok Ic "boot tape"
.disp)
.tag)
.Pp
After the initial probe messages you'll be asked to confirm the tape
device and tape file number containing the installation tools.
Then, proceed to the section
.Sx Running the installation scripts.
below.
.
.Ss2 Running the installation scripts
.
The first thing that the installation scripts will inquire about is the
type of console you're using on your machine.
If you're using a Sun frame buffer display, choose the terminal type
.Ic sun
.Pq this is presented as the default .
.(Note
if your frame buffer device is a cgsix Sbus board, you should
change the terminal type to
.Ic sun-cgsix
to avoid triggering a bug in the board's firmware code that can garble
your screen.
.Note)
.Pp
If you're using a terminal device connected to a serial port, choose a
terminal type appropriate for that device, e.g.
.Ic vt100
or
.Ic vt200 .
.Pp
Next, you will be presented with a choice of two installation methods:
a new full-screen
.Ic sysinst
program, or the traditional script-based
.Ic miniroot
program.
The
.Ic sysinst
program is easier to use, but the
.Ic miniroot
program is more flexible.
Both of these installation methods will follow the
same set of procedures and will fully install
.Nx
on your Sparc.
.Pp
You will frequently be asked for confirmation before the system proceeds
with each phase of the installation process.
.Pp
Occasionally, you will have to provide a piece of information such as the
name of the disk you want to install on, partitioning information,
or IP addresses and domain names you want to assign.
If your system has
more than one disk, you may want to look at the output of the
.Xr dmesg 8
command to see how your disks have been identified by the kernel.
.(Note
If you repartition a hard drive, be certain that every partition starts
on a cylinder boundary for compatibility with the Sparc ROM.
.Note)
.Pp
The installation script goes through the following phases:
.(bullet -compact
determination of the disk on which to install
.Nx
.It
checking/creation of the partition information on the disk
.It
creating and mounting the
.Nx
file systems
.It
setup of network configuration
.It
extraction of the distribution tar files
.It
installation of bootstrap programs
.bullet)
.Pp
Now try a reboot.
Initially we'd suggest you
.Ic "boot sd()netbsd -bs" ,
then try multiuser after that.
If you boot single-user the
.Nx
incantation to make the root file system writable is
.Pp
.(disp
.No # Ic "mount -u /dev/sd0a /"
.disp)
.Pp
Your PROM might have been setup to instruct the boot program to load
a file called
.Pa vmunix .
On OpenBoot PROM systems you can change it to load
.Pa netbsd
instead using the following commands:
.Pp
.(tag OpenBoot\ PROM\ 2 -offset indent -compact
.It OpenBoot PROM 1
.(disp
.No ok Ic setenv boot-from sd(0,0,0)netbsd
.disp)
.It OpenBoot PROM 2
.(disp
.No ok Ic setenv boot-file netbsd
.No ok Ic setenv boot-device disk:a
.disp)
.tag)
.Pp
.Em Congratulations ,
you have successfully installed
.Nx \*V .
