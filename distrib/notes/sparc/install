Installing
.Nx
is a relatively complex process, but if you have
this document in hand it shouldn't be too much trouble.
.Pp
There are several ways to install
.Nx
onto your system. The easiest way is to use the
.Pa miniroot.fs
image copied to your local disk's swap partition or a scratch drive.
If your Sparc is hooked up in a network, you may configure another
.Ul
machine as a netboot server for your Sparc.  Alternatively, there is a pair
of floppy images that will boot your system and run the installer.
.Pp
For more information on the commands and variables available in
the OpenBoot PROM (present in all sun4c and sun4m machines), go to
.Lk http://docs.sun.com
and search for
.Dq openboot reference
(without quotes).
.
.Ss2 Installing NetBSD by placing a bootable filesystem on a partitioned hard drive
.
.Pa installation/miniroot/miniroot.fs.gz
is a compressed, self-contained
.Nx
filesystem holding all utilities necessary to install
.Nx
onto a disk attached to your system. It is distributed as a compressed plain
file you will transfer to a raw disk partition.  You will then boot
this installer using the appropriate PROM command.  The simplest case is
where you place the
.Pa miniroot.fs
filesystem on the swap partition of your disk. Alternatively, you can place
it on any other unused partition on any disk (such as a Zip disk).  Be
forewarned that you will not be able to install
.Nx
onto the partition that contains the
.Pa miniroot.fs
as this partition is needed during the install process.
.Pp
Loading the filesystem onto a raw partition is straightforward.
First, download
.Pa miniroot.fs
to your system.  Next, reboot in single-user mode (i.e.
.Ic "boot -s" )
to ensure that your system will not be swapping.
Finally, place the
.Pa miniroot.fs
on your partition of choice.  On
.Nx
or SunOS the commands are:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "gunzip miniroot.fs.gz"
.Dl # Ic "dd if=miniroot.fs of=/dev/rsd0b bs=4k conv=sync"
.Pp
Here,
.Li /dev/rsd0b
is assumed to be your swap partition.  If you decide to
place
.Pa miniroot.fs
on a non-swap partition, it will overwrite all of the contents of that
partition, but you will not need to reboot into single-user mode to write it.
.Pp
After transferring the filesystem to disk, bring the system down by:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic halt
.Pp
Then boot the installer by typing the appropriate
command at the PROM prompt (this example is for the swap partition):
.Pp
.(tag OpenBoot\ PROM\ 2 -offset indent -compact
.It sunmon
.Li \*> Ic "b sd(,,1)netbsd -s"
.It OpenBoot PROM 1
.Li ok Ic "boot sd(,,1)netbsd -s"
.It OpenBoot PROM 2
.Li ok Ic "boot disk:b netbsd -s"
.tag)
.Pp
The monitor boot command will load the
.Nx
kernel contained in the
filesystem image. After the initial probe messages you'll be
asked to start the install or upgrade procedure. Proceed to the section
.Sx Running the installation scripts.
below.
.
.Ss2 Installing NetBSD by using a bootable CD-ROM
.
If you wish to burn a CD-R containing a bootable NetBSD installation,
then you can either burn the prepared disk image in
.Pa installation/cdrom/netbsd-sparc.iso
or create your own.
If you wish to create your own, you should follow the directions on the
.Nx
Bootable CD-ROM HOW-TO at:
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/bootcd.html#sparcimage
.Pp
Once you have downloaded
.Pa netbsd-sparc.iso
or created your own disk image, then you need to burn it to a CD-R.
.Pp
The CD-ROM attached to your Sparc must support 512 byte sectors to be
bootable.
All Sun brand CD-ROMs will work, as well as many other manufacturers.  See
the Sun CD-ROM FAQ:
.Lk http://saturn.tlug.org/suncdfaq/
.Pp
Sun sets their CD-ROM drives to SCSI ID 6.  We recommend you do the same.
.Pp
Boot the installer by typing the appropriate command at the PROM prompt:
.Pp
.(tag OpenBoot\ PROM\ 2 -offset indent -compact
.It sunmon
.Li \*> Ic b "sd(,30,)"
.It OpenBoot PROM 1
.Li ok Ic "boot sd(,30,)"
.It OpenBoot PROM 2
.Li ok Ic "boot cdrom"
.tag)
.Pp
After the initial probe messages you'll be asked to start the
install or upgrade procedure. Proceed to the section
.Sx Running the installation scripts.
below.
.
.Ss2 Installing NetBSD by using the bootable floppies
.
The
.Nx
install floppies only work on the sun4c and sun4m machines.
Making the install floppies is fairly straightforward.
.Pp
.Nx
and SunOS use the same commands.  First, get two 1.44 MB
floppy disks and format them either using the
.Xr fdformat 8
command or a PC.
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "fdformat"
.Pp
Be sure that the `fdformat' command completes successfully before proceeding;
on
.Nx
success is a string of all
.Sq Li V 's ,
and on
.Tn SunOS
success is a string of
.Sq Li \&. 's .
.Pp
Next, transfer the two floppy images
.Pq Pa installation/floppy/disk1.gz No and Pa installation/floppy/disk2
to the disks you just formatted.
You can do this step from
.Nx ,
.Tn SunOS ,
or a
.Tn Windows
machine using
.Nm rawrite.exe
(available in the NetBSD/i386 distribution).
Insert the first floppy and run the following commands:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "gunzip disk1.gz"
.Dl # Ic "dd if=disk1 of=/dev/rfd0a bs=36k"
.Dl # Ic "eject floppy"
.Pp
Insert the second floppy and run the following commands:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "dd if=disk2 of=/dev/rfd0a bs=36k conv=sync"
.Dl # Ic "eject floppy"
.Pp
Be sure to label your floppies so you can later identify them.
.Pp
Insert the floppy made from
.Pa disk1
into your Sparc.
From the OpenBoot prompt, boot the floppy with the following command:
.Pp
.(tag OpenBoot\ PROM\ 2\ (alternate) -offset indent -compact
.It OpenBoot PROM 1
.Li ok Ic "boot fd(,,1)"
.It OpenBoot PROM 1 (alternate)
.Li ok Ic "boot /fd"
.It OpenBoot PROM 2
.Li ok Ic "boot floppy"
.tag)
.Pp
After the initial probe messages you'll be asked to insert the floppy
labeled
.Dq NetBSD disk2 .
If the floppy is not automatically ejected, you can either use a
straightened paperclip to eject the disk or do the following:
.Pp
Press the
.Key STOP
key (sometimes called the
.Key L1
key, found on the left side of your keyboard) and the
.Key a
key, which will halt your system and give you a PROM prompt.
.Dl ok Ic "eject"
.Dl ok Ic "go"
.Pp
Now, insert the floppy labeled
.Li disk2 .
After the installation tools have been loaded,
you'll be asked to start the install or upgrade procedure.
Proceed to the section
.Sx Running the installation scripts.
below.
.
.Ss2 Installing NetBSD by using a netboot setup
.
First, you must setup a netboot server to provide the services and files
your client needs. If you are using a
.Nx
system as the netboot server, have a look at the
.Xr diskless 8
manual page for a more detailed guide on how to proceed with this.
If the server runs another operating system, you should consult the
.Nx
Diskless HOW-TO, which will walk you through the steps necessary to
configure a netboot server on a variety of platforms.
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/network/netboot/
.Pp
This section will briefly describe what happens during a Sparc
netboot, and the next section will give a brief set of directions on how
to set up your server. Your Sparc initially broadcasts a RARP request, and
expects a server to reply with your client's IP address.
Next, it downloads a second stage bootstrap program via TFTP from the server
that responded to the RARP request. It will look for a filename composed of
the machine's IP address followed by the machine's architecture, separated
by a period. For example, a sun4c machine which has been assigned IP
address 130.115.144.11, will make an TFTP request for
.Pa 8273900B.SUN4C .
This file is a symbolic link to the second-stage
boot program, which should be located in a place where the TFTP daemon
can find it (remember, many TFTP daemons run in a chroot'ed environment).
.Pp
The boot program to use is
.Pa installation/netboot/boot.net
Alternatively, you can find the bootstrap program in
.Pa /usr/mdec/boot.net
in the
.Nx*M
distribution.
.(Note
The only difference between
.Pa /usr/mdec/boot.net
and
.Pa /usr/mdec/boot
is in the a.out header, which has been magically transformed in a way that
makes it usable on all versions of Sparc PROMs.
.Note)
.Pp
After the boot program has been loaded into memory and given control by
the PROM, it starts locating the machine's remote root directory through
the BOOTPARAM protocol. First a BOOTPARAM WHOAMI request is broadcast
on the local net. The answer to this request should contain
the client's name. This name is used in next step, a BOOTPARAM GETFILE
request - sent to the server that responded to the WHOAMI request -
requesting the name and address of the machine that will serve the client's
root directory, as well as the path of the client's root on that server.
.Pp
Finally, this information is used to issue a REMOTE MOUNT
request to the client's root filesystem server, asking for an NFS file
handle corresponding to the root filesystem. Once the NFS mount is complete,
the boot program starts reading from the remote root filesystem in search of
the kernel which is then read into memory.
.Pp
.
.Ss2 Configuring your netboot server
.
Follow this section to configure a
.Nx
machine as your netboot server.  We will use
.Sq Li CC:CC:CC:CC:CC:CC
as the MAC address (ethernet hardware address) of your netboot client
machine that you wish to install
.Nx
on.  We use
.Sq Li 192.168.1.10
as the IP address of your client, and
.Sq Li client.test.net
as the name.  The server name is
.Sq Li server.test.net ,
and the path on the server to the NFS exported directory is
.Pa /export/client/root
although you may choose to use a different path.  Create an
.Pa /etc/ethers
file with the following line:
.Pp
.Dl "CC:CC:CC:CC:CC:CC     client"
.Pp
Add your client to the server's
.Pa /etc/hosts
file:
.Pp
.Dl "192.168.1.10 client"
.Pp
If
.Ic rarpd
is currently running, restart it (kill -HUP), otherwise start
.Ic rarpd :
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "/usr/sbin/rarpd -a"
.Pp
Next, create
.Pa /etc/bootparams
with the following line:
.Pp
.Dl "client root=server:/export/client/root"
.Pp
If
.Ic rpc.bootparamd
is currently running, restart it
.Pq Ic "kill -HUP" ,
otherwise start
.Ic rpc.bootparamd :
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "/usr/sbin/rpc.bootparamd"
.Pp
Now, make sure the bootloader in
.Pa /tftpboot
is linked to, or a copy of,
.Pa boot.net
and is named appropriately for your client
(in this case, it would be
.Pa C0A8010A.SUN4C ) ,
E.g.:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "cp boot.net /tftpboot"
.Dl # Ic "cd /tftpboot"
.Dl # Ic "ln -s boot.net C0A8010A.SUN4C"
.Pp
Now, you should edit
.Pa /etc/inetd.conf
and make sure that the line starting with
.Li tftp
is uncommented.  You will need to
.Ic kill -HUP
the
.Ic inetd
process to enable tftp if this line was previously commented out.
The next step is to set up NFS exports.  Create the directory you are
exporting for the netboot client:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "mkdir -p /export/client/root"
.Pp
Put the following line in
.Pa /etc/exports
to enable NFS sharing:
.Pp
.Dl "/export/client/root -maproot=root client.test.net"
.Pp
If your server is currently running NFS services, you only need to
.Ic "kill -HUP"
the
.Ic mountd
process.  Otherwise, you need to run:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "/usr/sbin/mountd"
.Dl # Ic "/usr/sbin/nfsd -tun 4"
.Pp
Now, you need to place the files your netboot client will need.
As noted above in the section
.Sx Preparing your System for NetBSD Installation
you have several options when choosing a location to store the
distribution filesets.
However, the easiest way is to put the distribution
files into the exported directory for your client on the server.
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "mv *.tgz /export/client/root"
.Pp
Your client will need a kernel to boot (use
.Pa binary/kernel/netbsd.GENERIC.gz ) .
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "gunzip netbsd.GENERIC.gz"
.Dl # Ic "mv netbsd.GENERIC /export/client/root/netbsd"
.Pp
Your client will need installation tools (use
.Pa installation/netboot/rootfs.tgz ) .
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "gunzip \*< rootfs.tgz | (cd /export/client/root && tar -xpf -)"
.Pp
Now, netboot your Sparc from the server by entering the appropriate
.Ic boot command at the monitor prompt.
Depending on the PROM version in your machine, this command takes one
of the following forms:
.(tag OpenBoot\ PROM\ 2 -offset indent -compact
.It sunmon
.Li \*> Ic "b le()netbsd"
.It OpenBoot PROM 1
.Li ok Ic "b le()netbsd"
.It OpenBoot PROM 2
.Li ok Ic "b net netbsd"
.tag)
.Pp
After the initial probe messages you'll be asked to start the
install or upgrade procedure. Proceed to the section
.Sx Running the installation scripts.
below.
.
.Ss2 Installing NetBSD by using a bootable tape
.
Sun sets their tape drives to SCSI ID 4. We recommend you do the same.
.Pp
Get the tape images
.Pq Pa installation/tape/tapefile1.gz No and Pa installation/tape/tapefile2
and transfer them to a tape.  Make sure you use the
.Sq no rewind scsi tape
device.  Run the following commands:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "gunzip tapefile1.gz"
.Dl # Ic "mt -f /dev/nrst0 rew"
.Dl # Ic "dd if=tapefile1 of=/dev/nrst0 bs=4k"
.Dl # Ic "dd if=tapefile2 of=/dev/nrst0 bs=4k"
.Pp
Now you can transfer the
.Nx \*V.
distribution sets from
.Pq Pa binary/sets
to the tape by using a series of additional
.Dl # Ic "dd if=\*<aset\*>.tgz of=/dev/nrst0 bs=4k"
commands.  See also the section
.Sx Getting the NetBSD System on to Useful Media.
Be sure to mark the location of these files on the tape; you'll need them
during the installation procedure.
.Pp
Insert the tape into your Sparc's tapestation.
Boot the installer by typing the appropriate command at the PROM prompt:
.Pp
.(tag OpenBoot\ PROM\ 2\ (alternate) -offset indent -compact
.It sunmon
.Li \*> Ic "b st()"
.It OpenBoot PROM 1
.Li ok Ic "boot st()"
.It OpenBoot PROM 2
.Li ok Ic "boot tape"
.tag)
.Pp
After the initial probe messages you'll be asked to confirm the tape
device and tape file number containing the installation tools.
Then, proceed to the section
.Sx Running the installation scripts.
below.
.
.Ss2 Running the installation scripts
.
The first thing that the installation scripts will inquire about is the
type of console you're using on your machine. If you're using a Sun
frame buffer display, choose the terminal type
.Ic sun
.Pq this is presented as the default .
.(Note
if your frame buffer device is a cgsix Sbus board, you should
change the terminal type to
.Ic sun-cgsix
to avoid triggering a bug in the board's firmware code that can garble
your screen.
.Note)
.Pp
If you're using a terminal device connected to a serial port, choose a
terminal type appropriate for that device, e.g.
.Ic vt100
or
.Ic vt200 .
.Pp
Next, you will be presented with a choice of two installation methods:
a new full-screen
.Ic sysinst
program, or the traditional script-based
.Ic miniroot
program. The
.Ic sysinst
program is easier to use, but the
.Ic miniroot
program is more flexible.  Both of these installation methods will follow the
same set of procedures and will fully install
.Nx
on your Sparc.
.Pp
You will frequently be asked for confirmation before the system proceeds
with each phase of the installation process.
.Pp
Occasionally, you will have to provide a piece of information such as the
name of the disk you want to install on, partitioning information,
or IP addresses and domain names you want to assign. If your system has
more than one disk, you may want to look at the output of the
.Xr dmesg 8
command to see how your disks have been identified by the kernel.
.(Note
If you repartition a hard drive, be certain that every partition starts
on a cylinder boundary for compatability with the Sparc ROM.
.Note)
.Pp
The installation script goes through the following phases:
.(bullet -compact
determination of the disk on which to install
.Nx
.It
checking/creation of the partition information on the disk
.It
creating and mounting the
.Nx
filesystems
.It
setup of network configuration
.It
extraction of the distribution tar files
.It
installation of bootstrap programs
.bullet)
.Pp
Now try a reboot.  Initially we'd suggest you
.Ic "boot sd()netbsd -bs" ,
then try multiuser after that. If you boot single-user the
.Nx
incantation to make the root filesystem writable is
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "mount -u /dev/sd0a /"
.Pp
Your PROM might have been setup to instruct the boot program to load
a file called
.Pa vmunix .
On OpenBoot PROM systems you can change it to load
.Pa netbsd
instead using the following commands:
.Pp
.(tag OpenBoot\ PROM\ 2 -offset indent -compact
.It OpenBoot PROM 1
.Li ok Ic setenv boot-from sd(0,0,0)netbsd
.It OpenBoot PROM 2
.Li ok Ic setenv boot-file netbsd
.br
.Li ok Ic setenv boot-device disk:a
.tag)
.Pp
.Em Congratulations ,
you have successfully installed
.Nx \*V.
