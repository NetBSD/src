NetBSD/sparc \*V runs on the following classes of machines:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.	It
sun4c (e.g. the SS1, SS1+, SS2, IPC, ELC, IPX, and SLC)
.	It
sun4 (e.g. the 4/100, 4/200, and 4/300 \- note that support
for the 4/400 processor is incomplete)
.	It
sun4m (e.g. Classic, LX, SS4, SS5, SS10, and SS20)
.El
.Pp
NetBSD/sparc \*V does
.Em not
run on these machines (yet):
.Bl -bullet -compact
.	It
sun-4/400 (lacking support for the I/O cache, and has
ethernet problems)
.	It
sun4d (e.g. sparc center 2000)
.	It
sun4u (e.g. Ultrasparcs)
.El
.Pp
The minimal configuration requires 4M of RAM and ~60M of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  (NetBSD with 4M of
RAM feels like Solaris with 4M of RAM.) Note that until you have
around 16M of RAM, getting more RAM is more important than getting a
faster CPU.)
.Pp
Supported devices include:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.	It Em sun4c/sun4m sbus video: 
cgsix, cgthree, and bwtwo frame buffers
.		br
cgfourteen and tcx frame buffers (limited
.Dq emulation
mode)
.	It Em sun4 video (not thoroughly tested?): 
P4 on-board bwtwo, and VME cgtwo card
.	It Em serial ports: 
ttya and ttyb (can be used as console if needed)
.	It Em ethernet: 
on-board AMD Lance ethernet ("le0"), 
.		br
Sbus AMD Lance ethernet cards, 
.		br
on-board Intel 82586 ethernet (ie0 on 4/100's and 4/200's), 
.		br
VME Intel 82586 ethernet cards
.	It Em SCSI: 
on-board "esp" SCSI controller (sun4c, sun4m and the 4/300),
.		br
sbus "esp" SCSI controller, 
.		br
Sun "SUN-3"/"si" VME SCSI controller (polled mode only, slow),
.		br
Sun "SCSI Weird"/"sw" on-board controller (4/110 only, polled)
.	It Em VME disks:
Xylogics 7053 VME/SMD disk controller ("xd"),
.		br
Xylogics 450/451 VME disk controller ("xy")
.		br
[note: VME/IPI disks are not supported]
.	It Em sun floppy disk drive
.	It Em sun keyboard and mouse
.	It Em sun4c audio
.	It Em sun4m audio on Sparcstation Classic
.El
.Pp
Hardware the we do NOT currently support, but get many questions
about:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.	It
multiprocessor sun4m machines
.	It
audio drivers for sun4m machines (other than the Sparcstation Classic)
.	It
interrupt driven SCSI driver for sun-4/100's and sun-4/200's
