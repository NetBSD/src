The sparc-specific portion of the NetBSD _VER release is found in the
"sparc" subdirectory of the distribution.  That subdirectory is laid
out as follows:

.../NetBSD-_VER/sparc/

	INSTALL			Installation notes (this file);

	binary/
		sets/		sparc binary distribution sets;
				see below;

		security/	sparc security distribution;
				see below;

		kernel/		Base GENERIC kernels;

	installation/

		miniroot/	sparc miniroot boot-image;


		netboot/	server boot-file image for diskless
				machines.


The NetBSD/sparc binary distribution sets contain the binaries which
comprise the NetBSD _VER release for the sparc.  There are seven binary
distribution sets, and the "security" distribution set.  The binary
distribution sets can be found in subdirectories of the "sparc/binary"
subdirectory of the NetBSD _VER distribution tree, and are as follows:

	base	The NetBSD/sparc _VER base binary distribution.  You
		MUST install this distribution set.  It contains the
		base NetBSD utilities that are necessary for the
		system to run and be minimally functional.  It
		includes shared library support, and excludes
		everything described below.
		[ 10.4M gzipped, 31.3M uncompressed ]

	comp	The NetBSD/sparc Compiler tools.  All of the tools
		relating to C, C++, Objective C, and FORTRAN (yes,
		there are two, although NO FORTRAN compiler!).
		This set includes the system include files
		(/usr/include), the linker, the compiler tool chain,
		and the various system libraries (except the shared
		libraries, which are included as part of the base
		set).  This set also includes the manual pages for all
		of the utilities it contains, as well as the system
		call and library manual pages.
		[ 7.9M gzipped, 28.0M uncompressed ]

	etc	This distribution set contains the system
		configuration files that reside in /etc and in several
		other places.  This set MUST be installed if you are
		installing the system from scratch, but should NOT be
		used if you are upgrading.  (If you are upgrading,
		it's recommended that you get a copy of this set and
		CAREFULLY upgrade your configuration files by hand.)
		[ 57K gzipped, 348K uncompressed ]

	games	This set includes the games and their manual pages.
		[ 3.1M gzipped, 7.8M uncompressed ]

	man	This set includes all of the manual pages for the
		binaries and other software contained in the base set.
		Note that it does not include any of the manual pages
		that are included in the other sets.
		[ 2.5M gzipped, 10.4M uncompressed ]

	misc	This set includes the system dictionaries (which are
		rather large), the typesettable document set, and
		man pages for other architectures which happen to be
		installed from the source tree by default.
		[ 2.2M gzipped, 8.6M uncompressed ]

	text	This set includes NetBSD's text processing tools,
		including groff, all related programs, and their
		manual pages.
		[ 1.0M gzipped, 4.0M uncompressed ]

	xbase	This set includes X11R6.3 programs, libraries and manual
		pages.
		[ 2.8M gzipped, 8.8M uncompressed ]

	xcomp	This set includes X11R6.3 header files, static libraries
		and manual pages needed to compile X Windows programs.
		[ 1.8M gzipped, 7.7M uncompressed ]

	xcontrib This set is the X11R6.3 contributed software collection,
		made up from programs in the contrib distribution.
		[ 0.2M gzipped, 0.7M uncompressed ]

	xfont	This set contains the X11R6.3 fonts.
		[ 5.9M gzipped, 7.3M uncompressed ]

	xserver	This set contains X Windows server programs and accompanying
		manual pages.
		[ 3.3M gzipped, 8.7M uncompressed ]


The sparc security distribution set is named "secr" and can be found
in the "sparc/security" subdirectory of the NetBSD _VER distribution
tree.  It contains crypt.c (the source file for the DES encryption
algorithm) and the binaries which depend on it.  It can only be found
on those sites which carry the complete NetBSD distribution and that
can legally obtain it.  (Remember, because of United States law, it
may not be legal to distribute this set to locations outside of the
United States and Canada.)  [ 127K gzipped, 337K uncompressed ]

The sparc binary distribution sets are distributed in the same form as
the source distribution sets; catted together, the members of a set
form a gzipped tar file.  Each sparc binary distribution set also has
its own "CKSUMS" file, just as the source distribution sets do.  The
binary sets are "rooted" at /, that is, if you want to extract the
binaries "into" your system, i.e.  replace the system binaries with
them, you have to run the "tar xfp" from /.

Note the distribution cannot be extracted using the SunOS "tar" program so
SunOS statically-linked versions of gzip (GNU gzip) and gtar (GNU tar)
are provided in `sparc/installation/misc'.
