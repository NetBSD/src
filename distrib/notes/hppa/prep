.Ss2 Get to the Boot Administration prompt
.
All \*M workstations have a Boot Administration command line 
utility in their Boot ROM which lets you configure various settings.  For 
example, you can set whether the system automatically boots an OS, which 
device to try booting from first, determine the ethernet MAC address, set 
up a serial console, and possibly do some low level hardware access.  
.Pp
To get to the 
.Li BOOT_ADMIN\*[Gt]
prompt, you must press the
.Key ESCAPE
key before it tries to boot an OS.  Since these machines often take a 
long time between powering on and the brief window of time where you can 
hit the
.Key ESCAPE
key, you must pay attention.  Depending on how much RAM your system has, it 
may take over a minute after pressing the power button before anything 
will show up on screen.
.Pp
Once you have escaped out of the 
.Li "Selecting a system to boot"
and
.Li "Searching for Potential Boot Devices"
you need to type the
.Key Sq a
key to get to the 
.Li BOOT_ADMIN\*[Gt]
prompt.  Now, use the online help with the 
.Ic help
command.
.Pp
Write down the ethernet address.
You will need this later to configure the netboot server for your
.Nx*M
system.

.Ss2 Change the configuration parameters to netboot
.
The command syntax is different on the various models.  Use the 
.Ic "help path" ,
.Ic "help lan" ,
and
.Ic "help autoselect"
commands to learn about how to configure your system.
On a 735/99, you would type:
.(disp
.No BOOT_ADMIN\*[Gt] Ic "path primary lan"
.No BOOT_ADMIN\*[Gt] Ic "autoselect on"
.No BOOT_ADMIN\*[Gt] Ic "reset"
.disp)
.Pp
The first command sets the primary boot device to be the network 
interface, and the second command sets the system to always try booting
from the primary boot path when it is reset or powered on.  The last 
command stores the new settings and resets the machine.
.Pp
To return to using the SCSI disk at ID 6 as your primary boot device, you 
would use something like the following command:
.(disp
.No BOOT_ADMIN\*[Gt] Ic "path primary scsi.6.0"
.disp)
.
.Ss2 Determine netboot method
.
Most older Series 700 workstations (with PA-7000 (PCXS), PA-7100 (PCXT),
or PA-7150 (PCXT)) use the RMP (Remote Maintenance Protocol) to netboot. 
Specifically, they retrieve their boot program from an
.Xr rbootd 8
server.  The following list of RMP-only Series 700 workstations is
probably complete, but has not been tested:

Newer Series 700 workstations retrieve their boot program from a server 
running
