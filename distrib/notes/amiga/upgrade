The upgrade to
.Nx \*V
is a binary upgrade; it can be quite difficult
to advance to a later version by recompiling from source due primarily
to interdependencies in the various components.
.Pp
To do the upgrade, you must have the
.Nx
kernel on
.Tn AmigaDOS
and you must transfer the miniroot file system
.Pa miniroot.fs
onto the swap partition of the
.Nx
hard disk.
You must also have at least the
.Sy base
binary distribution set available, so that you can upgrade
with it, using one of the upgrade methods described above.
Finally, you must have sufficient disk space available to install the new
binaries.
Since the old binaries are being overwritten in place, you only need
space for the new binaries, which weren't previously on the system.
If you have a few megabytes free on each of your
.Pa /
(root) and
.Pa /usr
partitions, you should have enough space.
.Pp
Since upgrading involves replacing the kernel, and most of the system
binaries, it has the potential to cause data loss.
You are strongly advised to BACK UP ANY IMPORTANT DATA ON YOUR DISK,
whether on the
.Nx
partition or on another operating system's partition, before
beginning the upgrade process.
.Pp
To upgrade your system, follow the following instructions:
.Pp
Transfer the miniroot file system onto the hard disk partition
used by
.Nx
for swapping, as described in the "Preparing
your System for
.Nx
Installation" section above.
.Pp
Now boot up
.Nx
using the \*V kernel using the loadbsd
command:
.Pp
.Dl Ic "loadbsd -b netbsd"
.Pp
If you machine has a split memory space, like, e.g., DraCo
machines, use this instead:
.Pp
.Dl Ic "loadbsd -bn2 netbsd"
.Pp
If you have a M680x0 + PPC board, make sure the PPC cpu is inactive
before using loadbsd, else the kernel will hang!
.Ss2 Directly booting
.Nx ,
with boot blocks installed
.(Note
This description is for V40 (OS 3.1) ROMs.
For older ROMs, there might be small differences.
Check your
.Tn AmigaDOS
documentation to learn about the exact procedure.
Booting using bootblocks doesn't work at all on some systems, and may
require a mountable file system on others.
.Note)
.Pp
Reboot your machine, holding down both mouse buttons if you
have a 2-button mouse, the outer mouse buttons if you have
a 3-button mouse.
On the DraCo, press the left mouse button instead,
when the boot screen prompts you for it.
.Pp
From the boot menu, select
.Ic Boot Options .
Select the swap partition with the miniroot, and then
.Ic ok .
Select
.Ic Boot
now.
The machine will boot the bootblock, which will prompt your for a command line.
You have a few seconds time to change the default.
Entering an empty line will accept the
default.
.Pp
The bootblock uses command lines of the form:
.Ar \ \ \ \ file Op Ar options
where
.Ar file
is the kernel file name on the partition where the
boot block is on, and
.Ar options
are the same as with loadbsd.
E.g., instead of
.Pp
.Dl Ic "loadbsd -bsSn2 netbsd"
.Pp
use
.Pp
.Dl "netbsd -bsSn2"
.Pp
.
.Ss2 Once your kernel boots
.
You should see the screen clear and some information about
your system as the kernel configures the hardware.
Note which hard disk device is configured that contains your root
.Pq Pa /
and swap partitions.
When prompted for the root device, type
.Li sd0b
(replacing
.Sq Li 0
with the disk number that
.Nx
used for
your root/swap device).
When prompted for a dump device, answer
.Sq Ic none
for the upgrade.
(For a normal boot, you would tell it one of the swap devices).
When prompted for the root file system type, confirm
.Sq Ic generic ,
which will auto-detect it.
.Pp
You will be presented with some information about the upgrade
process and a warning message, and will be asked if you wish
to proceed with the upgrade process.
If you answer negatively, the upgrade process will stop, and your disk will
not be modified.
If you answer affirmatively, the upgrade process will begin,
and your disk will be modified.
You may press
.Key CONTROL-C
to stop the upgrade process at any time.
However, if you press it at an inopportune moment, your system
may be left in an inconsistent (and possibly unusable) state.
.Pp
You will now be greeted and reminded of the fact that this is a
potential dangerous procedure and that you should not upgrade the
.Sy etc
set.
.Pp
When you decide to proceed, you will be prompted to enter your root disk.
After you've done this, it will be checked
automatically to make sure that the file system is in a sane
state before making any modifications.
After this is done, you will be asked if you want to configure your network.
.Pp
You are now allowed to edit your fstab.
Normally you don't have to.
Note that the upgrade-kit uses it's own copy of the fstab.
Whatever you do here
.Em won't
affect your actual fstab.
After you are satisfied with your fstab, the upgrade-kit will check
all file systems mentioned in it.
When they're ok, they will be mounted.
.Pp
You will now be asked if your sets are stored on a normally
mounted file system.
You should answer
.Sq Ic y
to this question if
you have the sets stored on a file system that was present in the fstab.
The actions you should take for the set extraction
are pretty logical (we think).
.Pp
After you have extracted the sets, the upgrade kit will proceed
with setting the timezone and installing the kernel and bootcode.
This is all exactly the same as described in the installation
section.
.Pp
.Em Your system has now been upgraded to
.Nx \*V .
.Pp
After a new kernel has been copied to your hard disk, your
machine is a complete
.Nx \*V
system.
However, that doesn't mean that you're finished with the upgrade process.
There are several things that you should do, or might have to
do, to insure that the system works properly.
.Pp
You will probably want to get the
.Sy etc
distribution,
extract it, and compare its contents with those in your
.Pa /etc
directory.
You will probably want to replace some of your
system configuration files, or incorporate some of the changes
in the new versions into yours.
.Pp
You will want to delete old binaries that were part
of the version of
.Nx
that you upgraded from and have since
been removed from the
.Nx
distribution.
If upgrading from a
.Nx
version older than 1.0, you might also want to
recompile any locally-built binaries, to take advantage of the
shared libraries.
(Note that any new binaries that you build
will be dynamically linked, and therefore take advantage of
the shared libraries, by default.
For information on how to make statically linked binaries, see the
.Xr cc 1
and
.Xr ld 1
manual pages.)
