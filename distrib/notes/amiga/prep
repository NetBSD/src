You will need an AmigaDOS hard drive prep tool to prepare your hard
drives for use with NetBSD/Amiga.  HDToolBox is provided with the
system software and on floppy installation disks since Release 2.0
of AmigaDOS, so we will provide instructions for its use.
.
.Ss2 "Preparing your hard disk with HDToolBox"
.
.Pp
A full explanation of HDToolBox can be found with your
AmigaDOS manuals and is beyond the scope of this document.
.Pp
The first time you partition a drive, you need to set its drive
type so that you have working geometry parameters. To do this
you enter the "Change drive type" menu, and either use "read
parameters from drive" or set them manually.
.Pp
Note you will be modifying your HD's. If you mess something 
up here you could lose everything on all the drives that 
you configure.  It is therefore advised that you:
.Bl -enum
.It
Write down your current configurations.  Do this
by examining each partition on the drive and the
drives parameters (from Change drive type.)
.It
Back up the partitions you are keeping.
.El
What you need to do is partition your drives; creating at least
root, swap and /usr partitions and possibly at least one more for
/usr/local if you have the space.
.Pp
This should be done as the HDToolBox manual describes.  One thing
to note is that if you are not using a Commodore controller you
will need to specify the device your SCSI controller uses, e.g.
if you have a Warp Engine you would:
.Pp
from cli,
.Dl "hdtoolbox warpdrive.device"
.Pp
from wb set the tooltype,
.Dl "SCSI_DEVICE_NAME=warpdrive.device"
.Pp
The important things you need to do above and beyond normal
partitioning includes (from Partition Drive section):
.Bl -enum
.It
Marking all NetBSD partitions as non-bootable, with
two exceptions: the root partition, if you want to boot
NetBSD directly, or the swap partition, if you want
to boot the installation miniroot directly.
.It
Changing the file system parameters of the partitions
to NetBSD ones.  This must be done from the
partitioning section and `Advanced options' must
be enabled.
.El
.Pp
To Make the needed changes:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Click the `Adv. Options' button
.It
Click the `Change file system' button
.It
Choose `Custom File System'
.It
Turn off `Automount' if on.
.It
Set the dostype to one of these three choices:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
root partition  : 0x4e425207
swap partition  : 0x4e425301
other partitions: 0x4e425507
.Ed
.Pp
Here `other' refers to other partitions you will
format for reading and writing under NetBSD (e.g.
/usr)
.Pp
Make sure you hit the return key to enter this value
as some versions of HDToolBox will forget your entry
if you don't.
.It
Turn custom boot code off
.It
Set Reserved Blocks start and end to 0.
.It
Click Ok.
.El
.Pp
On the root (and, for installation, swap) partition,
set instead this:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Turn custom boot code on
.It
Set Reserved Blocks start and end to 0.
.It
Set Number of Custom Boot Blocks to 16
.It
Set Automount This Partition on
.It
Click Ok.
.Pp
Mask and maxtransfer are not used with NetBSD.
.El
.Pp
Once this is done NetBSD/Amiga will be able to recognize your
disks and which partitions it should use.
.
.Ss2 "Transferring the miniroot file system"
.
The NetBSD/Amiga installation or upgrade now uses a "miniroot"
file system which is installed on the partition used by NetBSD
for swapping.  This removes the requirement of using a floppy
disk for the file system used by the installation or upgrade
process.  It also allows more utilities to be present on the
file system than would be available when using an 880K floppy
disk.
.Pp
Once the hard disk has been prepared for NetBSD, the miniroot
file system (miniroot.fs) is transferred to the swap
partition configured during the hard disk prep (or the existing
swap partition in the case of an upgrade).  The xstreamtodev
utility provided in the "amiga/installation/misc" directory can
be used on AmigaDOS to transfer the file system for either a new
installation or an upgrade.  The file system can also be
transferred on an existing NetBSD system for an update by
using dd.  This should only be done after booting NetBSD
into single-user state.  It may also be possible to shutdown
to single-user, providing that the single-user state processes
are not using the swap partition.
.Pp
On AmigaDOS, the command:
.Dl "xstreamtodev --input=miniroot.fs --rdb-name=\*<swap partition\*>"
where \*<swap partition\*> is the name you gave to the NetBSD
partition to be used for swapping.  If xstreamtodev is unable
to determine the SCSI driver device name or the unit number
of the specified partition, you may also need to include the
option
.Dl --device=\*<driver.name\*>
and/or
.Dl --unit=\*<SCSI unit number\*>
.Pp
To transfer the miniroot using NetBSD, you should be booted up
in single user state on the current NetBSD system, or use the
"shutdown now" command to shutdown to single-user state.  Then
copy the miniroot using dd:
.Dl dd if=miniroot.fs of=/dev/rsd0b
where
.Pa /dev/rsd0b
should be the device path of the swap partition
your system is configured to use.  Once the file is copied,
reboot back to AmigaDOS to boot the upgrade kernel.
.(tag Em Caveat:
Once you have started installation, if you abort it
and want to retry you must reinstall the miniroot.fs on the swap
partition.
