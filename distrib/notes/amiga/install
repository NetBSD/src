Installing
.Nx
is a relatively complex process, but, if you have
this document in hand and are careful to read and remember the
information which is presented to you by the install program, it
shouldn't be too much trouble.
.Pp
Before you begin, you must have already prepared your hard disk as
detailed in the section on preparing your system for install.
.Pp
The following is a walk-through of the steps necessary to get
.Nx
installed on your hard disk.
If you wish to stop the installation, you may press
.Key CONTROL-C
at any prompt, but if you do, you'll have to
begin again from scratch.
.Pp
Transfer the miniroot file system onto the hard disk partition
used by
.Nx
for swapping, as described in the "Preparing
your System for
.Nx
Installation" section above.
.Ss2 Booting
.Nx ,
with boot blocks installed
.Pp
[This description is for V40 (OS 3.1) ROMs.
For older ROMs, there might be small differences.
Check your
.Tn AmigaDOS
documentation
to learn about the exact procedure.]
Using bootblocks may not work on some
systems, and may require a mountable file system on others.
.Pp
Reboot your machine, holding down both mouse buttons if you
have a 2-button mouse, the outer mouse buttons if you have
a 3-button mouse.
On the DraCo, press the left mouse button
instead, when the boot screen prompts you for it.
.Pp
From the boot menu, select
.Ic Boot Options .
Select the swap partition with the miniroot, and then
.Ic ok .
Select
.Ic Boot No now .
The machine will boot the bootblock, which
will prompt your for a command line.
You have a few seconds time to change the default.
Entering an empty line will accept the default.
.Pp
The bootblock uses command lines of the form:
.br
.Ar \ \ \ \ file Op Ar options
.br
.No where Ar file
is the kernel file name on the partition where the
boot block is on, and
.Op options
may contain the following:
.Pp
If you have an AGA machine, and your monitor will handle
the dblNTSC mode, you may include the
.Fl A
option to enable the dblNTSC display mode.
.Pp
If your machine has a fragmented physical memory space, as,
e.g., DraCo machines, you should add the
.Fl n2
option to enable the use of all memory segments.
.Ss2 Once your kernel boots
You should see the screen clear and some information about
your system as the kernel configures the hardware.
Note which hard disk device(s) are configured
.Pq Li sd0 , Li sd1 , No etc.
Then you will be prompted for a root device.
At this time type
.Li sd0b ,
where
.Li sd0
is the device which contains the swap
partition you created during the hard disk preparation.
When prompted for a dump device, answer
.Sq Ic none
for the install
(normally, you would tell it one of the swap devices).
When prompted for the root file system type, confirm
.Sq Ic generic ,
which will auto-detect it.
.Pp
If the system should hang after entering the root device, try
again with
.Pp
.Dl Ic "netbsd -I ff -b"
.Pp
This disables synchronous transfer on all SCSI devices on the first bus.
.Pp
The system should continue to boot.
For now ignore
.Dq WARNING
messages about bad dates in clocks, and a warning about
.Pa /etc/rc
not existing.
Eventually you will be be asked to enter the pathname of the shell, just press
.Key RETURN .
After a short while, you will be asked to select the type of your keyboard.
After
you have entered a valid response here, the system asks you if
you want to install or upgrade your system.
Since you are reading the
.Em install
section,
.Sq Ic i
would be the proper response here...
.Pp
The installer starts with a nice welcome messages.
Read this message carefully, it also informs you of the risks involved
in continuing!
If you still want to go on, type
.Sq Ic y .
The installer now continues by trying to figure out your disk configuration.
When it is done, you will be prompted to
select a root device from the list of disks it has found.
.Pp
You should know at this point that the disks are
.Em not
numbered according to their SCSI-ID!
The
.Nx
kernel numbers the SCSI
drives (and other devices on the SCSI bus) sequentially as it finds them.
The drive with the lowest SCSI-ID will be called
.Li sd0 ,
the next one
.Li sd1 ,
etc.
Also, any ATAPI disk drives (e.g. ZIP) 
will be configured as
.Dq SCSI
drives, too, and will be configured
before any
.Sq real
SCSI drives if connected to the Amiga internal port on A4000/A1200
(if any are present). Real IDE drives will be configured as 
.Li wd0 ,
.Li wd1 , 
etc.
.Pp
The installer will offer you to look at the
.Nx
disk label of the disks at this point.
You should do this, to find out
what partition letters the
.Nx
kernel assigned to the partitions you created, and as a check of whether the
disk number you are going to use is right.
.Pp
.Em you are now at the point of no return.
If you confirm that
you want to install
.Nx ,
your hard drive will be modified,
and perhaps its contents scrambled at the whim of the install
program.
Type
.Key Control-C
.Em now
if you don't want this.
.Pp
At this time, you will need to tell the installer which partition
will be associated with the different file systems.
Normally, you'll want to add a partition for
.Pa /usr ,
at least.
.(tag Caveat:
.It Em Caveat:
Do not use the
.Li rsd Ns Ar N Ns Li c
or
.Li sd Ns Ar N Ns Li c
partitions for anything!
They are for access to the whole disk only and do
.Em not
correspond to any Amiga partition!
.tag)
.Pp
The install program will now make the file systems you
specified.
There should be only one error per file system in
this section of the installation.
It will look like this:
.(disp
newfs: ioctl (WDINFO): Invalid argument
newfs: /dev/rsd0a: can't rewrite disk label
.disp)
.Pp
If there are any others, restart from the beginning of
the installation process.
This error is ok as the Amiga does not write disklabels currently.
You should expect this error whenever using newfs.
.Pp
The install will now ask you want to configure any network
information.
It will ask for the machine's host name, domain
name, and other network configuration information.
.Pp
Since the network configuration might have lead to additional (NFS)
file system entries, you get another chance to modify your fstab.
.Pp
You are finally at the point where some real data will be put on
your freshly made file systems.
Select the device type you wish to install from and off you go....
.Pp
Some notes:
.(bullet -offset indent
If you want to install from tape, please read the section
about how to create such a tape.
.It
Some tapes (e.g. Archive Viper 150) refuse to operate with
the default tape density
.Pq Li nrst0 .
Try
.Li nrst0h ,
.Li nrst0m ,
or
.Li nrst0l
instead.
.It
Install at least the
.Sy base
and
.Sy etc
sets.
.It
If you have to specify a path relative to the mount-point and
you need the mount-point itself, use
.Sq Pa \&. .
.bullet)
.Pp
Next you will be asked to specify the timezone.
Just select the timezone you are in.
The installer will make the correct setup on your root file system
.Pq Pa / .
After the timezone-link is installed,
the installer will proceed by creating the device nodes on your
root file system under
.Pa /dev .
.Pp
Be patient, this will take a while...
.Pp
Next, the installer will copy your keymap settings to the new system.
After this, it will copy the kernel from the installation miniroot to
the newly installed / upgraded system.
If the installed system already has a kernel, it will ask you for
confirmation.
.Pp If you are doing an upgrade and you did not install the
kern.tgz distribution set, this is an old kernel, and you should answer
"y" to install a working (although restricted) INSTALL kernel.
.Pp
If you did install the kern.tgz kernel, you normally should answer "n".
.Pp
Finally, the installer asks you if you want to install the bootblock
code on your root disk.
This is a matter of personal choice and can also be done from a running
.Nx
system.
See the
.Xr installboot 8
manual page about how to do this.
.Pp
Once the installer is done, halt the system with the
.Ic halt
command
(wait for
.Li halted
to be displayed) and reboot.
Then again boot
.Nx
this time selecting the root partition
.Pq Pa /
from the boot menu, and tell it to boot
.Pp
.Dl "netbsd -s"
.Pp
You need to do your final tweaks now.
First mount your file systems like so:
.Pp
.Dl Ic "mount -av"
.Pp
Your system is now complete, and it is up to you to configure the rest.
You may want to start by looking at
.Pa /etc/rc.conf .
.Pp
Once you are done with the rest of configuration unmount your file
systems and halt your system, then reboot:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "cd /"
.Dl # Ic "umount -av"
.Dl # Ic "halt"
.Pp
Finally you can now boot your system and it will be completely
functional:
.Pp
.Dl Ic "netbsd"
.Pp
When it boots off of the hard drive, you will have a complete
.Nx
system!
.Em Congratulations!
(You really deserve them!!!)
