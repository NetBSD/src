.Nx \*V
runs on any Amiga that has a 68020 or better CPU with
some form of MMU, and on 68060 DraCos.
.Pp
.Nx
does not, and will never, run on run on
A1000, A500, A600, A1200, A2000, A4000/EC030, CDTV and CD32
systems that are not enhanced by a CPU board.
.Pp
For 68020 and 68030 systems, a FPU is recommended but not required for the
system utilities.
68LC040, 68040V and 68LC060 systems don't work correctly at the moment.
.Pp
The minimal configuration requires around 24 MB of RAM (not including CHIPMEM!)
and about 250 MB of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space,
and to run X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.
(24 MB of RAM will actually allow you to compile,
however it won't be speedy.
X really isn't usable on a 24 MB system.)
.Pp
You will probably want to compile your own kernel.
.Li GENERIC
is large and bulky in order to accommodate all people.
For example, most people's machines have an FPU, so you do not need the
bulky FPU_EMULATE option.
.Pp
If you have less than 8 MB of fast memory, you should make your swap
partition large, as your system will be a lot of swapping.
In addition, do
.Em not
place your swap partition onto a old small (and normally slow) disk!

SCSI scanner support is machine independent, so it should
work, but hasn't been tested on most Amiga configurations.
There are reports that the Mustek and HP ScanJet hang if
accessed from the A3000.
This might apply to other 33C93-Adapters, too.

Your floppy will stay unchanged, but you might not notice that
you didn't write anything due to the buffer cache.
Also note that HD floppy drives only get detected as such if a
