.Nx \*V
runs on any Amiga that has a 68020 or better CPU with
some form of MMU, and on 68060 DraCos.
.Pp
.Nx
does not, and will never, run on run on
A1000, A500, A600, A1200, A2000, A4000/EC030, CDTV and CD32
systems that are not enhanced by a CPU board.
.Pp
For 68020 and 68030 systems, a FPU is recommended but not required for the
system utilities.
68LC040, 68040V and 68LC060 systems don't work correctly at the moment.
.Pp
The minimal configuration requires 6 MB of RAM (not including CHIPMEM!)
and about 75 MB of disk space.  To install the entire system requires
much more disk space, and to run X or compile the system, more RAM
is recommended.  (6 MB of RAM will actually allow you to compile,
however it won't be speedy. X really isn't usable on a 6 MB system.)
.Pp
Here is a table of recommended HD partition sizes for a full install:
.Bl -column -offset indent Partition Suggested 100xMBxx Needed 100xMB
.It Partition Ta Suggested Ta +\ X     Ta Needed   Ta +\ X
.It /\ (root) Ta "25 MB"   Ta "25 MB"  Ta "20 MB"  Ta "20 MB"
.It /usr      Ta "245 MB"  Ta "270 MB" Ta "120 MB" Ta "145 MB"
.It /var      Ta "20 MB"   Ta "20 MB"  Ta "5 MB"   Ta "5 MB"
.It swap      Ta Em "2*RAM below 32 MB, then up to you"
.El
.(item -offset indent
Anything else is up to you!
.item)
.Pp
As you may note the recommended size of
.Pa /usr
is 125 MB greater than needed.
This is to leave room for a kernel source and compile tree as
you will probably want to compile your own kernel.
.Li GENERIC
is large and bulky to accommodate all people.
For example, most people's machines have an FPU, so you do not need the
bulky FPU_EMULATE option.
.Pp
Preconfigured or precompiled packages are installed below
.Pa /usr/pkg
by default.
You should either make
.Pa /usr
larger (if you intend to install a lot of them), make
.Pa /usr/pkg
an additional partition, use the
.Fl p
option to
.Ic pkg_add
to install them in a different place, or link
.Pa /usr/pkg
to a different place.
.Pp
If you only have less than 8 MB of fast memory, you should make your swap
partition larger, as your system will be doing much more swapping.
Especially: do
.Em not
place it onto a old small (and normally slow) disk!

SCSI scanner support is machine independent, so it should
work, but hasn't been tested yet on most Amiga configurations.
There are reports that the Mustek and HP ScanJet hang if
accessed from the A3000. This might apply to other
33C93-Adapters, too.

Our floppy driver doesn't notice when mounted floppies are
write-protected at the moment. Your floppy will stay
unchanged, but you might not notice that you didn't write
anything due to the buffer cache. Also note that HD floppy
drives only get detected as such if a HD floppy is inserted at
boot time.
