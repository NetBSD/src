NetBSD/amiga 1.2 runs on any Amiga that has a 68020 or better CPU with
some form of FPU and MMU, and on DraCos.

The minimal configuration requires 4M of RAM and about 75M of disk
space.  To install the entire system requires much more disk space,
and to run X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  (4M of
RAM will actually allow you to compile, however it won't be speedy. X
really isn't usable on a 4M system.)

Here is a table of recommended HD partition sizes for a full install:
	partition:	advise,	with X,	needed,	with X
	root (/)	20M	20M	15M	15M
	user (/usr)	80M	110M	60M 	90M
	swap		----- 2M for every M ram -----
	local (/local)	up to you


As you may note the recommended size of /usr is 20M greater than
needed. This is to leave room for a kernel source and compile tree as
you will probably want to compile your own kernel. (GENERIC is large
and bulky to accommodate all people).

If you only have 4M of fast memory, you should make your swap partition
larger, as your system will be doing much more swapping.

If its not on the above lists, there is no support for it in this
release. Especially (but this is an incomplete list), there is no
driver for:

	Cyberstorm SCSI option, Blizzard IV SCSI, Blizzard 2060 SCSI,
	Ferret SCSI, Oktagon SCSI, CyberVision64/3D.

Known problems with some hardware:

	*) the Emplant SCSI adapter has been reported by a party to
	hang after doing part of the installation without problems.

	**) Fastlane SCSI is reported to show data errors and hangs at
	least when used with multiple devices on the bus. This might
	be a problem with any FAS board. 

	***) SCSI scanner support is machine independent, so it should
	work, but hasn't been tested yet on most Amiga configurations.
	There are reports that the Mustek and HP Scanjet hang if
	accessed from the A3000. This might apply to other
	33C93-Adapters, too.

	****) Our floppy driver doesn't notice when mounted floppies are 
	write-protected at the moment. Your floppy will stay
	unchanged, but you might not notice that you didn't write
	anything due to the buffer cache. Also note that HD floppy
	drives only get detected as such if a HD floppy is inserted at
	boot time.
