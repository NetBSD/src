.Nx \*V
runs on any Amiga that has a 68020 or better CPU with
some form of MMU, and on 68060 DraCos.
.Pp
For 68020 and 68030 systems, a FPU is recommended but not required for the
system utilities.
68LC040, 68040V and 68LC060 systems don't work correctly at the moment.
.Pp
The minimal configuration requires 6M of RAM (not including CHIPMEM!)
and about 75M of disk space.  To install the entire system requires
much more disk space, and to run X or compile the system, more RAM
is recommended.  (6M of RAM will actually allow you to compile,
however it won't be speedy. X really isn't usable on a 6M system.)
.Pp
Here is a table of recommended HD partition sizes for a full install:
.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
partition:	advise,	with X,	needed,	with X
root (/)	20M	20M	15M	15M
user (/usr)	110M	135M	90M 	115M
swap		----- 2M for every M ram -----
local (/usr/local)	up to you
.Ed
.
.Pp
As you may note the recommended size of /usr is 20M greater than
needed. This is to leave room for a kernel source and compile tree as
you will probably want to compile your own kernel. GENERIC is large
and bulky to accommodate all people. For example, most peoples machines
have an FPU, so you do not need the bulky FPU_EMULATE option.
.Pp
Preconfigured or precompiled packages are installed below /usr/pkg per
default. You should either make /usr larger (if you intend to install
a lot of them), make /usr/pkg an additional partiton, use the -p option
to pkg_add to install them in a different place or link /usr/pkg to
some different place.
.Pp
If you only have less than 8M of fast memory, you should make your swap
partition larger, as your system will be doing much more swapping. Especially:
do NOT place it onto a old small (and normally slow) disk!

drivers for: Blizzard III SCSI option,

Footnotes: Known problems with some hardware:
.Bl -tag -width *****
.It *
the Emplant SCSI adapter has been reported by a party to
hang after doing part of the installation without problems.
.It **
SCSI scanner support is machine independent, so it should
work, but hasn't been tested yet on most Amiga configurations.
There are reports that the Mustek and HP Scanjet hang if
accessed from the A3000. This might apply to other
33C93-Adapters, too.
.It ****
Our floppy driver doesn't notice when mounted floppies are 
write-protected at the moment. Your floppy will stay
unchanged, but you might not notice that you didn't write
anything due to the buffer cache. Also note that HD floppy
drives only get detected as such if a HD floppy is inserted at
boot time.
.It *****
No X11 server available.
