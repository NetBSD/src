Installation is supported from several media types, including:
.Bl -bullet
.It
AmigaDOS HD partitions
.It
Tape
.It
NFS partitions
.It
FTP
.It
NetBSD partitions, if doing an upgrade.
.It
CD-ROM (SCSI or ATAPI)
.El
.Pp
The miniroot file system needs to be transferred to the NetBSD swap
partition.  This can be done from AmigaDOS in the case of a new
install or upgrade, or from NetBSD when doing an upgrade.  See the
"Preparing your System for NetBSD Installation" section for details.
.Pp
The steps necessary to prepare the distribution sets
for installation depend on which method of installation
you choose.  The various methods are explained below.
.Bl -bullet
.It
To prepare for installing via an AmigaDOS partition:
.Pp
To install NetBSD from an AmigaDOS partition, you need to
get the NetBSD distribution sets you wish to install
on your system on to an AmigaDOS partition.  All of the
set_name.xx pieces can be placed in a single directory
instead of separate ones for each distribution set.  This
will also simplify the installation work later on.
.Pp
Note where you place the files you will need this later.
.Pp
Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next
step in the installation process, preparing your hard disk.
.It
To prepare for installing from CD-ROM:
.Pp
To install NetBSD from a CD-ROM drive, make sure it is a SCSI
CD-ROM on a SCSI bus currently supported by NetBSD (refer to the
supported hardware list) or an ATAPI cd-rom connected to the A1200
or A4000 internal IDE connector. If it is a
SCSI CD-ROM on a non-supported SCSI bus like 
Blizzard-3 SCSI, Apollo SCSI) you must first copy the distribution
sets to an AmigaDOS partition like described above.
.Pp
If your SCSI CD-ROM is connected to a supported SCSI host adapter,
or it is an ATAPI cd-rom connected to the A1200/A4000 internal IDE connector,
simply put the CD into the drive before installation.
.Pp
Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next
step in the installation process, preparing your hard disk.
.It
To prepare for installing via a tape:
.Pp
To install NetBSD from a tape, you need to somehow
get the NetBSD file sets you wish to install on
your system on to the appropriate kind of tape.
.Pp
If you're making the tape on a UN*X system, the easiest
way to do so is:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dd if=\*<first file\*> of=\*<tape device\*>
dd if=\*<2nd file\*> of=\*<tape device\*>
\&...
.Ed
.Pp
where "\*<tape_device\*>" is the name of the non-rewinding tape
device that describes the tape drive you're using (possibly
something like /dev/nrst0, but we make no guarantees 8-).
If you can't figure it out, ask your system administrator.
"\*<files\*>" are the names of the "set_name.tgz" files
which you want to be placed on the tape.
.Pp
If you have a slow cpu (e.g. 68030 @ 25 MHz) on the target
machine, but big tapes, you might want to store the
uncompressed installation sets instead.  This will help tape
streaming when doing the actual installation. E.g, do:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
gzip -d -c \*<first file\*> | dd of=\*<tape device\*>
gzip -d -c \*<2nd file\*> | dd of=\*<tape device\*>
\&...
.Ed
Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next
step in the installation process, preparing your hard disk.
.It
To prepare for installing via an NFS partition:
.(tag Em Note:
this method of installation is recommended
only for those already familiar with using
the BSD network-manipulation commands and
interfaces.  If you aren't, this documentation
should help, but is not intended to be
all-encompassing.
.tag)
.Pp
Place the NetBSD software you wish to install into
a directory on an NFS server, and make that directory
mountable by the machine which you will be installing
NetBSD on.  This will probably require modifying the
/etc/exports file of the NFS server and resetting
mountd, acts which will require superuser privileges.
Note the numeric IP address of the NFS server and of
the router closest to the new NetBSD machine,
if the NFS server is not on a network which is
directly attached to the NetBSD machine.
.Pp
Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next
step in the installation process, preparing your hard disk.
.It
To prepare for installing via FTP:
.(tag Em Note:
this method of installation is recommended
only for those already familiar with using
the BSD network-manipulation commands and
interfaces.  If you aren't, this documentation
should help, but is not intended to be
all-encompassing.
.tag)
.Pp
The preparations for this method of installation
are easy: all you have to do is make sure that
there's some FTP site from which you can retrieve
the NetBSD installation when it's time to do
the install.  You should know the numeric IP
address of that site, the numeric IP address of
your nearest router if one is necessary
.Pp
Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next
step in the installation process, preparing your hard disk.
.It
If you are upgrading NetBSD, you also have the option of installing
NetBSD by putting the new distribution sets somewhere in your existing
file system, and using them from there.  To do that, you must do the
following:
.Pp
Place the distribution sets you wish to upgrade somewhere in
your current file system tree.  At a bare minimum, you must
upgrade the "base" binary distribution, and so must put the
"base" set somewhere in your file system.  If you wish,
you can do the other sets, as well, but you should NOT upgrade
the "etc" distribution; the "etc" distribution contains system
configuration files that you should review and update by hand.
.Pp
Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next step in
the upgrade process, actually upgrading your system.
