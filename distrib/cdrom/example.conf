# The ports for which the base OS binaries will be included.
# MACHINE_ARCH shared distribution directories and the "ALL" shared
# distribution directory are added automatically where needed.
#
# The following ports, if included, will be bootable on their respective
# CD images:
#
#     alpha, i386, macppc, pmax, sparc, sparc64, sun3, vax.
#
# Special notes on booting:
#
# * macppc and mac68k will cause the inclusion of HFS partition and
#   filesystem info on the CD, with automatic MacBinary probing and encoding.
#
# * alpha and macppc cannot boot on the same disc.  This will cause a warning
#   in the build, and macppc will override.  This will be fixed by a better
#   installboot for alpha in the future.
#
# * macppc and vax cannot boot on the same disc.  These platforms use the
#   same locations in block 0 to store boot information.  This will cause a
#   warning in the build, and macppc will override.
#
# * sparc64 cannot boot using default boot arguments on the same disc as
#   the sun3x model of sun3.  These platforms use the same partitions
#   in the Sun boot map by default.  This will cause a warning in the build,
#   and sparc64 machines will have to boot with "boot cdrom:g" instead of
#   "boot cdrom".

# Independent ports:

# These provide additional functionality to some host OS's that may or may

# USE_ROCK_RIDGE adds -r to mkisofs to use full Un*x style pathnames and
# permissions.  For most situations, this is needed.

USE_ROCK_RIDGE=	yes

# USE_LONG_NAMES adds -l to mkisofs to use full 32-character ISO-9660 names.
# This allows some host OS's, particularly AmigaDOS, the ability to see long
# filenames in most cases.

USE_LONG_NAMES=	yes

# USE_TRANS_TBL adds -T to mkisofs to provide long names through the use of
# TRANS.TBL translation table files.  (These will automatically be hidden
# from Joliet and HFS trees.)  Typically this is not used in conjunction
# with USE_LONG_NAMES, but may be used if names still exceed 32 characters.

#USE_TRANS_TBL=	yes

# USE_JOLIET adds -J to mkisofs to provide Joliet long filename support for
# Microsoft Windows OS's

USE_JOLIET=	yes

# USE_APPLE_ISO adds -apple to mkisofs to provide the Apple ISO-9660
# Extensions.  This gives full MacOS attribute information to files without
# the overhead of full HFS.  (A disc that is forced into HFS mode by the
# presence of mac68k or macppc will use HFS, not the Apple ISO Extensions.)

USE_APPLE_ISO=	yes

# LOG_MKISOFS causes the mkisofs command to be logged in "extra verbose"
# mode (-v -v) to the image filename with .log appended.
