# Usage: regpkgset [options] set
#
# Options:
#   -q		Quiet.
#   -v		Verbose.
#   -f		Force.
#   -m		Ignore errors from missing files.
#   -u		Update.
#   -c		Cache some information in ${BUILD_INFO_CACHE}.
#   -d destdir	Sets DESTDIR.
#   -t binpkgdir Create a binary package (in *.tgz format) in the
#		specified directory.  Without this option, a binary
#		package is not created.
#   -M metalog	Use the specified metalog file to override file
#		or directory attributes when creating a binary package.
#   -N etcdir	Use the specified directory for passwd and group files.
