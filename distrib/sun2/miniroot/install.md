Here is an example of what the partition information will look like once
you have entered the disklabel editor. Disk partition sizes and offsets
are in sector (most likely 512 bytes) units. Make sure all partitions
start on a cylinder boundary (c/t/s == XXX/0/0).

[Example]
partition      start         (c/t/s)      nblks         (c/t/s)  type

 a (root)          0       (0/00/00)      31392     (109/00/00)  4.2BSD
 b (swap)      31392     (109/00/00)      73440     (255/00/00)  swap
 c (disk)          0       (0/00/00)    1070496    (3717/00/00)  unused
 d (user)     104832     (364/00/00)      30528     (106/00/00)  4.2BSD
 e (user)     135360     (470/00/00)      40896     (142/00/00)  4.2BSD
 f (user)     176256     (612/00/00)      92160     (320/00/00)  4.2BSD
 g (user)     268416     (932/00/00)     802080    (2785/00/00)  4.2BSD

This program is designed to help you put NetBSD on your disk,
in a simple and rational way.  You'll be asked several questions,
and it would probably be useful to have your disk's hardware
manual, the installation notes, and a calculator handy.
__welcome_banner_1

	else
		echo ""
		echo "Welcome to the NetBSD/sun2 ${VERSION} upgrade program."
		cat << \__welcome_banner_2

This program is designed to help you upgrade your NetBSD system in a
simple and rational way.

As a reminder, installing the 'etc' binary set is NOT recommended.
Once the rest of your system has been upgraded, you should manually
merge any changes to files in the 'etc' set into those files which
already exist on your system.

cat << \__welcome_banner_3

As with anything which modifies your disk's contents, this
program can cause SIGNIFICANT data loss, and you are advised
to make sure your data is backed up before beginning the
installation process.

Default answers are displayed in brackets after the questions.
You can hit Control-C at any time to quit, but if you do so at a
prompt, you may have to hit return.  Also, quitting in the middle of
installation may leave your system in an inconsistent state.

md_not_going_to_install() {

OK, then.  Enter 'halt' at the prompt to halt the machine.  Once the
machine has halted, power-cycle the system to load new boot code.

CONGRATULATIONS!  You have successfully $what NetBSD!
To boot the installed system, enter halt at the command prompt. Once the
system has halted, reset the machine and boot from the disk.
