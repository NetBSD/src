# ramdisk/list - packing list for the ramdisk.
#
# The ramdisk root has to stay small enough so the kernel
# can be loaded in less than one megabyte of ram, including
# uninitialized data (bss).  Otherwise it will not work on
# the Sun2/50.  This is not too hard, because the ONLY
# tools needed in this root are those that one might use
# to initialize the disk label and copy a miniroot image
# into the swap partition.  Everything else is done after
# the machine is rebooted from the miniroot.
#
# Note that the "ln" directives below are not really about
# filesystem links, but rather the ability of the resulting
# crunched binary to select the right program when argv[0]
# matches the names on right of the "ln prog" directive.
# For example, the shell can be run with argv[0]="-sh"
# (login shell convention) but no such file will exist.
# Similarly, one may want to run "init" as "oinit"...
#
# Notes about what is included (or not) and why:
#
# Include mknod incase I forgot some device nodes...
# Support copying miniroot from NFS, TFTP, or CDROM.
# Need mount_ffs, mount_ufs to remount the ramdisk.
#
# Might use cat to look at files (it's small anyway).
# Need for copying miniroot from tape: dd, mt
# Keep to allow minor fixes: ln, mkdir, mv
# Small and handy: cat, echo, pwd, sync
#
# Note: ssh has no "if", so "test" is useless.  Also,
# left out: cp, chmod, rm.  The ramdisk does not really
# need them, and they pull in fts_* from libc.
#
# Might use these to get the miniroot: rsh, tftp
#
# Assume gunzip can run elsewhere, i.e.:
#   rsh gzcat sun2.miniroot.gz
# No need to extract archives either...
