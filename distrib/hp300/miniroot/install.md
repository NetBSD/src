You will need to provide some information about your disk's geometry.
Geometry info for SCSI disks was printed at boot time.  If that information
is not available, use the information provided in your disk's manual.
Please note that the geometry printed at boot time is preferred.

IMPORTANT NOTE: due to a limitation in the disklabel(8) program, the
number of cylinders on the disk will be increased by 1 so that the initial
label can be placed on disk for editing.  When the disklabel editor appears,
make absolutely certain you subtract 1 from the total number of cylinders,
and adjust the size of partition 'c' such that:

	size = (sectors per track) * (tracks per cyl) * (total cylinders)

Note that the disklabel editor will be run twice; once to set the size of
partition 'c' and correct the geometry, and again so that you may correctly
edit the partition map.  This is to work around the afore mentioned
limitation in disklabel(8).  Apologies offered in advance.

This program is designed to help you install NetBSD on your system in a
simple and rational way.  You'll be asked several questions, and it would
probably be useful to have your disk's hardware manual, the installation
notes, and a calculator handy.

In particular, you will need to know some reasonably detailed
information about your disk's geometry.  This program can determine
some limited information about certain specific types of HP-IB disks.
If you have SCSI disks, however, prior knowledge of disk geometry
is absolutely essential.  The kernel will attempt to display geometry
information for SCSI disks during boot, if possible.  If you did not
make it note of it before, you may wish to reboot and jot down your
disk's geometry before proceeding.

As with anything which modifies your hard disk's contents, this
program can cause SIGNIFICANT data loss, and you are advised
to make sure your hard drive is backed up before beginning the
installation process.

Default answers are displyed in brackets after the questions.
You can hit Control-C at any time to quit, but if you do so at a
prompt, you may have to hit return.  Also, quitting in the middle of
installation may leave your system in an inconsistent state.
