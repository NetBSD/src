$NetBSD: README,v 1.4 2002/09/13 19:07:01 thorpej Exp $

Special notes for cross-hosting a NetBSD build on certain platforms.  
Only those platforms which have been tested to complete a "build.sh" run
are listed.

=====

LINUX:

* Tested on RedHat Linux 7.1 (i386).

* The gcc (and libstdc++, if needed) package must be installed, along
  with the typical system development packages (glibc-devel, etc.).

* The ncurses-devel package must be installed (for nbinfo).

* The zlib and zlib-devel packages must be installed.  This will be
  fixed in the future to include zlib in libnbcompat.

=====

NETBSD (earlier releases):

* Tested on NetBSD 1.5.2 (machine-independently).

* Should need no special setup.

=====

SOLARIS:

* Tested on Solaris/x86 8 (5.8) with gcc 2.95.2 and Solaris/sparc 8 (5.8)
  with gcc 3.2 (not yet tested with SUNWspro).

* $HOST_CC needs to be set properly (for gcc, it should be set to "gcc",
  otherwise the improper /usr/ucb/cc may be invoked by accident).

* The SUNWzlib package (or a built version of zlib visible to $HOST_CC,
  such as SMCzlib from sunfreeware.com) must be installed.  This will be
  fixed in the future to include zlib in libnbcompat.

* Needs the following paths, in this order, in $PATH:

      /usr/ccs/bin
      <path to host C and C++ compilers>
      /usr/bin

  /usr/ucb may optionally be placed before /usr/bin, per your preference,
  but /usr/ucb *MUST NOT* be before /usr/ccs/bin or before the path to
  the host C and C++ compilers.

  Also note that /usr/xpg4/bin *MUST NOT* be in the path before /usr/bin.
  /usr/xpg4/bin/sh is a symbolic link to /usr/bin/ksh, which has different
  semantics for "pwd" than /usr/bin/sh.  Since nbmake uses /bin/sh (which
  is a symbolic link to /usr/bin/sh), the different semantics break obj
  directories in the presence of symbolic links, especially if using NFS.
