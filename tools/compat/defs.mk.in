# Makefile fragment for building with libnbcompat and associated
# include files.  It can also be used for building just with
# the include files, without the library.
#
# This can be used when the library and include files have been installed
# into TOOLDIR (by "make install" in the src/tools/compat directory),
# or when they have not been installed into TOOLDIR but reside
# in the .OBJDIR associated with src/tools/compat.
#
# Variables:
#
# COMPATLIB_UNINSTALLED:
#		If "yes", then use the files from the .OBJDIR of
#		NETBSDSRCDIR/tools/compat.  Otherwise, use the files
#		from TOOLDIR.
#
# COMPATLIB_NO_LIB:
#		If "yes" then do not use the library (but still use
#		the include files).
#
# Examples:
#
# * Use uninstalled copy of libnbcompat and associated *.h files:
#
#	COMPATLIB_UNINSTALLED= yes
#	COMPATOBJ!=	cd ${NETBSDSRCDIR}/tools/compat && ${PRINTOBJDIR}
#	.-include	"${COMPATOBJ}/defs.mk"
#
# * Use TOOLDIR copy of libnbcompat and associated *.h files:
#
#	.-include	"${TOOLDIR}/share/compat/defs.mk"
#
# * Use TOOLDIR copy of compat *.h files, but do not use libnbcompat.a:
#
#	COMPATLIB_NO_LIB= yes
#	.-include	"${TOOLDIR}/share/compat/defs.mk"
#
# The use of ".-include" instead of ".include" above is because it's
# expected that the file might not exist during "make obj" or "make clean".
#
