Firmware images for Broadcom Fullmac are available from the linux-firmware
repository:

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/

It is always preferable to use firmware and configs from mainline Linux.

When importing from linux-firmware, use vendor tag "LINUX" and release
tag that's the name of the linux-firmware shapshot you're importing,
e.g. "linux-firmware-20200316".


There are some cases where the required files are not available from
mainline linux-firmware.  In these cases, different vendor / release
tags should be used for these specific files.  These special cases
are listed here.

Pinebook Pro "bwfm" firmware
============================
These firmware images come from Tobias Schramm's pinebook-firmware
repository:

  https://gitlab.manjaro.org/tsys/pinebook-firmware/-/tree/master/brcm

When importing from this repository, use vendor tag "tsys-pinebook-firmware"
and a release tag "commit-SHA" where SHA is the Git commit identifier.

This applies to the following files:

	dist/brcmfmac43456-sdio.bin
	dist/brcmfmac43456-sdio.clm_blob
	dist/brcmfmac43456-sdio.pine64,pinebook-pro.txt

Note that in the pinebook-firmware repository, the file
brcmfmac43456-sdio.pine64,pinebook-pro.txt is a symbolic link to
brcmfmac43456-sdio.txt.
