.Sh NAME
.Nm sqlite3_blob_bytes
.Nd return the size of an open BLOB
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sqlite3.h
.Ft int
.Fo sqlite3_blob_bytes
.Fa "sqlite3_blob *"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Returns the size in bytes of the BLOB accessible via the successfully
opened BLOB handle in its only argument.
The incremental blob I/O routines can only read or overwriting existing
blob content; they cannot change the size of a blob.
.Pp
This routine only works on a BLOB handle which has been
created by a prior successful call to
.Fn sqlite3_blob_open
and which has not been closed by
.Fn sqlite3_blob_close .
Passing any other pointer in to this routine results in undefined and
probably undesirable behavior.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
These declarations were extracted from the
interface documentation at line 7716.
