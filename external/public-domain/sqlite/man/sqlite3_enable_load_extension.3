.Sh DESCRIPTION
So as not to open security holes in older applications that are unprepared
to deal with extension loading, and as a means of
disabling extension loading while evaluating user-entered
SQL, the following API is provided to turn the sqlite3_load_extension()
mechanism on and off.
.Pp
Extension loading is off by default.
Call the sqlite3_enable_load_extension() routine with onoff==1 to turn
extension loading on and call it with onoff==0 to turn it back off
again.
