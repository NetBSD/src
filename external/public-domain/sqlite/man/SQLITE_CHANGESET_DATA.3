.Sh DESCRIPTION
Values that may be passed as the second argument to a conflict-handler.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It SQLITE_CHANGESET_DATA
The conflict handler is invoked with CHANGESET_DATA as the second argument
when processing a DELETE or UPDATE change if a row with the required
PRIMARY KEY fields is present in the database, but one or more other
(non primary-key) fields modified by the update do not contain the
expected "before" values.
.Pp
The conflicting row, in this case, is the database row with the matching
primary key.
.It SQLITE_CHANGESET_NOTFOUND
The conflict handler is invoked with CHANGESET_NOTFOUND as the second
argument when processing a DELETE or UPDATE change if a row with the
required PRIMARY KEY fields is not present in the database.
.Pp
There is no conflicting row in this case.
The results of invoking the sqlite3changeset_conflict() API are undefined.
.It SQLITE_CHANGESET_CONFLICT
CHANGESET_CONFLICT is passed as the second argument to the conflict
handler while processing an INSERT change if the operation would result
in duplicate primary key values.
.Pp
The conflicting row in this case is the database row with the matching
primary key.
.It SQLITE_CHANGESET_FOREIGN_KEY
If foreign key handling is enabled, and applying a changeset leaves
the database in a state containing foreign key violations, the conflict
handler is invoked with CHANGESET_FOREIGN_KEY as the second argument
exactly once before the changeset is committed.
If the conflict handler returns CHANGESET_OMIT, the changes, including
those that caused the foreign key constraint violation, are committed.
Or, if it returns CHANGESET_ABORT, the changeset is rolled back.
.Pp
No current or conflicting row information is provided.
The only function it is possible to call on the supplied sqlite3_changeset_iter
handle is sqlite3changeset_fk_conflicts().
.It SQLITE_CHANGESET_CONSTRAINT
If any other constraint violation occurs while applying a change (i.e.
a UNIQUE, CHECK or NOT NULL constraint), the conflict handler is invoked
with CHANGESET_CONSTRAINT as the second argument.
.Pp
There is no conflicting row in this case.
The results of invoking the sqlite3changeset_conflict() API are undefined.
