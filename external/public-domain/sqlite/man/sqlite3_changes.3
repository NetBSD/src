.Nd Count The Number Of Rows Modified
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ft int 
.Fo sqlite3_changes
.Fa "sqlite3*"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This function returns the number of database rows that were changed
or inserted or deleted by the most recently completed SQL statement
on the database connection specified by the first
parameter.
Only changes that are directly specified by the INSERT, UPDATE,
or DELETE statement are counted.
Auxiliary changes caused by triggers or foreign key actions
are not counted.
Use the sqlite3_total_changes() function to
find the total number of changes including changes caused by triggers
and foreign key actions.
.Pp
Changes to a view that are simulated by an INSTEAD OF trigger
are not counted.
Only real table changes are counted.
.Pp
A "row change" is a change to a single row of a single table caused
by an INSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE statement.
Rows that are changed as side effects of REPLACE constraint
resolution, rollback, ABORT processing, DROP TABLE, or by
any other mechanisms do not count as direct row changes.
.Pp
A "trigger context" is a scope of execution that begins and ends with
the script of a  trigger.
Most SQL statements are evaluated outside of any trigger.
This is the "top level" trigger context.
If a trigger fires from the top level, a new trigger context is entered
for the duration of that one trigger.
Subtriggers create subcontexts for their duration.
.Pp
Calling sqlite3_exec() or sqlite3_step()
recursively does not create a new trigger context.
.Pp
This function returns the number of direct row changes in the most
recent INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement within the same trigger
context.
.Pp
Thus, when called from the top level, this function returns the number
of changes in the most recent INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE that also occurred
at the top level.
Within the body of a trigger, the sqlite3_changes() interface can be
called to find the number of changes in the most recently completed
INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement within the body of the same trigger.
However, the number returned does not include changes caused by subtriggers
since those have their own context.
.Pp
See also the sqlite3_total_changes() interface,
the count_changes pragma, and the changes() SQL function.
.Pp
If a separate thread makes changes on the same database connection
while sqlite3_changes() is running then the value
returned is unpredictable and not meaningful.
