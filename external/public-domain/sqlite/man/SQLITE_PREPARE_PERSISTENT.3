.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #define SQLITE_PREPARE_PERSISTENT
.Fd #define SQLITE_PREPARE_NORMALIZE
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These constants define various flags that can be passed into "prepFlags"
parameter of the sqlite3_prepare_v3() and sqlite3_prepare16_v3()
interfaces.
.Pp
New flags may be added in future releases of SQLite.

.It SQLITE_PREPARE_PERSISTENT
The SQLITE_PREPARE_PERSISTENT flag is a hint to the query planner that
the prepared statement will be retained for a long time and probably
reused many times.
Without this flag, sqlite3_prepare_v3() and sqlite3_prepare16_v3()
assume that the prepared statement will be used just once or at most
a few times and then destroyed using sqlite3_finalize()
relatively soon.
The current implementation acts on this hint by avoiding the use of
lookaside memory so as not to deplete the limited store
of lookaside memory.
Future versions of SQLite may act on this hint differently.
.It SQLITE_PREPARE_NORMALIZE
The SQLITE_PREPARE_NORMALIZE flag indicates that a normalized representation
of the SQL statement should be calculated and then associated with
the prepared statement, which can be obtained via the sqlite3_normalized_sql()
interface.
The semantics used to normalize a SQL statement are unspecified and
subject to change.
At a minimum, literal values will be replaced with suitable placeholders.
