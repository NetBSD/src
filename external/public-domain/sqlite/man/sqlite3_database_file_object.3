.Sh DESCRIPTION
If X is the name of a rollback or WAL-mode journal file that is passed
into the xOpen method of sqlite3_vfs, then sqlite3_database_file_object(X)
returns a pointer to the sqlite3_file object that represents
the main database file.
.Pp
This routine is intended for use in custom VFS implementations only.
It is not a general-purpose interface.
The argument sqlite3_file_object(X) must be a filename pointer that
has been passed into sqlite3_vfs.xOpen method where the
flags parameter to xOpen contains one of the bits SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_JOURNAL
or SQLITE_OPEN_WAL.
Any other use of this routine results in undefined and probably undesirable
behavior.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
These declarations were extracted from the
interface documentation at line 3857.
