.Sh DESCRIPTION
These macros define the various options to the
.Fn sqlite3_vtab_config
interface that virtual table implementations can use to
customize and optimize their behavior.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It SQLITE_VTAB_CONSTRAINT_SUPPORT
Calls of the form sqlite3_vtab_config(db,SQLITE_VTAB_CONSTRAINT_SUPPORT,X)
are supported, where X is an integer.
If X is zero, then the virtual table whose xCreate
or xConnect method invoked
.Fn sqlite3_vtab_config
does not support constraints.
In this configuration (which is the default) if a call to the xUpdate
method returns SQLITE_CONSTRAINT, then the entire
statement is rolled back as if OR ABORT had been specified
as part of the users SQL statement, regardless of the actual ON CONFLICT
mode specified.
.Pp
If X is non-zero, then the virtual table implementation guarantees
that if xUpdate returns SQLITE_CONSTRAINT,
it will do so before any modifications to internal or persistent data
structures have been made.
If the ON CONFLICT mode is ABORT, FAIL, IGNORE or ROLLBACK,
SQLite is able to roll back a statement or database transaction, and
abandon or continue processing the current SQL statement as appropriate.
If the ON CONFLICT mode is REPLACE and the xUpdate method returns
SQLITE_CONSTRAINT, SQLite handles this as if the ON
CONFLICT mode had been ABORT.
.Pp
Virtual table implementations that are required to handle OR REPLACE
must do so within the xUpdate method.
If a call to the
.Fn sqlite3_vtab_on_conflict
function indicates that the current ON CONFLICT policy is REPLACE,
the virtual table implementation should silently replace the appropriate
rows within the xUpdate callback and return SQLITE_OK.
Or, if this is not possible, it may return SQLITE_CONSTRAINT, in which
case SQLite falls back to OR ABORT constraint handling.
.It SQLITE_VTAB_DIRECTONLY
Calls of the form sqlite3_vtab_config(db,SQLITE_VTAB_DIRECTONLY)
from within the the xConnect or xCreate methods of a
virtual table implementation prohibits that virtual table
from being used from within triggers and views.
.It SQLITE_VTAB_INNOCUOUS
Calls of the form sqlite3_vtab_config(db,SQLITE_VTAB_INNOCUOUS)
from within the the xConnect or xCreate methods of a
virtual table implementation identify that virtual table
as being safe to use from within triggers and views.
Conceptually, the SQLITE_VTAB_INNOCUOUS tag means that the virtual
table can do no serious harm even if it is controlled by a malicious
hacker.
Developers should avoid setting the SQLITE_VTAB_INNOCUOUS flag unless
absolutely necessary.
.It SQLITE_VTAB_USES_ALL_SCHEMAS
Calls of the form sqlite3_vtab_config(db,SQLITE_VTAB_USES_ALL_SCHEMA)
from within the the xConnect or xCreate methods of a
virtual table implementation instruct the query planner
to begin at least a read transaction on all schemas ("main", "temp",
and any ATTACH-ed databases) whenever the virtual table is used.
