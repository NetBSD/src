.Fd #define SQLITE_SCANSTAT_NVISIT

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The following constants can be used for the T parameter to the sqlite3_stmt_scanstatus(S,X,T,V)
interface.
Each constant designates a different metric for sqlite3_stmt_scanstatus()
to return.
.Pp
When the value returned to V is a string, space to hold that string
is managed by the prepared statement S and will be automatically freed
when S is finalized.
.Pp
Not all values are available for all query elements.
When a value is not available, the output variable is set to -1 if
the value is numeric, or to NULL if it is a string (SQLITE_SCANSTAT_NAME).

.It SQLITE_SCANSTAT_NLOOP
The sqlite3_int64 variable pointed to by the V parameter
will be set to the total number of times that the X-th loop has run.
.It SQLITE_SCANSTAT_NVISIT
The sqlite3_int64 variable pointed to by the V parameter
will be set to the total number of rows examined by all iterations
of the X-th loop.
.It SQLITE_SCANSTAT_EST
The "double" variable pointed to by the V parameter will be set to
the query planner's estimate for the average number of rows output
from each iteration of the X-th loop.
If the query planner's estimates was accurate, then this value will
approximate the quotient NVISIT/NLOOP and the product of this value
for all prior loops with the same SELECTID will be the NLOOP value
for the current loop.
.It SQLITE_SCANSTAT_NAME
The "const char *" variable pointed to by the V parameter will be set
to a zero-terminated UTF-8 string containing the name of the index
or table used for the X-th loop.
.It SQLITE_SCANSTAT_EXPLAIN
The "const char *" variable pointed to by the V parameter will be set
to a zero-terminated UTF-8 string containing the EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
description for the X-th loop.
.It SQLITE_SCANSTAT_SELECTID
The "int" variable pointed to by the V parameter will be set to the
id for the X-th query plan element.
The id value is unique within the statement.
The select-id is the same value as is output in the first column of
an EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN query.
.It SQLITE_SCANSTAT_PARENTID
The "int" variable pointed to by the V parameter will be set to the
the id of the parent of the current query element, if applicable, or
to zero if the query element has no parent.
This is the same value as returned in the second column of an EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
query.
.It SQLITE_SCANSTAT_NCYCLE
The sqlite3_int64 output value is set to the number of cycles, according
to the processor time-stamp counter, that elapsed while the query element
was being processed.
This value is not available for all query elements - if it is unavailable
the output variable is set to -1.
