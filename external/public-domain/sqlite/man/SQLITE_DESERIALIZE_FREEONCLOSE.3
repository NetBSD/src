.Nd Flags for sqlite3_deserialize()
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #define SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_FREEONCLOSE
.Fd #define SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_RESIZEABLE
.Fd #define SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_READONLY
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The following are allowed values for 6th argument (the F argument)
to the sqlite3_deserialize(D,S,P,N,M,F)
interface.
.Pp
The SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_FREEONCLOSE means that the database serialization
in the P argument is held in memory obtained from sqlite3_malloc64()
and that SQLite should take ownership of this memory and automatically
free it when it has finished using it.
Without this flag, the caller is responsible for freeing any dynamically
allocated memory.
.Pp
The SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_RESIZEABLE flag means that SQLite is allowed
to grow the size of the database using calls to sqlite3_realloc64().
This flag should only be used if SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_FREEONCLOSE is
also used.
Without this flag, the deserialized database cannot increase in size
beyond the number of bytes specified by the M parameter.
.Pp
The SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_READONLY flag means that the deserialized database
should be treated as read-only.
