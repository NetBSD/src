.Sh DESCRIPTION
Closes an open BLOB handle.
.Pp
Closing a BLOB shall cause the current transaction to commit if there
are no other BLOBs, no pending prepared statements, and the database
connection is in autocommit mode.
If any writes were made to the BLOB, they might be held in cache until
the close operation if they will fit.
.Pp
Closing the BLOB often forces the changes out to disk and so if any
I/O errors occur, they will likely occur at the time when the BLOB
is closed.
Any errors that occur during closing are reported as a non-zero return
value.
.Pp
The BLOB is closed unconditionally.
Even if this routine returns an error code, the BLOB is still closed.
.Pp
Calling this routine with a null pointer (such as would be returned
by a failed call to sqlite3_blob_open()) is a harmless
no-op.
