.In sqlite3.h

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The sqlite3_trace_v2(D,M,X,P) interface registers a trace callback
function X against database connection D, using
property mask M and context pointer P.
If the X callback is NULL or if the M mask is zero, then tracing is
disabled.
The M argument should be the bitwise OR-ed combination of zero or more
SQLITE_TRACE constants.
.Pp
Each call to either sqlite3_trace(D,X,P) or sqlite3_trace_v2(D,M,X,P)
overrides (cancels) all prior calls to sqlite3_trace(D,X,P) or sqlite3_trace_v2(D,M,X,P)
for the database connection D.
Each database connection may have at most one trace callback.
.Pp
The X callback is invoked whenever any of the events identified by
mask M occur.
The integer return value from the callback is currently ignored, though
this may change in future releases.
Callback implementations should return zero to ensure future compatibility.
.Pp
A trace callback is invoked with four arguments: callback(T,C,P,X).
The T argument is one of the SQLITE_TRACE constants to
indicate why the callback was invoked.
The C argument is a copy of the context pointer.
The P and X arguments are pointers whose meanings depend on T.
.Pp
The sqlite3_trace_v2() interface is intended to replace the legacy
interfaces
.Fn sqlite3_trace
and
.Fn sqlite3_profile ,
both of which are deprecated.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
These declarations were extracted from the
interface documentation at line 3383.
