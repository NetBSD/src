.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sqlite3_log
.Nd error logging interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sqlite3.h
.Ft void
.Fo sqlite3_log
.Fa "int iErrCode"
.Fa "const char *zFormat"
.Fa "..."
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn sqlite3_log
interface writes a message into the error log established
by the SQLITE_CONFIG_LOG option to
.Fn sqlite3_config .
If logging is enabled, the zFormat string and subsequent arguments
are used with
.Fn sqlite3_snprintf
to generate the final output string.
.Pp
The sqlite3_log() interface is intended for use by extensions such
as virtual tables, collating functions, and SQL functions.
While there is nothing to prevent an application from calling sqlite3_log(),
doing so is considered bad form.
.Pp
The zFormat string must not be NULL.
.Pp
To avoid deadlocks and other threading problems, the sqlite3_log()
routine will not use dynamically allocated memory.
The log message is stored in a fixed-length buffer on the stack.
If the log message is longer than a few hundred characters, it will
be truncated to the length of the buffer.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
These declarations were extracted from the
interface documentation at line 9377.
