.Sh NAME
.Nm sqlite3
.Nd database connection handle
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sqlite3.h
.Vt typedef struct sqlite3 sqlite3;
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Each open SQLite database is represented by a pointer to an instance
of the opaque structure named "sqlite3".
It is useful to think of an sqlite3 pointer as an object.
The
.Fn sqlite3_open ,
.Fn sqlite3_open16 ,
and
.Fn sqlite3_open_v2
interfaces are its constructors, and
.Fn sqlite3_close
and
.Fn sqlite3_close_v2
are its destructors.
There are many other interfaces (such as
.Fn sqlite3_prepare_v2 ,
.Fn sqlite3_create_function ,
and
.Fn sqlite3_busy_timeout
to name but three) that are methods on an sqlite3 object.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
These declarations were extracted from the
interface documentation at line 259.
