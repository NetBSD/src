.Sh DESCRIPTION
This interface is used to retrieve runtime status information about
the performance of SQLite, and optionally to reset various highwater
marks.
The first argument is an integer code for the specific parameter to
measure.
Recognized integer codes are of the form  SQLITE_STATUS_....
The current value of the parameter is returned into *pCurrent.
The highest recorded value is returned in *pHighwater.
If the resetFlag is true, then the highest record value is reset after
*pHighwater is written.
Some parameters do not record the highest value.
For those parameters nothing is written into *pHighwater and the resetFlag
is ignored.
Other parameters record only the highwater mark and not the current
value.
For these latter parameters nothing is written into *pCurrent.
.Pp
The sqlite3_status() routine returns SQLITE_OK on success and a non-zero
error code on failure.
.Pp
This routine is threadsafe but is not atomic.
This routine can be called while other threads are running the same
or different SQLite interfaces.
However the values returned in *pCurrent and *pHighwater reflect the
status of SQLite at different points in time and it is possible that
another thread might change the parameter in between the times when
*pCurrent and *pHighwater are written.
