.Sh DESCRIPTION
This routine sets a busy handler that sleeps for a specified
amount of time when a table is locked.
The handler will sleep multiple times until at least "ms" milliseconds
of sleeping have accumulated.
After at least "ms" milliseconds of sleeping, the handler returns 0
which causes
.Fn sqlite3_step
to return SQLITE_BUSY.
.Pp
Calling this routine with an argument less than or equal to zero turns
off all busy handlers.
.Pp
There can only be a single busy handler for a particular database connection
at any given moment.
If another busy handler was defined  (using
.Fn sqlite3_busy_handler )
prior to calling this routine, that other busy handler is cleared.
