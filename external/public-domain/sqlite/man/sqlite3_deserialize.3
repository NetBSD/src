.Sh DESCRIPTION
The sqlite3_deserialize(D,S,P,N,M,F) interface causes the database connection
D to disconnect from database S and then reopen S as an in-memory database
based on the serialization contained in P.
The serialized database P is N bytes in size.
M is the size of the buffer P, which might be larger than N.
If M is larger than N, and the SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_READONLY bit is not
set in F, then SQLite is permitted to add content to the in-memory
database as long as the total size does not exceed M bytes.
.Pp
If the SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_FREEONCLOSE bit is set in F, then SQLite
will invoke sqlite3_free() on the serialization buffer when the database
connection closes.
If the SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_RESIZEABLE bit is set, then SQLite will try
to increase the buffer size using sqlite3_realloc64() if writes on
the database cause it to grow larger than M bytes.
.Pp
The sqlite3_deserialize() interface will fail with SQLITE_BUSY if the
database is currently in a read transaction or is involved in a backup
operation.
.Pp
If sqlite3_deserialize(D,S,P,N,M,F) fails for any reason and if the
SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_FREEONCLOSE bit is set in argument F, then sqlite3_free()
is invoked on argument P prior to returning.
.Pp
This interface is only available if SQLite is compiled with the SQLITE_ENABLE_DESERIALIZE
option.
