.Sh DESCRIPTION
This routine enables or disables the sharing of the database cache
and schema data structures between  connections to the
same database.
Sharing is enabled if the argument is true and disabled if the argument
is false.
.Pp
Cache sharing is enabled and disabled for an entire process.
This is a change as of SQLite version 3.5.0.
In prior versions of SQLite, sharing was enabled or disabled for each
thread separately.
.Pp
The cache sharing mode set by this interface effects all subsequent
calls to sqlite3_open(), sqlite3_open_v2(),
and sqlite3_open16().
Existing database connections continue use the sharing mode that was
in effect at the time they were opened.
.Pp
This routine returns SQLITE_OK if shared cache was enabled
or disabled successfully.
An error code is returned otherwise.
.Pp
Shared cache is disabled by default.
But this might change in future releases of SQLite.
Applications that care about shared cache setting should set it explicitly.
.Pp
This interface is threadsafe on processors where writing a 32-bit integer
is atomic.
