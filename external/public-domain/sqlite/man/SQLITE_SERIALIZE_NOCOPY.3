.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #define SQLITE_SERIALIZE_NOCOPY
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Zero or more of the following constants can be OR-ed together for the
F argument to sqlite3_serialize(D,S,P,F).
.Pp
SQLITE_SERIALIZE_NOCOPY means that sqlite3_serialize()
will return a pointer to contiguous in-memory database that it is currently
using, without making a copy of the database.
If SQLite is not currently using a contiguous in-memory database, then
this option causes sqlite3_serialize() to return
a NULL pointer.
SQLite will only be using a contiguous in-memory database if it has
been initialized by a prior call to sqlite3_deserialize().
