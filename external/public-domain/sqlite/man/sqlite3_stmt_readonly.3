.Sh DESCRIPTION
The sqlite3_stmt_readonly(X) interface returns true (non-zero) if and
only if the prepared statement X makes no direct
changes to the content of the database file.
.Pp
Note that application-defined SQL functions
or virtual tables might change the database indirectly
as a side effect.
For example, if an application defines a function "eval()" that calls
.Fn sqlite3_exec ,
then the following SQL statement would change the database file through
side-effects:
.Bd -ragged
.Bd -literal
SELECT eval('DELETE FROM t1') FROM t2;

.Pp
But because the SELECT statement does not change the database
file directly, sqlite3_stmt_readonly() would still return true.
.Pp
Transaction control statements such as BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK,
SAVEPOINT, and RELEASE cause sqlite3_stmt_readonly()
to return true, since the statements themselves do not actually modify
the database but rather they control the timing of when other statements
modify the database.
The ATTACH and DETACH statements also cause sqlite3_stmt_readonly()
to return true since, while those statements change the configuration
of a database connection, they do not make changes to the content of
the database files on disk.
The sqlite3_stmt_readonly() interface returns true for BEGIN since
BEGIN merely sets internal flags, but the BEGIN IMMEDIATE
and BEGIN EXCLUSIVE commands do touch the database and
so sqlite3_stmt_readonly() returns false for those commands.
.Pp
This routine returns false if there is any possibility that the statement
might change the database file.
A false return does not guarantee that the statement will change the
database file.
For example, an UPDATE statement might have a WHERE clause that makes
it a no-op, but the sqlite3_stmt_readonly() result would still be false.
Similarly, a CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS statement is a read-only no-op
if the table already exists, but sqlite3_stmt_readonly() still returns
false for such a statement.
.Pp
If prepared statement X is an EXPLAIN or EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
statement, then sqlite3_stmt_readonly(X) returns the same value as
if the EXPLAIN or EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN prefix were omitted.
