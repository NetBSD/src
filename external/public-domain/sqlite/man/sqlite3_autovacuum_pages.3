.Sh DESCRIPTION
The sqlite3_autovacuum_pages(D,C,P,X) interface registers a callback
function C that is invoked prior to each autovacuum of the database
file.
The callback is passed a copy of the generic data pointer (P), the
schema-name of the attached database that is being autovacuumed, the
size of the database file in pages, the number of free pages, and the
number of bytes per page, respectively.
The callback should return the number of free pages that should be
removed by the autovacuum.
If the callback returns zero, then no autovacuum happens.
If the value returned is greater than or equal to the number of free
pages, then a complete autovacuum happens.
.Pp
If there are multiple ATTACH-ed database files that are being modified
as part of a transaction commit, then the autovacuum pages callback
is invoked separately for each file.
.Pp
\fBThe callback is not reentrant.\fP The callback function should not attempt
to invoke any other SQLite interface.
If it does, bad things may happen, including segmentation faults and
corrupt database files.
The callback function should be a simple function that does some arithmetic
on its input parameters and returns a result.
.Pp
The X parameter to sqlite3_autovacuum_pages(D,C,P,X) is an optional
destructor for the P parameter.
If X is not NULL, then X(P) is invoked whenever the database connection
closes or when the callback is overwritten by another invocation of
sqlite3_autovacuum_pages().
.Pp
There is only one autovacuum pages callback per database connection.
Each call to the sqlite3_autovacuum_pages() interface overrides all
previous invocations for that database connection.
If the callback argument (C) to sqlite3_autovacuum_pages(D,C,P,X) is
a NULL pointer, then the autovacuum steps callback is cancelled.
The return value from sqlite3_autovacuum_pages() is normally SQLITE_OK,
but might be some other error code if something goes wrong.
The current implementation will only return SQLITE_OK or SQLITE_MISUSE,
but other return codes might be added in future releases.
.Pp
If no autovacuum pages callback is specified (the usual case) or a
NULL pointer is provided for the callback, then the default behavior
is to vacuum all free pages.
So, in other words, the default behavior is the same as if the callback
function were something like this:
