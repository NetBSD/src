.Nd Total Number Of Rows Modified
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ft int 
.Fo sqlite3_total_changes
.Fa "sqlite3*"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This function returns the total number of rows inserted, modified or
deleted by all INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statements
completed since the database connection was opened, including those
executed as part of trigger programs.
Executing any other type of SQL statement does not affect the value
returned by sqlite3_total_changes().
.Pp
Changes made as part of foreign key actions are
included in the count, but those made as part of REPLACE constraint
resolution are not.
Changes to a view that are intercepted by INSTEAD OF triggers are not
counted.
.Pp
This the sqlite3_total_changes(D) interface
only reports the number of rows that changed due to SQL statement run
against database connection D.
Any changes by other database connections are ignored.
To detect changes against a database file from other database connections
use the PRAGMA data_version command or the SQLITE_FCNTL_DATA_VERSION
file control.
.Pp
If a separate thread makes changes on the same database connection
while sqlite3_total_changes() is running then
the value returned is unpredictable and not meaningful.
