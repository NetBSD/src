.Sh DESCRIPTION
The sqlite3_release_memory() interface attempts to free N bytes of
heap memory by deallocating non-essential memory allocations held by
the database library.
Memory used to cache database pages to improve performance is an example
of non-essential memory.
sqlite3_release_memory() returns the number of bytes actually freed,
which might be more or less than the amount requested.
The sqlite3_release_memory() routine is a no-op returning zero if SQLite
is not compiled with SQLITE_ENABLE_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.
