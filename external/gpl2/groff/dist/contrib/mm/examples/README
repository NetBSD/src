This directory contains examples of my enhancements to MM.

APP		The appendix macro
B1B2		Box macro with text
COVER		My general cover macro, this example is using
		ms.cov.
IND		A general indexing method, see manual for INITI
LT		The letter macro
LT.se		A swedish example with the extra
		swedish macros for getting a letter conforming
		to swedish standard letter, both left and right adjusted.
ML		Marked list, an extended list type
MOVE		The MOVE macro, how to begin to print on an exact position.
MUL		Enhanced multicolumn mode.
NCOL		Start on next column. (Not for MUL*)
ND		New date, with iso date example
References	How to use references
SETR		General reference system, see manual for INITR


Examples that I should have:

PIC		How to include postscript pictures, see manual for PIC
VERBON		Begin verbatim output


And remember, check the manual for all string and number registers,
I've made shure that mgm will be useful in several languages
and all english output can be redefined.
Check the manual for groff_mse (swedish format) and the
macro file, tmac.mse.
