This is mgm, a macro package for groff.

It is supposed to be compatible with the DWB mm macros,
and has several extensions.

Send bug reports to jh@axis.com with a description of the problem
and a sample of text which reproduces the error.

Don't forget to mention the version of mgm (look in the beginning
of m.tmac) and the version of groff.

Any new ideas or improvements are welcome.

Newest version is available here or at the groff CVS repository.
ftp://ftp.axis.se/pub/groff/mm<something>.gz

You can install mgm as a separate package without the configure in groff
with the following command:

make -f Makefile.sim install

This README should be bigger :-)

Thanks to everyone who have sent me bug-reports and fixes.
