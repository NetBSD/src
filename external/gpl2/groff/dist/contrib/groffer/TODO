File position: <groff-source>/contrib/groffer/TODO


####### TODO

Revision:

Optimization:
- Optimize `man' path determination in manpath_add_lang_sys() for speed
  by building-up the `man' path only by and by as far as necessary
  (not trivial).
- To increase the running speed write part of the `groffer' shell
  script in C/C++.

Features of external programs:
- Revise option handling of `grog'.

Documentation:
- Improve the documentation of the search algorithm for `man' pages in
  both the `groffer' scripts and the `man' page `groffer.man'.
- In `groffer.man', add more documentation for parts that were taken
  over from GNU `man'.
- The documentation in the headers for some function definitions in
  `groffer2.sh' needs to be updated.
