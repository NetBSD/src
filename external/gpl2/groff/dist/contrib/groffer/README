README

The `groffer' program is the easiest way to read documents written in
some `roff' language, such as the `man pages', the manual pages in
many operating systems.


Input

Input comes from either standard input or command line parameters that
represent names of exisiting roff files or standardized specifications
for searching man pages.  All of these can be compressed in a format
that is decompressible by `gzip', including `.gz', `bz2', and `.Z'.

`groffer' has many built-in `man' functionalities to find and read the
manual pages on UNIX and similar operating systems.  It accepts the
information from an installed `man' program, but tries to find a man
path by itself.

`groffer' bundles all filespec parameters into a single output file in
the same way as `groff'.  The disadvantage of this is that all file
name arguments must use the same groff language.  To change this, the
option parsing must be revised for large parts.  It seems that this
would create incompatibilities, so the actual option strategy is kept.


Output

All input is first sent to `grog' to determine the necessary `groff'
options and then to `groff'.  So no special `groff' arguments must be
given.  But all `groff' options can be specified when this seems to be
appropriate.

The following displaying modes for the output are available:
- Display formatted input with
-- the X `roff' viewer `gxditview',
-- a Postcript viewer,
-- a PDF viewer,
-- a DVI viewer,
-- a web browser,
-- a pager in a text terminal (tty).
- Generate `groff' output on stdout without a viewer.
- Generate the `groff intermediate output' on standard output without
  postprocessing.
- Output the source code without any `groff' processing.
- There are some information outputs without `groff' processing, such
  as by option `-V' and the `man' like `whatis' and `apropos'
  outputs.

By default, the program tries to display with `gxditview' as graphical
device in X; on non-X text terminals, the `tty' text mode with a pager
is tried by default.


Compatibility

`groffer' consists of two shell scripts.  It should run on any POSIX
or Bourne style shell that supports shell functions.  See file
`README_SH' for more information.


Mailing lists

For reporting bugs of `groffer', groff's free mailing list
<bug-groff@gnu.org> can be used.

For a general discussion, the mailing list <groff@gnu.org> is more
useful, but one has to subscribe to this list at
http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/groff.

See the `README' file in the top directory of the `groff' source
package for more details on these mailing lists.
