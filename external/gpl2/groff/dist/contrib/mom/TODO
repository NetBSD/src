As of version 1.2, the items on this TODO list will only be dealt
with if users request they be implemented.

UNDERLINING
-----------
Explore "the ultimative underline macro" for possible inclusion
into mom.

NUMBERED HEADS, SUBHEADS and PARAHEADS
--------------------------------------
Macros to set numbering style (roman, arabic, alpha, etc)?

FOOTNOTES
---------
In columnar docs, maybe give user the choice of gathering all
footnotes at the bottom of the last column?

CONTROL MACROS -- _INDENT
--------------
Let user be able to enter decimal fractions as the argument to _INDENT
control macros, or, instead, let user be able to enter absolute
values with a unit of measure in addition to current behaviour,
which is relative.
