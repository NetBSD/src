========================================================================

Version 1.3
===========

Persistent error in html coding of docs (<nobr> tag).
---Fixed---

Version 1.2-f
============

Multiple line subheads near page bottom sometimes printing one line
of subhead at page bottom, and subsequent lines on next page.
---Fixed---

Post-quote spacing still wonky when paragraph spacing is turned on.
---Fixed--- (for good would be nice)

RULE not always resetting quad and quad value.
---Fixed---

Version 1.2-e
=============

Some string definitions in om.tmac had superfluous spaces after
them (e.g. $COVERTITLE).
---Fixed---

Spacing under quotes not correct when paragraph spacing is turned
on.
---Fixed---


First word of last line before footnotes is getting chopped.
---Fixed---

Version 1.2-d
=============

HEADER_FAMILY not changing header family.
---Fixed---

FAMILY, after COLLATE, not changing the family of all and every
page element or tag.
---Fixed---

Heads and subheads at the start of docs are printing one line lower
than they should.
---Fixed---
 
Gaps are appearing at the bottom of pages when there's a linebreak
followed by a subhead.
---Fixed---

When LS is invoked after a single text line at the top of a page
containing a T_MARGIN (set with T_MARGIN or PAGE), mom is performing
spacing adjustments as if the first line doesn't exist.
---Fixed---

Changes made to ALD and LS in version 1.2-c should not apply when
the document processing macros are used.  There is a significant
conflict with the internal use of ALD when the docheader is only
one line long (as, for example, when DOCTYPE is CHAPTER).
---Fixed, pending discovery of further conflicts---

Version 1.2-c
=============

Deferred footnotes not always being output, and groff complains
"ending diversion FN_OVERFLOW on exit."
---Fixed---

First .LS call after a top margin has been set (with .T_MARGIN
or .PAGE) causing mom to move off the top margin baseline.  Also,
there are conflicts between ALD, LS and T_MARGIN.
---Fixed---

DROPCAP not properly restoring a running \*[COND] or \*[EXT] after
COND or EXT are given as arguments to DROPCAP.
---Fixed---

Version 1.2
===========

.PAD not co-operating with mom's fontstyles, esp. when a full
family+fontstyle is given to .FT.
---Fixed---

.DROPCAP -- ditto the above.
---Fixed---

Version 1.1.9
=============

Footnote markers not resetting properly on new pages when COLUMNS
is enabled.
---Fixed---

When overflowed footnote material is the only footnote material on
the page or in the column, no footnotes are output.
---Fixed---

The AUTOLEAD used in FOOTNOTE not being disabled after FOOTNOTES
are output, or after PROCESS_FN_LEFTOVER/PROCESS_FN_IN_DIVER.
---Fixed---

COL_NEXT and COL_BREAK, when invoked during the last column on a
page, are overprinting the last column instead of breaking to a new
page when there are footnotes in the column.
---Fixed---

BR_AT_LINE_KERN not "break-and-spreading" text when used in
justified copy.
---Fixed---

Version 1.1.8
=============

BLOCKQUOTE_FAMILY not changing blockquote family.
---Fixed---

FOOTNOTE, whether in column mode or not, was using
#FN_COUNT_FOR_COLS for all footnote markers and handling.
---Fixed---

Deferred footnotes that occured on the second to last page of
documents not printing.
---Fixed---

Version 1.1.7-a
===============

Suite number in DOCTYPE LETTER not printing.
---Fixed---

Footer elements not always vertically aligning.
---Fixed---

Footer rule gap not always correctly observed.
---Fixed---

Page numbering, when at top of page, not always falling on
HDRFTR_MARGIN.
---Fixed---

Default page numbering style for COPYSTYLE draft is DIGIT instead
of roman.
---Fixed---

Hyphens around page numbering when style is DIGIT, ROMAN or ALPHA
not vertically centered.
---Fixed---

EXT arg not working with DROPCAP.
---Fixed---

DOC_QUAD not automatically set immediately after START
---Fixed--

Tabs behaving erratically during document processing.
---Fixed---

Version 1.1.7
=============

When DOCHEADER OFF <distance> is given, if <distance> falls short
of the top margin of running text, <distance> is not respected and
bottom margin falls low.
---Fixed---


Version 1.1.6-e
===============

The " mark (doublequote), when entered while not in document
processing mode (i.e. just straightforward typesetting), outputs
nothing unless SMARTQUOTES is invoked explicitly.
---Fixed---

Version 1.1.6-c
===============

In document processing mode, docs that use *none* of the
docprocessing tags being ignored.
---Fixed---

Version 1.1.6-b
===============

String tabs not picking up #L_MARGIN when #L_MARGIN not explicitly
set with L_MARGIN, PAPER or PAGE.
---Fixed---

Infinite loop when B_MARGIN is set lower than FOOTER_MARGIN during
doc processing.
---Fixed---

Version 1.1.6-a
===============

Mom partially broken when run with groff 1.19.1.  Don't know yet
what this is, whether bad coding in mom, or a problem with 1.19.1.
Only solution for now: run mom 1.1.6 with groff 1.18.
----Fixed---

Top margin of endnotes pages after the first endnotes page when
PRINTSTYLE is TYPEWRITE and endnotes single-spacing is turned on
falling one line too high.
---Fixed---

Version 1.1.6
=============

DOCHEADER OFF (distance) not being respected.
---Fixed---

FINIS killing ENDNOTES page numbering and heads.
---Fixed---

Version 1.1.5
=============

Pad not working properly and/or spitting out warnings when fill mode is
on.
---Fixed---

Version 1.1.2
=============

PAGENUM_STYLE being ignored unless entered after START.
---Fixed---

Version 1.1
===========

String tabs not working as advertised when set from within other tabs.
---Fixed---

.COLLATE sometimes depositing a header on the first page of a subsequent doc.
---Fixed with workaround BREAK_QUOTE---

.UNDERLINE_QUOTES in PRINTSTYLE TYPEWRITE not on by default as advertised.
---Fixed---

.TI not cooperating with other indent styles.
---Fixed---

.WS and .SS not cooperating.
---Fixed---

.RW and .EW not working.
---Fixed---

========================================================================

KNOWN PROBLEMS
--------------

The indent macros from the typesetting macro set may not always
perform well in conjunction with the document processing macros,
especially when documents are set in columns.  Mostly, this is the
result of inadequate testing.  There are only so many "who'd want to
do this anyway?" scenarios I can think of on my own.

Epigraphs at the bottoms of page may sometimes run exactly one line
deeper than they should.  The alternative (from my point of view) is
to have them run 1 line shorter than they should.  The problem stems
from the fact the epigraphs are leaded differently than all other text,
and there's only so much adjusting that can be done with the whitespace
surrounding them to get them to bottom align.  Since stylistically,
epigraphs should never appear at the bottom of a page/column without at
least some running text beneath them in order to make sense of the role
they play in page layout, this not likely to be fixed for some time.
