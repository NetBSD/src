This is a preview release of a proposed pdfmark.tmac macro package,
for use with GNU troff (groff).  It is not yet complete, and should
be considered as an alpha release;  there are a few problems to be
resolved (see file PROBLEMS).

Partial documentation is provided, in groff-ms format.  To convert
this to PDF format, you will require a working groff installation,
a working ghostscript installation, with the gs command in your PATH,
and a GNU-compatible make.  The tarball should be unpacked in the
top directory of your groff source tree, then:

  cd <groff-current>/contrib/pdfmark
  make pdfmark

where <groff-current> is the top directory of your current groff
source tree.

Included in this package, are:

  pdfmark.tmac -- the core pdfmark macro set
  spdf.tmac    -- a rudimentary set of bindings for ms macros
  pdfmark.ms   -- preliminary documentation
  cover.ms     -- a template for the documentation cover sheet
  gnu.eps      -- the groff logo, copied from the groff distribution
  Makefile     -- makefile, for formatting the documentation
  README       -- this file
  PROBLEMS     -- a list of known problems
  TODO         -- a list of planned features, not yet implemented

To make the pdfmark macros generally usable, copy pdfmark.tmac to the
'site-tmac' directory appropriate to your groff installation; (ms users
may also wish to copy spdf.tmac).  The macros may then be accessed, by
including the '-mpdfmark' option on the groff command line; (for ms
users, '-mspdf' is equivalent to '-ms -mpdfmark', with some extra
macros 'thrown in').

Comments, and bug reports are welcomed.  Please post to the groff
mailing list, groff@gnu.org; (you must be subscribed to this list to
