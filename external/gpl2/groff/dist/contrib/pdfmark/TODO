TODO items for pdfmark.tmac
===========================

Add copyright information to PDF documentation.

--------

Add acknowledgements and trade mark ownership notifications
to PDF documentation.

--------

Provide documentation in man page and texinfo formats.

--------

Add comments in spdf.tmac, to clarify its operation.
Also add commentary in pdfmark.tmac, to clarify operation of
recent changes.

--------

Make Makefile generic, so 'configure' can resolve target
system dependencies.

If this refers to contrib/pdfmark/Makefile, then it is addressed by the new
`pdfroff' script; the original Makefile may be considered redundant.  Local
system dependencies are resolved by `configure', and applied to `pdfroff',
when it is generated from `pdfroff.sh'.

--------

Improve Makefile.sub, to integrate pdfmark.tmac installation
into a regular groff build.  Add it to groff's Makefile.in.

Completed.

--------

Provide a `pdfmark' script (or call it `groff2pdf'?) which
actually converts a groff input file to pdf, and which
takes care of the necessary intermediate steps to handle
PDF marks.

* Comment added 2005-02-26 by Keith Marshall <keith.d.marshall@ntlworld.com>

This facility now provided by `pdfroff' script; documented in `pdfroff.man'.
Man page still requires an additional section, to describe use of `stylesheet'
feature.  Script also requires documentation in PDF and texinfo formats.
