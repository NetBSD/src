This is gxditview, an X11 previewer for groff based on MIT's xditview.
This version can be used with the output of gtroff -Tps as well as
with -TX75 and -TX100.  You will need X11R5 or newer to install it (it
might work on X11R4, but I haven't tested it.)

Previously, gxditview was installed in the usual place for X binaries
(e.g., /usr/bin/X11); you have to remove it manually.

xditview is copyrighted by MIT under the usual X terms (see
gxditview.man); the changes to that which come along with the groff package
are in the public domain.

Please report bugs to bug-groff@gnu.org.
