This manual documents @code{send-pr}, 
@ifinfo
version @value{VERSION},
@end ifinfo
which uses electronic mail to submit support questions and problem
reports to a central Support Site.  No body of work is perfect, and
support organizations understand this; @code{send-pr} is designed to
allow users who have problems to submit reports of these problems to
sites responsible for supporting the products in question, in a defined
form which can be read by an electronically managed database.

@cindex GNATS
@code{send-pr} is part of a suite of programs known collectively as
@sc{gnats}, the @sc{gnu} Problem Report Management System.  @sc{gnats}
consists of several programs which, used in concert, formulate and
partially administer a database of @dfn{Problem Reports}, or @dfn{PRs},
at a central Support Site.  A PR goes through several states in its
lifetime; @sc{gnats} tracks the PR and all information associated with it
through each state and finally acts as an archive for PRs which have
been @dfn{closed}.

Because @code{send-pr} exists as a shell (@file{/bin/sh}) script and as
an Elisp file for use with @sc{gnu} Emacs, it can be used from any
machine on your network which can run a shell script and/or Emacs.

In general, you can use any editor and mailer to submit valid Problem
Reports, as long as the format required by @sc{gnats} is preserved.
@code{send-pr} automates the process, however, and ensures that certain
fields necessary for automatic processing are present.  @code{send-pr}
is strongly recommended for all initial problem-oriented correspondence
with your Support Site.  The organization you submit Problem Reports to
supplies an address to which further information can be sent; the person
responsible for the category of the problem you report contacts you
directly.

@cindex Problem Reports
A @dfn{Problem Report} is a message that describes a problem you are
having with a body of work.  @code{send-pr} organizes this message into
a form which can be understood and automatically processed by @sc{gnats},
the @sc{gnu} Problem Report Management System.  A Problem Report is
organized into @dfn{fields} which contain data describing you, your
organization, and the problem you are announcing (@pxref{Fields,,Problem
Report format}).  Problem Reports go through several defined states in
their lifetimes, from @dfn{open} to @dfn{closed} (@pxref{States,,States
of Problem Reports}).

Cygnus Support in Mountain View, CA, uses @sc{gnats} and @code{send-pr}
extensively for their support activities.  As a support company, Cygnus
finds problem tracking to be a crucial part of everyday business.
Cygnus supports the @sc{gnu} compiling tools (including @sc{gnats} and
@code{send-pr}) over several many platforms

With each shipment of the Cygnus Support Developer's Kit, customers
receive the latest version of @code{send-pr}, which contains an
up-to-date listing of valid categories (values for the @code{>Category:}
field).  Using these tools, Cygnus' customers can communicate their
problems to Cygnus effectively and receive automatic confirmation of
receipt as well as notification of changes in the status of their
reported problems.  Much of Cygnus' support mechanism relies on
electronic mail.

As an example, let's pretend we're a customer of Cygnus Support, and
that we're having a problem compiling some of our software using the
@sc{gnu} C compiler, which Cygnus supports.

Assume that we're getting an error in our @code{bifrabulator} program
wherein the @samp{prestidigitation} routines don't match with the
@samp{whatsitsname}.  We've made sure we're following the rules of the
program and checked the Release Notes from Cygnus and found that the bug
isn't already known.  In other words, we're pretty sure we've found a
bug.

@cindex Imaginary Software, Ltd.
Our first step is to call @code{send-pr}.  It really doesn't matter
whether we use @code{send-pr} from the shell or from within Emacs.
Indeed, if we use Emacs as a primary editor, calling @code{send-pr} from
the shell is likely to start @code{send-pr} in an Emacs buffer anyway.
So, since our company, @emph{Imaginary Software, Ltd.}, uses @sc{gnu}
software extensively, we're pretty familiar with Emacs, so from within
Emacs we type
@smallexample
M-x send-pr
@end smallexample

and we're greeted with the following screen:

We know from past experience that we need to set certain information into
each field, so we compile all the information we know about our problem.
We have some sample code which we know should work, even though it
doesn't, so we'll include that.  Below is the completed PR; we send this
using @kbd{C-c C-c}.  (The comments have been truncated).

Got your message, Jeff.  It seems that the bifrabulator was 
confusing the prestidigitation routines with the realitychecker
when lexically parsing the whatsitsname.

I'm working on robustisizing the bifrabulator now.

How about lunch next week?

If you receive @code{send-pr} as part of a larger software distribution,
it probably gets installed when the full distribution is installed.  If
you are using @sc{gnats} at your site as well, you must decide where
@code{send-pr} sends Problem Reports by default; see @ref{default site,,
Setting a default @var{site}}.

@menu

@node installation
@section Installing @code{send-pr} by itself
@cindex installation procedure

Install @code{send-pr} by following these steps (you may need
@code{root} access in order to change the @file{aliases} file and to
install @code{send-pr}):

@itemize @bullet
@item
Unpack the distribution into a directory which we refer to as
@var{srcdir}.

@item
Edit the file @file{Makefile} to reflect local conventions.
Specifically, you should edit the variable @samp{prefix} to alter the
installation location.  The default is @file{/usr/local}.  All files are
installed under @samp{prefix} (see below).

@item @emph{Run}
@smallexample
make all install [ info ] [ install-info ] [ clean ]
@end smallexample

@noindent
The targets mean the following:

@table @code
@item all
Builds @code{send-pr} and @code{install-sid}

@item install
Installs the following:

@table @code
@item install-sid
@itemx send-pr
into @file{@var{prefix}/bin}

@item send-pr.1
into @file{@var{prefix}/man/man1}

@item @var{site}
the list of valid @var{categories} for the Support Site from which you
received @code{send-pr}, installed as
@w{@file{@var{prefix}/lib/gnats/@var{site}}}

@item send-pr.el
into @w{@file{@var{prefix}/lib/emacs/lisp}}@footnote{If your main Emacs
lisp repository is in a different directory from this, substitute that
directory for @w{@file{@var{prefix}/lib/emacs/lisp}}.}
@end table

@item info (@emph{optional})
Builds @file{send-pr.info} from @file{send-pr.texi}@*
@c FIXME - is this still true?
(@file{send-pr.info} is included with this distribution)

@item install-info (@emph{optional})
Installs @file{send-pr.info} into @w{@file{@var{prefix}/info}}

@item clean (@emph{optional})
Removes all intermediary build files that can be rebuilt from source
code
@end table

@item
Run

@smallexample
install-sid @var{your-sid}
@end smallexample

@noindent
where @var{your-sid} is the identification code you received with
@w{@code{send-pr}}.  @code{send-pr} automatically inserts this value
into the template field @samp{>Submitter-Id:}.  If you've downloaded
@code{send-pr} from the Net, use @samp{net} for this value.

@item 
Place the following line in
@w{@file{@var{prefix}/lib/emacs/lisp/default.el}}, or instruct your
users to place the following line in their @file{.emacs} files:

@smallexample
(autoload 'send-pr "send-pr" "Submit a Problem Report." t)
@end smallexample

@item 
Create a mail alias for the Support Site from which you received
@code{send-pr}, and for every site with which you wish to use
@code{send-pr} to communicate.  Each alias must have a suffix of
@samp{-gnats}.  The Support Site(s) will provide the correct addresses
where these aliases should point.  For instance, edit your mail aliases
file to contain something like:

@smallexample
# support sites; for use with send-pr
cygnus-gnats:     bugs@@cygnus.com            # Cygnus Support
bumblebee-gnats:  bumblebugs@@bumblebee.com   # Bumblebee Inc.
mycompany-gnats:  bugs@@my.company.com (@emph{if you use @sc{gnats} locally})
@end smallexample

@code{send-pr} automatically searches for these aliases when you type

@smallexample
send-pr cygnus
send-pr bumblebee
send-pr @var{site}@dots{}
@end smallexample

@noindent
@code{send-pr} also uses @var{site} to determine the categories of
problems accepted by the site in question by looking in

@smallexample
@var{prefix}/lib/gnats/@var{site}
@end smallexample

@end itemize

@node default site
@section Setting a default @var{site}
@cindex default @var{site}
@cindex setting a default @var{site}

@code{send-pr} is capable of sending Problem Reports to any number of
Support Sites, using mail aliases which have @samp{-gnats} appended them.
@code{send-pr} automatically appends the suffix, so that when you type

@smallexample
send-pr @var{site}
@end smallexample

@noindent
the Problem Report goes to the address noted in the @file{aliases} file
as @w{@samp{@var{site}-gnats}}.  You can do this in the Emacs version of
@code{send-pr} by invoking the program with

@smallexample
C-u M-x send-pr
@end smallexample

@noindent
You are prompted for @var{site}.

@var{site} is also used to error-check the @samp{>Category:} field, as a
precaution against sending mistaken information (and against sending
information to the wrong site).

You may also simply type

@smallexample
send-pr
@end smallexample

@noindent
from the shell (or @w{@samp{M-x send-pr}} in Emacs), and the Problem
Report you generate will be sent to the @var{site}, which is usually the
site from which you received your distribution of @w{@code{send-pr}}.
If you use @sc{gnats} at your own organization, the default is usually
your local address for reporting problems.

To change this, simply edit the file @file{Makefile} before installing
and change the line 

@smallexample
GNATS_SITE = @var{site}
@end smallexample

@noindent
to reflect the site where you wish to send PRs by default.
