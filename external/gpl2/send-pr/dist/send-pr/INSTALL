	Installation procedures for `send-pr'

If you receive `send-pr' as part of a larger software distribution, it
will be automatically installed when the full distribution is
installed.  The `send-pr' directory, however, is easily installed by
itself by following these steps:

1.  Unpack the distribution into a directory which we will refer to as
    SRCDIR.  

2.  Edit the `Makefile' to reflect local conventions.

    Specifically, you should edit the variable "prefix" to alter
    the installation location.  The default is '/usr/local'.  All
    files are installed under "prefix" (see below).

3.  Run 
	make all install [ info ] install-info [ clean ]

    from the "build directory".  The targets mean the following:

	 all	Builds `send-pr' and `install-sid'

     install	Installs the following:

			    send-pr	into PREFIX/bin 
			install-sid	into PREFIX/bin
			  send-pr.1	into PREFIX/man/man1
			 categories	as PREFIX/lib/gnats/SITE
		      send-pr-el.in	as PREFIX/lib/emacs/lisp/send-pr.el

        info	(optional) Builds "send-pr.info" from "send-pr.texi"
		(send-pr.info is included with this distribution)

install-info	Installs "send-pr.info" into PREFIX/info

       clean 	(optional) Removes all intermediary build files that can
		           be rebuilt from source code

4.  Run 

	install-sid SID

    where SID is the submitter identification code you received with
    `send-pr'.  If you've downloaded `send-pr' from the Net, use "net"
    for this value.


5.  Any users who wish to use the Emacs version of `send-pr' must place
    the following line in their ".emacs" files:

	(autoload 'send-pr "send-pr" "Submit a Problem Report." t)


6.  Create a mail alias for the support site you received `send-pr'
    from, and for every site with which you wish to use `send-pr' to
    communicate with, each with a suffix of `-gnats'.  The support
    site(s) will provide the correct addresses toward which these
    aliases should point.  For instance, edit your mail aliases file
    to contain something like:

	# support sites; for use with send-pr
	cygnus-gnats:     bugs@cygnus.com            # Cygnus Support
	bumblebee-gnats:  bumblebugs@bumblebee.com   # Bumblebee BASIC, Inc.
	mycompany-gnats:  bugs@my.company.com      (if you use GNATS locally)

    `send-pr' automatically searches for these aliases when you type

	send-pr cygnus
	send-pr bumblebee
	send-pr SITE...

    `send-pr' also uses SITE to determine the categories of bugs the site
    in question accepts by looking in PREFIX/lib/gnats/SITE


7.  That's it!  See "send-pr.info", "send-pr.texi", and/or "send-pr.1" for
    information on using `send-pr'.
