# Rough instructions for importing new dtc release:
#
#	$ cd /some/where/temporary
#	$ tar xpfz /dtc/release/tar/file
#	$ DTCSRCS=$(pwd)
#	$ WRKDIR=/an/other/temporary
#	$ sh /usr/src/external/gpl2/dtc/dtc2netbsd $DTCSRCS $WRKDIR
#
# Import libfdt using
#	$ cd $WRKDIR/libfdt
#	$ cvs import -m "Import libfdt <version>" src/sys/external/bsd/libfdt/dist DTC dtc-<version>
#
# merge libfdt sources using, e.g.
#	$ cvs -d cvs.netbsd.org:/cvsroot checkout -jdtc-1-4-1 -jdtc-1-4-4 src/sys/external/bsd/libfdt/dist
#
# Import dtc using
#	$ cd $WRKDIR/dtc
#	$ cvs import -m "Import dtc YYYY-MM-DD" src/external/gpl2/dtc/dist DTC dtc-<version>
# merge dtc sources using, e.g.
# 	$ cvs -d cvs.netbsd.org:/cvsroot checkout -jdtc-1-4-1 -jdtc-1-4-4 src/external/gpl2/dtc/dist
#
# Update the version string in the version_gen.h header to match the imported version:
#	$ echo '#define DTC_VERSION "DTC 1.4.4"' > src/external/gpl2/dtc/usr.bin/dtc/version_gen.h
