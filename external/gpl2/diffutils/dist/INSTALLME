Please send comments and problem reports to <bug-gnu-utils@gnu.org>.

If you have a problem with internationalization, you might be able to
work around it as described in ABOUT-NLS by invoking `./configure
--disable-nls'.  Many of the problems arise from dynamic linking
issues on non-GNU platforms (e.g. with the iconv library).  Such
problems tend to be shared by other GNU applications on these
platforms, and can usually be fixed by carefully tweaking your non-GNU
installation.  If you have an older version of libiconv, please
upgrade to the latest one, preferably libiconv-1.8 or newer.
(libiconv-1.8 is not yet available as of this writing, but it should
be out soon.)  If the problem seems isolated to diffutils, though,
please report a bug.

This program requires a Standard C compiler (C89 or later); if you
have an older K&R compiler, please install GCC first.

If you make changes to the source code, you may need recent test
versions of GNU build tools to regenerate the intermediate files.  The
following versions were used to generate the intermediate files in
this distribution:

* GNU Autoconf 2.53 <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf/autoconf-2.53.tar.gz>

* GNU Automake 1.6 <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/automake/automake-1.6.tar.gz>

* GNU gettext 0.11.1 <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gettext/gettext-0.11.1.tar.gz>

* GNU help2man 1.27 <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/help2man/help2man-1.27.tar.gz>

* GNU texinfo 4.2 <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/texinfo/texinfo-4.2.tar.gz>
