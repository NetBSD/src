#include "allocsa.h"

/* The speed critical point in this file is freesa() applied to an alloca()
   result: it must be fast, to match the speed of alloca().  The speed of
   mallocsa() and freesa() in the other case are not critical, because they
   are only invoked for big memory sizes.  */

#if HAVE_ALLOCA

/* Store the mallocsa() results in a hash table.  This is needed to reliably
   distinguish a mallocsa() result and an alloca() result.

   Although it is possible that the same pointer is returned by alloca() and
   by mallocsa() at different times in the same application, it does not lead
   to a bug in freesa(), because:
     - Before a pointer returned by alloca() can point into malloc()ed memory,
       the function must return, and once this has happened the programmer must
       not call freesa() on it anyway.
     - Before a pointer returned by mallocsa() can point into the stack, it
       must be freed.  The only function that can free it is freesa(), and
       when freesa() frees it, it also removes it from the hash table.  */
