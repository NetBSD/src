/* The list of fatal signals.
   These are those signals whose default action is to terminate the process
   without a core dump, except
     SIGKILL - because it cannot be caught,
     SIGALRM SIGUSR1 SIGUSR2 SIGPOLL SIGIO SIGLOST - because applications
       often use them for their own purpose,
     SIGPROF SIGVTALRM - because they are used for profiling,
     SIGSTKFLT - because it is more similar to SIGFPE, SIGSEGV, SIGBUS,
     SIGSYS - because it is more similar to SIGABRT, SIGSEGV,
     SIGPWR - because it of too special use,
     SIGRTMIN...SIGRTMAX - because they are reserved for application use.
   plus
     SIGXCPU, SIGXFSZ - because they are quite similar to SIGTERM.  */
