   nonnegative.  This is a macro, not an inline function, so that it
   works correctly even when SIZE_MAX < N.

   By gnulib convention, SIZE_MAX represents overflow in size
   calculations, so the conservative dividend to use here is
   SIZE_MAX - 1, since SIZE_MAX might represent an overflowed value.
   However, malloc (SIZE_MAX) fails on all known hosts where
   sizeof (ptrdiff_t) <= sizeof (size_t), so do not bother to test for
   exactly-SIZE_MAX allocations on such hosts; this avoids a test and
   branch when S is known to be 1.  */
