Newer ALPHA versions of this code are available through
anonymous CVS:

$ cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvs checkout grep

If you are using an old version of cvs, you might have to run
$ cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvs login
first (and just press enter at the password prompt).

Please send comments and problem reports to <bug-grep@gnu.org>.
