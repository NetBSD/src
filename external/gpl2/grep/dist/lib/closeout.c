/* Close standard output, exiting with status STATUS on failure.
   If a program writes *anything* to stdout, that program should `fflush'
   stdout and make sure that it succeeds before exiting.  Otherwise,
   suppose that you go to the extreme of checking the return status
   of every function that does an explicit write to stdout.  The last
   printf can succeed in writing to the internal stream buffer, and yet
   the fclose(stdout) could still fail (due e.g., to a disk full error)
   when it tries to write out that buffered data.  Thus, you would be
   left with an incomplete output file and the offending program would
   exit successfully.

   FIXME: note the fflush suggested above is implicit in the fclose
   we actually do below.  Consider doing only the fflush and/or using
   setvbuf to inhibit buffering.

   Besides, it's wasteful to check the return value from every call
   that writes to stdout -- just let the internal stream state record
   the failure.  That's what the ferror test is checking below.

   It's important to detect such failures and exit nonzero because many
   tools (most notably `make' and other build-management systems) depend
   on being able to detect failure in other tools via their exit status.  */
