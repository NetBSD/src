   WARNINGS
     HOST must be a string representation of a resolvable name for this host.
     Strings containing an IP address in dotted decimal notation will be
     returned as-is, without further resolution.

     The use of the word "canonical" in this context is unfortunate but
     entrenched.  The value returned by this function will be the end result
     of the resolution of any CNAME chains in the DNS.  There may only be one
     such value for any given hostname, though the actual IP address
     referenced by this value and the device using that IP address may each
     actually have any number of such "canonical" hostnames.  See the POSIX
     getaddrinfo spec <http://www.opengroup.org/susv3xsh/getaddrinfo.html">,
     RFC 1034 <http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1034.html>, & RFC 2181
     <http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2181.html> for more on what this confusing
