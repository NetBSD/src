/* Under certain circumstances, we must communicate with the server
   via a socket using send() and recv().  This is because under some
   operating systems (OS/2 and Windows 95 come to mind), a socket
   cannot be converted to a file descriptor -- it must be treated as a
   socket and nothing else.
   
   We may also need to deal with socket routine error codes differently
   in these cases.  This is handled through the SOCK_ERRNO and
   SOCK_STRERROR macros. */

   the block routine.  */

   internally and never return a positive errno code, since it would in

   error code came from a socket routine (to decide whether to use
   SOCK_STRERROR or simply strerror to print an error message). */
