# Usage:
#  dotest TESTNAME COMMAND OUTPUT [OUTPUT2]
# TESTNAME is the name used in the log to identify the test.
# COMMAND is the command to run; for the test to pass, it exits with
# exitstatus zero.
# OUTPUT is a regexp which is compared against the output (stdout and
# stderr combined) from the test.  It is anchored to the start and end
# of the output, so should start or end with ".*" if that is what is desired.
# Trailing newlines are stripped from the command's actual output before
# matching against OUTPUT.
# If OUTPUT2 is specified and the output matches it, then it is also
# a pass (partial workaround for the fact that some versions of expr
# lack \|).

	  # Fix a bug that shows up when checking out files by date with the
	  # "-D date" command line option.  There is code in the original to
	  # handle a special case.  If the date search finds revision 1.1 it
	  # is supposed to check whether revision 1.1.1.1 has the same date
	  # stamp, which would indicate that the file was originally brought
	  # in with "cvs import".  In that case it is supposed to return the
	  # vendor branch version 1.1.1.1.
	  # 
	  # However, there is a bug in the code. It actually compares
	  # the date of revision 1.1 for equality with the date given
	  # on the command line -- clearly wrong. This commit fixes
	  # the coding bug.
	  # 
	  # There is an additional bug which is _not_ fixed yet. 
	  # The date comparison should not be a strict
	  # equality test. It should allow a fudge factor of, say, 2-3
	  # seconds. Old versions of CVS created the two revisions
	  # with two separate invocations of the RCS "ci" command. We
	  # have many old files in the tree in which the dates of

	  # Make sure CVS can merge correctly in circumstances where it
	  # used to mess up (due to a bug which existed in diffutils 2.7
	  # and 2.6, but not 2.5, and which has been fixed in CVS's diff
	  # lib by Paul Eggert, bless his bitty heart).

	  # This first test involves two working copies, "mine" and
	  # "yours", checked out from the same repository at the same
	  # time.  In yours, you remove some text from the end of the
	  # file and check it in; meanwhile, "me" has commented out some
	  # lines earlier in the file, and I go to check it in right
	  # after you checked yours in.  CVS naturally tells me the file
	  # is not up-to-date, so I run cvs update, but it updates
	  # incorrectly, leaving in the lines of text you just deleted.
	  # Bad!  I'm in too much of a hurry to actually look at the
	  # file, so I check it in and go home, and so your changes have
	  # been lost.  Later you discover this, and you suspect me of
	  # deliberately sabotaging your work, so you let all the air
	  # out of my tires.  Only after a series of expensive lawsuits
	  # and countersuits do we discover that this was all CVS's
	  # fault.
	  #
	  # Luckily, this problem has been fixed now, as our test will
	  # handily confirm, no doubt:

	  # First make a repository containing the original text:

	  # We should be here anyway, but cd to it just in case:
	  cd ${TESTDIR}

	  # the merge algorithm (even in this case of only one of the two

# TODO:
# * Test `cvs update -d foo' (where foo does not exist).
# * Test `cvs update foo bar' (where foo and bar are both from the
#   same directory in the repository).  Suppose one is a branch--make
#   sure that both directories get updated with the respective correct
#   thing.
# * `cvs update ../foo'.  Also ../../foo ./../foo foo/../../bar /foo/bar
#   foo/.././../bar foo/../bar etc.
# * Test all flags in modules file.
#   Test that ciprog gets run both on checkin in that directory, or a
#     higher-level checkin which recurses into it.
# * Test operations on a directory that contains other directories but has
#   no files of its own.
# * -t global option
# * cvs rm followed by cvs add or vice versa (with no checkin in between).
# * cvs rm twice (should be a nice error message).
# * -P option to checkout--(a) refrains from checking out new empty dirs,
#   (b) prunes empty dirs already there.
# * Test that cvs -d `hostname`:${TESTDIR}/non/existent co foo
#   gives an appropriate error (e.g.
#     Cannot access ${TESTDIR}/non-existent/CVSROOT
#     No such file or directory).
#   (like basica-9, but for remote).
# * Test ability to send notifications in response to watches.  (currently
#   hard to test because CVS doesn't send notifications if username is the
#   same).
# * Test the contents of adm files other than Root and Repository.
#   Entries seems the next most important thing.
# * Test the following compatibility issues:
#   - The filler fields in "D" entries in CVS/Entries get preserved
#     (per cvs.texinfo).
#   - Unrecognized entry types in CVS/Entries get ignored (looks like
#     this needs to be documented in cvs.texinfo, but is not)
#   - Test that unrecognized files in CVS directories (e.g. CVS/Foobar)
#     are ignored (per cvs.texinfo).
#   - Test 'cvs history' with symlinks in the path to the working directory.
#   - Remove most of the CVS_SERVER stuff after a reasonable amount of time.
#     The "fork" & "client" series of tests should be left.  4/2/00, CVS
#     1.11.0.1 was altered so that it would default to program_name (set from
#     argv[0]) rather than "cvs", but I'd like this script to work on legacy
#     versions of CVS for awhile.
#   - Testsuite doesn't work with usernames over eight characters in length.
#     Fix it.
