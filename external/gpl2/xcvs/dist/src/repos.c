/* Sanitize the repository name (in place) by removing trailing

 * Without this check, names like "/path/to/repos/./foo" and
 * "/path/to/repos//foo" would be created.  For example, one
 * significant case is the CVSROOT-detection code in commit.c.  It
 * decides whether or not it needs to rebuild the administrative file
 * database by doing a string compare.  If we've done a `cvs co .' to
 * get the CVSROOT files, "/path/to/repos/./CVSROOT" and
 * "/path/to/repos/CVSROOT" are the arguments that are compared!
 *
 * This function ends up being called from the same places as
 * strip_path, though what it does is much more conservative.  Many
 * comments about this operation (which was scattered around in
 * several places in the source code) ran thus:
 *
 *    ``repository ends with "/."; omit it.  This sort of thing used
 *    to be taken care of by strip_path.  Now we try to be more
 *    selective.  I suspect that it would be even better to push it
 *    back further someday, so that the trailing "/." doesn't get into
 *    repository in the first place, but we haven't taken things that
 *    far yet.''        --Jim Kingdon (recurse.c, 07-Sep-97)
