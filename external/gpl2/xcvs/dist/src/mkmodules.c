       CVSROOTADM_PASSWD contains *all* passwords, not just the ones
       currently being used.  For example, it could be too easy to
       accidentally give someone readonly access to CVSROOTADM_PASSWD
       (e.g. via anonymous CVS or cvsweb), and then if there are any
       guessable passwords for read/write access (usually there will be)
       they get read/write access.

       Another worry is the implications of storing old passwords--if
       someone used a password in the past they might be using it
       elsewhere, using a similar password, etc, and so saving old
       passwords, even hashed, is probably not a good idea.  */
