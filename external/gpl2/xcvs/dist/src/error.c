/* Print the program name and error message MESSAGE, which is a printf-style
 * format string with optional args, like:
 *
 *   PROGRAM_NAME CVS_CMD_NAME: MESSAGE: ERRNUM
 *
 * or, when STATUS is non-zero:
 *
 *   PROGRAM_NAME [CVS_CMD_NAME aborted]: MESSAGE: ERRNUM
 *
 * CVS_CMD_NAME & ERRMSG may or may not appear in the output (the `:' before
 * ERRMSG will disappear as well when ERRNUM is not present).  ERRMSG
 * represents the system dependent message returned by strerror (ERRNUM), when
 * ERRNUM is non-zero.
 *
 * Exit with status EXIT_FAILURE if STATUS is nonzero.
 *
 * If this function fails to get any memory it might request, it attempts to
 * log a "memory exhausted" message to the syslog, when syslog is available,
 * without any further attempts to allocate memory, before exiting.  See NOTES
 * below for more information on this functions memory allocation.
 *
 * INPUTS
 *   status	When non-zero, exit with EXIT_FAILURE rather than returning.
 *   errnum	When non-zero, interpret as global ERRNO for the purpose of
 *		generating additional error text.
 *   message	A printf style format string.
 *   ...	Variable number of args, as printf.
 *
 * GLOBALS
 *   program_name	The name of this executable, for the output message.
 *   cvs_cmd_name	Output in the error message, when it exists.
 *   errno		Accessed simply to save and restore it before
 *			returning.
 *
 * NOTES
 *   This function goes to fairly great lengths to avoid allocating memory so
 *   that it can relay out-of-memory error messages to the client.  Any error
 *   messages which fit in under 256 characters (after expanding MESSAGE with
 *   ARGS but before adding any ERRNUM text) should not require memory
 *   allocation before they are sent on to cvs_outerr().  Unfortunately,
 *   cvs_outerr() and the buffer functions it uses to send messages to the
 *   client still don't make this same sort of effort, so in local mode
 *   out-of-memory errors will probably get printed properly to stderr but if a
 *   memory outage happens on the server, the admin will need to consult the
 *   syslog to find out what went wrong.
 *
 *   I think this is largely cleaned up to the point where it does the right
 *   thing for the server, whether the normal server_active (child process)
 *   case or the error_use_protocol (parent process) case.  The one exception
 *   is that STATUS nonzero for error_use_protocol probably doesn't work yet;
 *   in that case still need to use the pending_error machinery in server.c.
 *
 *   error() does not molest errno; some code (e.g. Entries_Open) depends
 *   on being able to say something like:
 *
 *      error (0, 0, "foo");
 *      error (0, errno, "bar");
 *
 * RETURNS
 *   Sometimes.  ;)
