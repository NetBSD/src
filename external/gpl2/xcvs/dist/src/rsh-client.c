	   a Kerberized one, which one might want to use).  If we

	   consistently produce the same result in the face of

	   would require us to keep track of what the defaults are for
	   each system type, and probably would cope poorly if the
	   existence of remsh or rsh varies from OS version to OS
	   version.  Therefore, it seems best to have the default
	   remain "rsh", and tell HPUX users to specify remsh, for
