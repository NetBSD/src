 * ...

 * but the old format is supported for backwards compatibility.
 * The entry version string wasn't strictly necessary, but it avoids the
 * overhead of parsing some entries since we know it is already in canonical
 * form and allows room for expansion later, say, if we want to allow spaces
 * and/or other characters to be escaped in the string.  Also, the new entries
 * would have been ignored by old versions of CVS anyhow since those versions
 * didn't know how to parse a port number.
 *
 * The "A" before "encoded_password" is a literal capital A.  It's a
 * version number indicating which form of scrambling we're doing on
 * the password -- someday we might provide something more secure than
 * the trivial encoding we do now, and when that day comes, it would
 * be nice to remain backward-compatible.
 *
 * Like .netrc, the file's permissions are the only thing preventing
