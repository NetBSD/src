- if you are initializing the repository after applying patch, related
  config files will be created with init command.
  "cvs -d /path/to/repository init"
- if you already have a repository, you have to add the aclconfig file
  to your $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/. aclconfig.default is the default configuration
  file, you can rename it to aclconfig, and use it .
- modify aclconfig file, if you need to change some options. 
- as the last step, you have to define yourself as acl administrator.
  "cvs -d /path/to/repository racl yourname:p -r ALL -d ALL"
  this command gives p (acl admin) rights to user (yourname),
  on all repository and tags/branches.
