[\-P|\-\-partial]
[\-v|\-\-verbose]
.SH DESCRIPTION
vgscan scans all SCSI, (E)IDE disks, multiple devices and a bunch
of other disk devices in the system looking for LVM physical volumes
and volume groups.  Define a filter in \fBlvm.conf\fP(5) to restrict 
the scan to avoid a CD ROM, for example.
.LP
In LVM2, vgscans take place automatically; but you might still need to
run one explicitly after changing hardware.
.SH OPTIONS
See \fBlvm\fP for common options.
.TP
.I \-\-mknodes
Also checks the LVM special files in /dev that are needed for active 
logical volumes and creates any missing ones and removes unused ones.
