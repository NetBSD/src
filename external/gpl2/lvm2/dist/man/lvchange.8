.SH DESCRIPTION
lvchange allows you to change the attributes of a logical volume
including making them known to the kernel ready for use.
.SH OPTIONS
See \fBlvm\fP for common options.
.TP
.I \-a, \-\-available y|n|ey|en|ly|ln
Controls the availability of the logical volumes for use.
Communicates with the kernel device-mapper driver via
libdevmapper to activate (-ay) or deactivate (-an) the 
logical volumes.
.IP
If clustered locking is enabled, -aey will activate exclusively
on one node and -aly will activate only on the local node.
To deactivate only on the local node use -aln.
Logical volumes with single-host snapshots are always activated 
exclusively because they can only be used on one node at once.
.TP
.I \-C, \-\-contiguous y|n
Tries to set or reset the contiguous allocation policy for
logical volumes. It's only possible to change a non-contiguous
logical volume's allocation policy to contiguous, if all of the
allocated physical extents are already contiguous.
.TP
.I \-\-resync
Forces the complete resynchronization of a mirror.  In normal
circumstances you should not need this option because synchronization
happens automatically.  Data is read from the primary mirror device
and copied to the others, so this can take a considerable amount of
time - and during this time you are without a complete redundant copy
of your data.
.TP
.I \-\-minor minor
Set the minor number.
.TP
.I \-\-monitor y|n
Controls whether or not a mirrored logical volume is monitored by
dmeventd, if it is installed.
If a device used by a monitored mirror reports an I/O error,
the failure is handled according to 
\fBmirror_image_fault_policy\fP and \fBmirror_log_fault_policy\fP
set in \fBlvm.conf\fP.
.TP
.I \-\-noudevsync
Disable udev synchronisation. The
process will not wait for notification from udev.
It will continue irrespective of any possible udev processing
in the background.  You should only use this if udev is not running
or has rules that ignore the devices LVM2 creates.
.TP
.I \-\-ignoremonitoring
Make no attempt to interact with dmeventd unless \-\-monitor
is specified.
Do not use this if dmeventd is already monitoring a device.
.TP
.I \-M, \-\-persistent y|n
Set to y to make the minor number specified persistent.
.TP
.I \-p, \-\-permission r|rw
Change access permission to read-only or read/write.
.TP
.I \-r, \-\-readahead ReadAheadSectors|auto|none
Set read ahead sector count of this logical volume.
For volume groups with metadata in lvm1 format, this must
be a value between 2 and 120 sectors.
The default value is "auto" which allows the kernel to choose
a suitable value automatically.
"None" is equivalent to specifying zero.
.TP
.I \-\-refresh
If the logical volume is active, reload its metadata.
This is not necessary in normal operation, but may be useful
if something has gone wrong or if you're doing clustering 
manually without a clustered lock manager.
.SH Examples
"lvchange -pr vg00/lvol1" changes the permission on 
volume lvol1 in volume group vg00 to be read-only.
