.SH DESCRIPTION
lvresize allows you to resize a logical volume.
Be careful when reducing a logical volume's size, because data in the reduced
part is lost!!!
You should therefore ensure that any filesystem on the volume is
shrunk first so that the extents that are to be removed are not in use.
Resizing snapshot logical volumes (see
.B lvcreate(8)
for information about creating snapshots) is supported as well.
But to change the number of copies in a mirrored logical
volume use 
.BR lvconvert (8).
.SH OPTIONS
See \fBlvm\fP for common options.
.TP
.I \-l, \-\-extents [+|-]LogicalExtentsNumber[%{VG|LV|PVS|FREE}]
Change or set the logical volume size in units of logical extents.
With the + or - sign the value is added to or subtracted from the actual size
of the logical volume and without it, the value is taken as an absolute one.
The number can also be expressed as a percentage of the total space
in the Volume Group with the suffix %VG, relative to the existing
size of the Logical Volume with the suffix %LV, as a percentage of
the remaining free space of the PhysicalVolumes on the command line with the
suffix %PVS, or as a percentage of the remaining free space in the
Volume Group with the suffix %FREE.
.TP
.I \-L, \-\-size [+|-]LogicalVolumeSize[kKmMgGtTpPeE]
Change or set the logical volume size in units of megabytes.
A size suffix of M for megabytes,
G for gigabytes, T for terabytes, P for petabytes 
or E for exabytes is optional.
With the + or - sign the value is added to or subtracted from
the actual size of the logical volume and without it, the value is taken as an
absolute one.
.TP
.I \-i, \-\-stripes Stripes
Gives the number of stripes to use when extending a Logical Volume.
Defaults to whatever the last segment of the Logical Volume uses.
Not applicable to LVs using the original metadata LVM format, which must
use a single value throughout.
.TP
.I \-I, \-\-stripesize StripeSize
Gives the number of kilobytes for the granularity of the stripes.
Defaults to whatever the last segment of the Logical Volume uses.
Not applicable to LVs using the original metadata LVM format, which
must use a single value throughout.
.br
StripeSize must be 2^n (n = 2 to 9)
