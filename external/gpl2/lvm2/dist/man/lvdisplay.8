* logical volume size in sectors
* current logical extents associated to logical volume
* allocated logical extents of logical volume

physical extents.
.SH Examples
"lvdisplay -v /dev/vg00/lvol2" shows attributes of that logical volume.
If snapshot
logical volumes have been created for this original logical volume,
this command shows a list of all snapshot logical volumes and their
status (active or inactive) as well.

"lvdisplay /dev/vg00/snapshot" shows the attributes of this snapshot
logical volume and also which original logical volume
it is associated with.
