# XXX
# DGA support for this driver is broken:
# - dga(1) crashes X server since pScrn->AdjustFrame is NULL.
# - If nop is provided as pScrn->AdjustFrame, dga(1) crashes X server *AND*
#   kernel. This is because DGA uses physical address of framebuffer via
#   /dev/mem (oops!), but we provide only mmap(2)'ed virtual address.
