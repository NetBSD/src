# XXX our freetype shlib versioning is insane. the rest of the world
# uses a major of 6. we used to, but it was bumped to 7 for 64 bit
# time_t changes. should've stayed there, but it didn't, because of
# confusion between libtool versioning and shlib versioning.
# until upstream bumps their major, keep major at 18 and adjust
# minor/teeny as indicated by xsrc/external/mit/freetype/dist/docs/VERSIONS.TXT

major=18
