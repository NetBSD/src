# XXX our freetype shlib versioning is insane. the rest of the world
# uses a major of 6. we used to, but it was bumped to 7 for 64 bit
# time_t changes. should've stayed there, but it didn't, because of
# confusion between libtool versioning and shlib versioning.
# until upstream bumps their major, keep major at 18 and adjust
# minor/teeny as indicated by xsrc/external/mit/freetype/dist/docs/VERSIONS.TXT

# actually, freetype 2.10 removes (changes) symbols so it needs a
# major shlib bump, but it's now 6.17 ie, they don't bump the major
# major but probably mark the soname with the major.minor.  we are
# now at 19.0 for freetype 2.10.

major=19
minor=0
