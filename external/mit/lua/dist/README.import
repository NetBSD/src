How to import Lua x.y.z
=======================

1. Untar a new version to a directory called dist.work or even
   somethere outside of the tree.
2. Run lua2netbsd script inside that directory.
3. Run 'cvs import src/external/mit/lua/dist LUA LUA_<<x_y_z>>'.
   It's very important to run it from inside the right direcory!
4. Move the dist directory away (is it optional?).
5. Run 'cvs up -dP' to bring the new import to the tree.
6. Run 'cvs up -j LUA_<<previous_version>> -j LUA_<<x_y_z>>'.
   It will generate many conflicts.
7. Resolve conflicts. Most (if not all) conflicts are around RCS
   identifiers.
8. Commit your changes.

Vendor branches are usually named LUA_<<x_y_z>> but if there was a problem
with cvs import, they can be named differently.

The last imported vendor branch is called LUA_5_3_5_try2.
