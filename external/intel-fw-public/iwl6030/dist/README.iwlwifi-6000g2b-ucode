1. OVERVIEW

The file iwlwifi-6000g2b-6.ucode provided in this package must be
present on your system in order for the Intel Wireless WiFi Link
AGN driver for Linux (iwlagn) to operate on your system.

The "-6" in the filename reflects an interface/architecture version number.
It will change only when changes in new uCode releases make the new uCode
incompatible with earlier drivers.

On adapter initialization, and at varying times during the uptime of
the adapter, the microcode is loaded into the memory on the network
adapter.  The microcode provides the low level MAC features including
radio control and high precision timing events (backoff, transmit,
etc.) while also providing varying levels of packet filtering which can
be used to keep the host from having to handle packets that are not of
interest given the current operating mode of the device.

2. INSTALLATION

The iwlagn driver will look for the file iwlwifi-6000g2b-6.ucode using the
kernel's firmware_class infrastructure. More information can be found under
Documentation/firmware_class in kernel source. In order to function
correctly, you need to have this support enabled in your kernel.  When
you configure the kernel, you can find this option in the following
location:

        Device Drivers ->
                Generic Driver Options ->
                        Userspace firmware loading support


You can determine if your kernel currently has firmware loader support
by looking for the CONFIG_FW_LOADER definition on your kernel's
.config.

In addition to having the firmware_class support in your kernel, you
must also have a working udev and uevent infrastructure configured.
The steps for installing and configuring udev are very
distribution specific.

Once you have the firmware loader in place (or if you aren't sure and
you just want to try things to see if it works), you need to install
the microcode file into the appropriate location.

Where that appropriate location is depends (again) on your system
distribution.  You can typically find this location by looking in the
udev scripts of your distro, the default is /lib/firmware.

Installation of the firmware is simply:

        % cp iwlwifi-6000g2b-6.ucode /lib/firmware

You can now load the driver (see the INSTALL and README.iwlwifi provided with
the iwlwifi package for information on building and using that driver.)
