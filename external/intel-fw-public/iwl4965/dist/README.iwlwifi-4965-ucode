1. OVERVIEW

The file iwlwifi-4965-2.ucode provided in this package must be 
present on your system in order for the Intel Wireless WiFi Link
4965AGN driver for Linux (iwlwifi-4965) to operate on your system.

The "-2" in the filename reflects an interface/architecture version number.
It will change only when changes in new uCode releases make the new uCode
incompatible with earlier drivers.

On adapter initialization, and at varying times during the uptime of 
the adapter, the microcode is loaded into the RAM on the network 
adapter.  The microcode provides the low level MAC features including 
radio control and high precision timing events (backoff, transmit, 
etc.) while also providing varying levels of packet filtering which can 
be used to keep the host from having to handle packets that are not of 
interest given the current operating mode of the device.

2. INSTALLATION

The iwlwifi-4965 driver will look for the file iwlwifi-4965-2.ucode using the 
kernel's firmware_loader infrastructure.  In order to function 
correctly, you need to have this support enabled in your kernel.  When 
you configure the kernel, you can find this option in the following 
location:

        Device Drivers ->
                Generic Driver Options ->
                        Hotplug firmware loading support


You can determine if your kernel currently has firmware loader support 
by looking for the CONFIG_FW_LOADER definition on your kernel's 
.config.

In addition to having the firmware_loader support in your kernel, you 
must also have a working hotplug and udev infrastructure configured.  
The steps for installing and configuring hotplug and udev are very 
distribution specific. 

Once you have the firmware loader in place (or if you aren't sure and 
you just want to try things to see if it works), you need to install 
the microcode file into the appropriate location.

Where that appropriate location is depends (again) on your system 
distribution.  You can typically find this location by looking in the 
hotplug configuration file for your distro:

	% grep \"^FIRMWARE_DIR\" /etc/hotplug/firmware.agent

This should give you output like:

	FIRMWARE_DIR=/lib/firmware

If it lists more than one directory, you only need to put the 
microcode in one of them.  In the above example, installation is 
simply:

	% cp iwlwifi-4965-2.ucode /lib/firmware

You can now load the driver (see the INSTALL and README.iwlwifi provided with
the iwlwifi package for information on building and using that driver.)
