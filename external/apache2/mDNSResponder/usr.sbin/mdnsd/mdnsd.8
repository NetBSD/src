.Sh NAME

.Nd Multicast and Unicast DNS daemon    \" Name Description for whatis database
.\"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
(also known as
.Nm mDNSResponder
on some systems)
is a daemon invoked at boot time to implement Multicast DNS and DNS Service Discovery.
On
Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard),
.Nm
is also the system-wide Unicast DNS Resolver.
.Pp
.Nm
listens on UDP port 5353 for Multicast DNS Query packets.
When it receives a query for which it knows an answer,
.Nm
issues the appropriate Multicast DNS Reply packet.
.Pp
.Nm
also performs Unicast and Multicast DNS Queries on behalf of client processes, and
maintains a cache of the replies.
.Pp
.Nm
has no user-specifiable command-line argument, and users should not run
.Nm
manually.
.Ss LOGGING
There are several methods with which to examine
.Nm Ap s
internal state for debugging and diagnostic purposes.
The
.Xr syslogd 8
logging levels map as follows:
.Pp
.Dl Error - Error messages
.Dl Warning - Client-initiated operations
.Dl Notice - Sleep proxy operations
.Dl Info - Informational messages
.Pp
By default, only log level Error is logged.
.Pp
A SIGUSR1 signal toggles additional logging, with Warning and Notice
enabled by default:
.Pp
.Dl # pkill -USR1 mdnsd
.Pp
A SIGUSR2 signal toggles packet logging:
.Pp
.Dl # pkill -USR2 mdnsd
.Pp
A SIGINFO signal will dump a snapshot summary of the internal state to
.Pa /var/log/system.log :
.Pp
.Dl # pkill -INFO mdnsd

.\"
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
daemon first appeared in Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar).
.Pp
Also available from the Darwin open source repository
(though not officially supported by Apple) are
.Nm
daemons for other platforms, including Mac OS 9, Microsoft Windows,
Linux,
.Fx ,
.Nx ,
Solaris, and other POSIX systems.
.\"
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
bugs are tracked in Apple Radar component "mDNSResponder".
