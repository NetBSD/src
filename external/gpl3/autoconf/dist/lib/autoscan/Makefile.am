## Building autoscan.list.  ##
## ------------------------ ##

## autoscan.list might change when autoconf.m4f sources change.
## Therefore we want the same dependencies as autoconf.m4f, which
## are listed in freeze.mk.  It also ensure that tests/autom4te
## is built (we need it in the command below).
