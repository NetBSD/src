Usage: elisp-comp [--help] [--version] FILES...

This script byte-compiles all '.el' files listed as FILES using GNU
Emacs, and put the resulting '.elc' files into the current directory,
so disregarding the original directories used in '.el' arguments.

This script manages in such a way that all Emacs LISP files to
be compiled are made visible between themselves, in the event
they require or load-library one another.

Report bugs to <bug-automake@gnu.org>.
