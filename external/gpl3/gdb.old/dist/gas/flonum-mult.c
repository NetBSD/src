	a[], b[], p[] may not intersect.
	Zero length factors signify 0 significant bits: treat as 0.0.
	0.0 factors do the right thing.
	Zero length product OK.

	I chose the ForTran accent "foo[bar]" instead of the C accent "*garply"
	because I felt the ForTran way was more intuitive. The C way would
	probably yield better code on most C compilers. Dean Elsner.
