/* This isn't quite a "constant" pool.  Some of the values may get
   adjusted at run time, e.g., for symbolic relocations when shared
   libraries are in use.  It's more of a "literal" pool.

   On the Alpha, this should be used for .lita and .lit8.  (Is there
   ever a .lit4?)  On the MIPS, it could be used for .lit4 as well.

   The expressions passed here should contain either constants or symbols,
   not a combination of both.  Typically, the constant pool is accessed
   with some sort of GP register, so the size of the pool must be kept down
   if possible.  The exception is section offsets -- if you're storing a
   pointer to the start of .data, for example, and your machine provides
   for 16-bit signed addends, you might want to store .data+32K, so that
   you can access all of the first 64K of .data with the one pointer.

   This isn't a requirement, just a guideline that can help keep .o file
   size down.  */
