/* We don't want 0x00 for code alignment because this generates `add.p
   gr0, gr0, gr0' patterns.  Although it's fine as a nop instruction,
   it has the VLIW packing bit set, which means if you have a bunch of
   them in a row and attempt to execute them, you'll exceed the VLIW
   capacity and fail.  This also gets GDB confused sometimes, because
   it won't set breakpoints in instructions other than the first of a
   VLIW pack, so you used to be unable to set a breakpoint in the
   initial instruction of a function that followed such
   alignment-introduced instructions.

   We could have arranged to emit `nop' instructions (0x80880000),
   maybe even VLIW-pack sequences of nop instructions as much as
   possible for the selected machine type, just in case the alignment
   code actually happens to run, but this is probably too much effort
   for little gain.  This code is not meant to be run anyway, so just
   emit nops.  */
