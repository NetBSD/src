/* Originally written by Ira Ruben, 06/28/93.  */

/*  This is a compiler independent representation of the AIX Version 3 traceback table (in
    sys/debug.h), which occurs, usually, one per procedure (routine). The table is marked by
    a multiple of 4 32-bit word of zeroes in the instruction space. The traceback table is
    also referred to as "procedure-end table".

    The AIX traceback table representation on which this header is based is defined as a
    series of bit field struct specifications. Bit fields are compiler dependent! Thus,
    the definitions presented here follow the original header and the existing documentation
    (such as it is), but define the fields as BIT MASKS and other macros. The mask names,
    however, where chosen as the original field names to give some compatibility with the
    original header and to agree with the documentation.  */
