/* This header file is internal to BFD.  It describes the internal
   structures and functions used by the BFD generic linker, in case
   any of the more specific linkers want to use or call them.  Note
   that some functions, such as _bfd_generic_link_hash_table_create,
   are declared in libbfd.h, because they are expected to be widely
   used.  The functions and structures in this file will probably only
   be used by a few files besides linker.c itself.  In fact, this file
   is not particularly complete; I have only put in the interfaces I
   actually needed.  */
