/* This file implements the interface between the host and the simulated
   FPU.  IEEE trap handling is done as follows:
     1. In the host, all IEEE traps are masked
     2. After each simulated FPU instruction, check if any exception
        occured by reading the exception bits from the host FPU status
        register (get_accex()).
     3. Propagate any exceptions to the simulated FSR.
     4. Clear host exception bits.
