This is the frv simulator directory.

It is still work-in-progress.  The current sources are
well tested and lots of features are in.

There are lots of machine generated files in the source directory!
They are only generated if you configure with --enable-cgen-maint,
similar in behaviour to Makefile.in, configure under automake/autoconf.

For details on the generator, see ../../cgen.
