- header file dependencies revisit
- hooks cleanup
- testsuites
- FIXME's
- memory accesses still test if profiling is on even in fast mode
- have semantic code use G/SET_H_FOO if not default [incl fun-access]
- have G/SET_H_FOO macros call function if fun-access
- --> can always use G/S_H_FOO macros
