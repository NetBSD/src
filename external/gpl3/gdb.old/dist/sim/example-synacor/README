The Synacor Challenge is a fun programming exercise with a number of puzzles
built into it.  You can find more details about it here:

The first puzzle is writing an interpreter for their custom ISA.  This is a
simulator for that custom CPU.  The CPU is quite basic: it's 16-bit with only
8 registers and a limited set of instructions.  This means the port will never
grow new features.  See README.arch-spec for more details.

Implementing it here ends up being quite useful: it acts as a simple constrained
"real world" example for people who want to implement a new simulator for their
own architecture.  We demonstrate all the basic fundamentals (registers, memory,
branches, and tracing) that all ports should have.
