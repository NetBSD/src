# We must use 32-bit addresses to support memory bank switching.
# The WORD_BITSIZE is normally 16 but must be switched (temporarily)
# to 32 to avoid a bug in the sim-common which uses 'unsigned_word'
# instead of 'address_word' in some places (the result is a truncation
# of the 32-bit address to 16-bit; and this breaks the simulator).
