/* Read a table, line by line, from a file.

   A table line has several forms:

   Field line:

       <text> { ":" <text> }
       type == table_colon_entry

       Fields points to a NULL terminated list of pointers.

   Tab indented block:

     <tab> <text> <nl> { <tab> <text> <nl> }
     type == table_code_entry

     The leading tab at the start of each line is discarded.
     fields[i] is the i'th line with the <nl> discarded.
     

   Code block:

     "{" <ignore-text> <nl> { <text> <nl> } "}" <ignore-text> <nl>
     type == table_code_entry

     The leading/trailing {/} lines are discarded.
     Lines containing two leading spaces have those spaces striped.
     fields[i] is the i'th line with the <nl> discarded.

   In addition, the table parser reconises and handles internally the
   following (when not in a code block):

     "#" <line-nr> '"' <file> '"'

     As per CPP/CC, treat following lines as if they were taken from
     <file> starting at <line-nr>

   No support for CPP's "#if/#else/#endif" style conditions are
   planned. */
