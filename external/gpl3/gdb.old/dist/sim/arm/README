This directory contains the standard release of the ARMulator from
Advanced RISC Machines, and was ftp'd from.

ftp.cl.cam.ac.uk:/arm/gnu

It likes to use TCP/IP between the simulator and the host, which is
nice, but is a pain to use under anything non-unix.

I've added created a new Makefile.in (the original in Makefile.orig)
to build a version of the simulator without the TCP/IP stuff, and a
wrapper.c to link directly into gdb and the run command.

It should be possible (barring major changes in the layout of
the armulator) to upgrade the simulator by copying all the files
out of a release into this directory and renaming the Makefile.

(Except that I changed armos.c to work more simply with our
simulator rigs)
