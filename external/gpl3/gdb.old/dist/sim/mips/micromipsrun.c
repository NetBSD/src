/* These definitions come from the *_support.h files generated by igen and are
   required because they are used in some of the macros in the code below.
   Unfortunately we can not just blindly include the *_support.h files to get
   these definitions because some of the defines in these files are specific
   for a particular configuration of the simulator for example instruction word
   size is 16 bits for micromips16 and 32 bits for micromips32.  This means we
   could break future code changes by doing this, so a safer approach is to just
   extract the defines that we need to get this file to compile.  */
