dnl --enable-sim-trace is for users of the simulator
dnl The argument is either a bitmask of things to enable [exactly what is
dnl up to the simulator], or is a comma separated list of names of tracing
dnl elements to enable.  The latter is only supported on simulators that
dnl use WITH_TRACE.  Default to all tracing but internal debug.
