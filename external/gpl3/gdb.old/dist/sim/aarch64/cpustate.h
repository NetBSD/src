/* Float registers provide for storage of a single, double or quad
   word format float in the same register.  Single floats are not
   paired within each double register as per 32 bit arm.  Instead each
   128 bit register Vn embeds the bits for Sn, and Dn in the lower
   quarter and half, respectively, of the bits for Qn.

   The upper bits can also be accessed as single or double floats by
   the float vector operations using indexing e.g. V1.D[1], V1.S[3]
   etc and, for SIMD operations using a horrible index range notation.

   The spec also talks about accessing float registers as half words
   and bytes with Hn and Bn providing access to the low 16 and 8 bits
   of Vn but it is not really clear what these bits represent.  We can
   probably ignore this for Java anyway.  However, we do need to access
   the raw bits at 32 and 64 bit resolution to load to/from integer
   registers.

   Note - we do not use the long double type.  Aliasing issues between
   integer and float values mean that it is unreliable to use them.  */
