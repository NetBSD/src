/* Constructing the device tree:

   The initial device tree populated with devices and basic properties
   is created using the function <<device_tree_add_parsed()>>.  This
   function parses a PSIM device specification and uses it to populate
   the tree accordingly.

   This function accepts a printf style formatted string as the
   argument that describes the entry.  Any properties or interrupt
   connections added to a device tree using this function are marked
   as having a permenant disposition.  When the tree is (re)
   initialized they will be restored to their initial value.
