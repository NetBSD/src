/* ??? These are old notes, kept around for now.
   Collecting profile data and tracing slow us down so we don't do them in
   "fast mode".
   There are 6 possibilities on 2 axes:
   - no-scaching, insn-scaching, basic-block-scaching
   - run with full features or run fast
   Supporting all six possibilities in one executable is a bit much but
   supporting full/fast seems reasonable.
   If the scache is configured in it is always used.
   If pbb-scaching is configured in it is always used.
   ??? Sometimes supporting more than one set of semantic functions will make
   the simulator too large - this should be configurable.  Blah blah blah.
   ??? Supporting full/fast can be more modular, blah blah blah.
   When the framework is more modular, this can be.
