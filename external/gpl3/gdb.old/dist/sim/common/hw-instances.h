/* Instances:

   As with IEEE1275, a device can be opened, creating an instance.
   Instances provide more abstract interfaces to the underlying
   hardware.  For example, the instance methods for a disk may include
   code that is able to interpret file systems found on disks.  Such
   methods would there for allow the manipulation of files on the
   disks file system.  The operations would be implemented using the
   basic block I/O model provided by the disk.

   This model includes methods that faciliate the creation of device
   instance and (should a given device support it) standard operations
   on those instances.
