/* INTEGER QUANTITIES:

   TYPES:

     intNN_t    Signed type of the given bit size
     uintNN_t   The corresponding unsigned type

     signed128     Non-standard type for 128-bit integers.
     unsigned128   Likewise, but unsigned.

   SIZES

     *NN	Size based on the number of bits
     *_NN       Size according to the number of bytes
     *_word     Size based on the target architecture's word
     		word size (32/64 bits)
     *_cell     Size based on the target architecture's
     		IEEE 1275 cell size (almost always 32 bits)
