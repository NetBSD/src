/* Notes:

   When scheduling an event, the a delta of zero/one refers to the
   timeline as follows:

   epoch   0|1              1|2              2|3              3|
   **queue**|--insn--|*queue*|--insn--|*queue*|--insn--|*queue*|
     |   ^               ^        |       ^                ^
     `- +0 ------------ +1 --..   `----- +0 ------------- +1 --..

   When the queue is initialized, the time is set to zero with a
   number of initialization events scheduled.  Consequently, as also
   illustrated above, the event queue should be processed before the
   first instruction.  That instruction being executed during tick 1.

   The simulator main loop may take a form similar to:

       if (halt-/restart-setjmp)
         {

	   .... // Determine who should go next
	   last-cpu-nr = get-last-cpu-nr (sd);
	   next-cpu-nr = get-next-cpu-nr (sd);
	   events-were-last? = (last-cpu-nr >= nr-cpus);
	   events-were-next? = (next-cpu-nr >= nr-cpus);

           .... // process any outstanding events
           sim_events_preprocess (sd, events-were-last?, events-were-next?);
	   if (events-were-next)
	     next-cpu-nr = 0;

           .... // prime main loop

           while (1)
             {
	        .... // model one insn of next-cpu-nr .. nr-cpus
                if (sim_events_tick (sd))
	          sim_events_process (sd);
                next-cpu-nr = 0
	     }
         }

   NB.  In the above pseudo code it is assumed that any cpu-nr >=
   nr-cpus is a marker for the event queue. */
