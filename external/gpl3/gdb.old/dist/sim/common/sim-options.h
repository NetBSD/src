/* ARGV option support.

   Options for the standalone simulator are parsed by sim_open since
   sim_open handles the large majority of them and it also parses the
   options when invoked by gdb [or any external program].

   For OPTION_HANDLER: arg#2 is the processor to apply to option to
   (all if NULL); arg#3 is the option index; arg#4 is the option's
   argument, NULL if optional and missing; arg#5 is nonzero if a
   command is being interpreted. */

  /* The short option with the same meaning ('\0' if none).

     For short options, when OPT.VAL is non-zero, it, instead of
     SHORTOPT is passed to HANDLER.

     For example, for the below:

	{ {"dc", no_argument, NULL, OPTION_VALUE},
	    'd', NULL, "<<description>>", HANDLER},
	{ {NULL, no_argument, NULL, OPTION_VALUE},
	    'e', NULL, "<<description>>", HANDLER},

     the options --dc, -d and -e all result in OPTION_VALUE being
     passed into HANDLER. */

     previous option.

     is not listed in usage and help messages.

     is not listed in usage and help messages.

     If DOC_NAME is a non-empty string then it, insted of OPT.NAME, is
     listed as the name of the option in usage and help messages.

     For example, given the options --set-pc and --set-sp, then:

	{ {"set-pc", no_argument, NULL, OPTION_SET_PC},
