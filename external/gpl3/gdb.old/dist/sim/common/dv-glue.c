/* DEVICE


   glue - glue to interconnect and test hardware ports


   DESCRIPTION


   The glue device provides two functions.  Firstly, it provides a
   mechanism for inspecting and driving the port network.  Secondly,
   it provides a set of boolean primitives that can be used to apply
   combinatorial operations to the port network.

   Glue devices have a variable number of big endian <<output>>
   registers.  Each register is target-word sized.  The registers can
   be read and written.

   Writing to an output register results in an event being driven
   (level determined by the value written) on the devices
   corresponding output port.

   Reading an <<output>> register returns either the last value
   written or the most recently computed value (for that register) as
   a result of an event ariving on that port (which ever was computed
   last).

   At present the following sub device types are available:

   <<glue>>: In addition to driving its output interrupt port with any
   value written to an interrupt input port is stored in the
   corresponding <<output>> register.  Such input interrupts, however,
   are not propogated to an output interrupt port.

   <<glue-and>>: The bit-wise AND of the interrupt inputs is computed
   and then both stored in <<output>> register zero and propogated to
   output interrupt output port zero.


   PROPERTIES


   reg = <address> <size> (required)

   Specify the address (within the parent bus) that this device is to
   live.  The address must be 2048 * sizeof (word) (8k in a 32bit
   simulation) aligned.


   interrupt-ranges = <int-number> <range> (optional)

   If present, this specifies the number of valid interrupt inputs (up
   to the maximum of 2048).  By default, <<int-number>> is zero and
   range is determined by the <<reg>> size.


   PORTS


   int[0..] (input, output)

   Both an input and an output port.


   EXAMPLES


   Enable tracing of the device:

   | -t glue-device \


   Create source, bitwize-and, and sink glue devices.  Since the
   device at address <<0x10000>> is of size <<8>> it will have two
   output interrupt ports.

   | -o '/iobus@0xf0000000/glue@0x10000/reg 0x10000 8' \
   | -o '/iobus@0xf0000000/glue-and@0x20000/reg 0x20000 4' \
   | -o '/iobus@0xf0000000/glue-and/interrupt-ranges 0 2' \
   | -o '/iobus@0xf0000000/glue@0x30000/reg 0x30000 4' \


   Wire the two source interrupts to the AND device:

   | -o '/iobus@0xf0000000/glue@0x10000 > 0 0 /iobus/glue-and' \
   | -o '/iobus@0xf0000000/glue@0x10000 > 1 1 /iobus/glue-and' \


   Wire the AND device up to the sink so that the and's output is not
   left open.

   | -o '/iobus@0xf0000000/glue-and > 0 0 /iobus/glue@0x30000' \


   With the above configuration.  The client program is able to
   compute a two bit AND.  For instance the <<C>> stub below prints 1
   AND 0.

   |  unsigned *input = (void*)0xf0010000;
   |  unsigned *output = (void*)0xf0030000;
   |  unsigned ans;
   |  input[0] = htonl(1);
   |  input[1] = htonl(0);
   |  ans = ntohl(*output);
   |  write_string("AND is ");
   |  write_int(ans);
   |  write_line();


   BUGS


   A future implementation of this device may support multiple
   interrupt ranges.

   Some of the devices listed may not yet be fully implemented.

   Additional devices such as a D flip-flop (DFF), an inverter (INV)
   or a latch (LAT) may prove useful.
