/* Create a memory region within the core.

   CPU - when non NULL, specifes the single processor that the memory
   space is to be attached to. (INIMPLEMENTED).

   LEVEL - specifies the ordering of the memory region.  Lower regions
   are searched first.  Within a level, memory regions can not
   overlap.

   MAPMASK - Bitmask specifying the memory maps that the region is to
   be attached to.  Typically the enums sim-basics.h:access_* are used.

   ADDRESS_SPACE - For device regions, a MAP:ADDRESS pair is
   translated into ADDRESS_SPACE:OFFSET before being passed to the
   client device.

   MODULO - Specifies that accesses to the region [ADDR .. ADDR+NR_BYTES)
   should be mapped onto the sub region [ADDR .. ADDR+MODULO).  The modulo
   value must be a power of two.

   DEVICE - When non NULL, indicates that this is a callback memory
   space and specified device's memory callback handler should be
   called.

   OPTIONAL_BUFFER - when non NULL, specifies the buffer to use for
   data read & written to the region.  Normally a more efficient
   internal structure is used.  It is assumed that buffer is allocated
   such that the byte alignmed of OPTIONAL_BUFFER matches ADDR vis
   (OPTIONAL_BUFFER % 8) == (ADDR % 8)).  It is defined to be a sub-optimal
   hook that allows clients to do nasty things that the interface doesn't
   accomodate. */
