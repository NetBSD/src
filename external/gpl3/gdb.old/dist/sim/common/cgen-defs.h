/* SEM_ARG is intended to hide whether or not the scache is in use from the

   an SCACHE * even when not using the SCACHE since there's no current win to
   making it something else ("not using the SCACHE" is like having a cache
   size of 1).
   The without-extraction case still uses an ARGBUF:
   - consistency with scache version
   - still need to record which operands are written
     This wouldn't be needed if modeling was done in the semantic routines
     but this isn't as general as handling it outside of the semantic routines.
     For example Shade allows calling user-supplied code before/after each
     instruction and this is something that is being planned.
