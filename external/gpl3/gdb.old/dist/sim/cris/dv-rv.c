   rv - Remote Virtual component


   DESCRIPTION


   Socket connection to a remote simulator component, for example one
   for testing a verilog construction.  Protocol defined below.

   There is a set of 32-bit I/O ports, with a mapping from local to
   remote addresses.  There is a set of interrupts expressed as a
   bit-mask, with a mapping from remote to local.  There is a set of
   memory ranges (actual memory defined elsewhere), also with a
   mapping from remote to local addresses, that is expected to be
   accessible to the remote simulator in 32-byte chunks (simulating
   DMA).  There is a mapping from remote cycles (or an appropriate
   elsewhere defined time-slice) to local cycles.

   PROPERTIES

   reg = <address> <size>
   The address (within the parent bus) that this device is to
   be located.

   remote-reg = <remote-address>
   The address of reg on the remote side.  Defaults to 0.

   mem = <address> <size>
   Specify an address-range (within the parent bus) that the remote
   device can access.  The memory is assumed to be already defined.
   If there's no memory defined but the remote side asks for a memory
   access, the simulation is aborted.

   remote-mem = <remote-address>
   The address of mem on the remote side.  Defaults to 0.

   mbox = <address>
   Address of the mailbox interface.  Writes to this address with the
   local address of a mailbox command, a complete packet with length
   and command; (4 or 6)) invokes the mailbox interface.  Reads are
   invalid.  Replies are written to the same address.  Address space
   from <address> up-to-and-including <address>+3 is allocated.

   max-poll-ticks = <local-count>
   Sets the maximum interval between polling the external component,
   expressed in internal cycles.  Defaults to 10000.

   watchdog-interval = <seconds>
   Sets the wallclock seconds between watchdog packets sent to the
   remote side (may be larger if there's no rv activity in that time).
   Defaults to 30.  If set to 0, no watchdog packets are sent.

   intnum = <local-int-0> <local-int-1> ... <local-int-31>
   Defines a map from remote bit numbers to local values to be emitted
   on the "int" port, with the external bit number as the ordinal - 1
   of the local translation.  E.g. 43 121 would mean map external
   (1<<0) to internal 43 and external (1<<1) to internal 121.  The
   default is unity; no translation.  If more than one bit is set in
   the remote interrupt word, the intmultiple property can be used to
   control the translation.

   intmultiple = <intvalue>
   When more than one bit is set in the remote interrupt word, you may
   want to map this situation to a separate interrupt value.  If this
   property is non-zero, it is used as that value.  If it is zero, the
   local value for the "int" port is the bitwise-or of the translated
   local values.

   host = <hostid>
   The hostname or address where the simulator to be used listens.
   Defaults to "127.0.0.1"

   port = <portnumber>
   The hostname or address where the simulator to be used listens.
   Defaults to 10000.

   dummy = <value>
    or
   dummy = <filename>
   Don't connect to a remote side; use initial dummy contents from
   <filename> (which has to be at least as big as the <size> argument
   of reg above) or filled with byte-value <value>.  Mailboxes are not
   supported (can be defined but can not be used) and remote-memory
   accesses don't apply.  The main purpose for this property is to
   simplify use of configuration and simulated hardware that is
   e.g. only trivially initialized but not actually used.


   PORTS

   int (output)
   Driven as a result of a remote interrupt request.  The value is a
   32-bit bitset of active interrupts.


   BUGS

   All and none.


   PROTOCOL

   This is version 1.0 of this protocol, defining packet format and
   actions in a supposedly upward-compatible manner where client and
   servers of different versions are expected to interoperate; the
   format and the definitions below are hopefully generic enough to
   allow this.

   Each connection has a server and a client (this code); the roles
   are known beforehand.  The client usually corresponds to a CPU and
   memory system and the server corresponds to a memory-mapped
   register hardware interface and/or a DMA controller.  They
   communicate using packets with specific commands, of which some
   require replies from the other side; most are intiated by the
   client with one exception.  A reply uses the same format as the
   command.

   Packets are at least three bytes long, where the first two bytes
   form a header, a 16-bit little-endian number that is the total
   length of the packet including the header.  There is also a
   one-byte command.  The payload is optional, depending on the
   command.

   [[16-bit-low-byte-of-length] [16-bit-high-byte-of-length]
    [command/reply] [payload byte 0] [payload byte 1]
    ... [payload byte (length-of-packet - 3)]]

   Commands:

   A client or server that reads an undocumented command may exit with
   a hard error.  Payload not defined or disallowed below is ignored.

   It is expected that future client versions find out the version of
   the server side by polling with base commands, assuming earlier
   versions if a certain reply isn't seen, with newly defined payload
   parts where earlier versions left it undefined.  New commands and
   formats are sent only to the other side after the client and server
   has found out each others version.  Not all servers support all
   commands; the type of server and supported set of commands is
   expected to be known beforehand.

   RV_READ_CMD = 0
   Initiated by the client, requires a reply from the server.  The
   payload from the client is at least 4 bytes, forming a 4-byte
   little-endian address, the rest being undefined.  The reply from
   the server is at least 8 bytes, forming the same address data as in
   the request and the second 4-byte data being the little-endian
   contents.

   RV_WRITE_CMD = 1
   Initiated by the client, requires a reply from the server.  Payload
   from the client is at least 8 bytes, forming a 4-byte little-endian
   word being the address, the rest being the little-endian contents
   to write.  The reply from the server is 8 bytes unless elsewhere
   agreed otherwise, forming the same address and data as in the
   request.  The data sent back may have been altered to correspond to
   defined parts but can safely be discarded.

   RV_IRQ_CMD = 2
   Initiated by the server, no reply.  The payload is 4 bytes, forming
   a little-endian word with bits numbers corresponding to currently
   active interrupt sources; value (1<<N) indicating interrupt source
   N being active.

   RV_MEM_RD_CMD = 3
   Initiated by the server, requires a reply.  A client must know
   beforehand when (in command sequence or constant) the server can
   send this command and if so must then not send any commands of its
   own (including watchdog commands); the server is allowed to assume
   that incoming data is only replies to this command.  The format is
   8 bytes of data; 4 bytes of little-endian address followed by a
   32-bit little endian word with the number of bytes to read.  The
   reply is the same address and number of bytes, followed by the data
   that had been read.

   RV_MEM_WR_CMD = 4
   Initiated by the server, no reply.  The format is the same as a
   reply to RV_MEM_RD_CMD; a 32-bit little-endian address, followed by
   the 32-bit little-endian number of bytes to write (redundant
   information but must be consistent with the packet header).

   RV_MBOX_HANDLE_CMD = 5
   Initiated by the client, requires a reply.  The payload is 4
   undefined bytes followed by an binary blob, the size of the
   blob given by the packet header.  The reply is a 32-bit little
   endian number at the same index as the undefined bytes.  Actual
   semantics are application-specific.

   RV_MBOX_PUT_CMD = 6
   Initiated by the client, requires a reply, with the reply using the
   RV_MBOX_HANDLE_CMD reply format (i.e. *both* that command and
   32-bit little-endian number).  The payload is a 32-bit little
   endian number followed by an undefined payload, at most 20 bytes
   long.  The reply is a 32-bit little endian number.  Actual
   semantics are application-specific.

   RV_WATCHDOG_CMD = 7
   Initiated by the client, no reply.  A version 1.0 client sends no
   payload; a version 1.0 server should ignore any such payload.  A
   version 1.0 server must not send a reply.


   Possible future enhancements:

   Synchronization; server and client reports the number of elapsed
   cycles (unit to-be-defined) at each request or notification.
   Pretty much the top-of-the-todo-list item.

   Large addresses; 1.0 being restricted to 32-bit addresses.

   Variable-size data; currently restricted to 32-bit register
   accesses.

   Specified data endianness (not the packet header) perhaps as part
   of an initial format request; currently little-endian only.


   Usage notes:
   When used with servers sending RV_MEM_RD_CMD but being
   narrow-minded about indata, set watchdog-interval to 0.  Use
   multiple rv instances when there are e.g. separate register and
   memory servers.  Alway log, setting "/rv/trace? true", at the
   development phase.  Borrow from the test-suite.
