// The goal of this program is to verify is strings are handled correctly
// by ICF.  ICF inlines strings that can be merged.  In some cases, the
// addend of the relocation pointing to a string merge section must be
// ignored.  This program has no pair of identical functions that can be
// folded.  However, if the addend is not ignored then get2 and get3 will
// become identical.
