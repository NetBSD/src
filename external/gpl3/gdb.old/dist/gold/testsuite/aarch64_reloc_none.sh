# The goal of this test is to verify that support for the R_AARCH64_NONE
# relocation is implemented and it can be used to inform a linker that
# a section should be preserved during garbage collecting.
# File aarch64_reloc_none.s describes two similar sections, .foo and .bar,
# but .foo is referenced from .text using R_AARCH64_NONE against symbol foo.
# When flag --gc-sections is used, .foo and its symbol foo have to be
# preserved, whereas .bar and its symbol bar have to be discarded.
