// This file tests that we correctly deal with weak undefined symbols
// when searching archive libraries.  If we have a weak undefined symbol,
// it should not cause us to link an archive library member that defines
// that symbol.  However, if the symbol is also listed in a -u option on
// the command line, it should cause the archive member to be linked.

// not load it from the library.

// listed in a -u option on the link command, so we should
