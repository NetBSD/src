// We test that we correctly deal with weak undefined symbols.
// We need to make sure that the symbol is resolved to zero
// by the linker and that no dynamic relocation is generated.

// This source is used to build a shared library that defines
// an arbitrary symbol other than the weak undefined symbol
// referenced by the main program.  The main program will be
// linked with this library so that the symbol remains undefined.
// Through the use of the embedded RPATH, the program will load
// an alternate shared library that does define the symbol,
// so that we can detect whether the symbol was left for runtime
// resolution.
