   Say a developer starts out with:
   ...
   extern void foo (void *ptr) __atttribute__((nonnull (1)));
   void foo (void *ptr) {}
   ...
   with the idea in mind to catch:
   ...
   foo (nullptr);
   ...
   at compile time with -Werror=nonnull, and then adds:
   ...
    void foo (void *ptr) {
   +  gdb_assert (ptr != nullptr);
    }
   ...
   to catch:
   ...
   foo (variable_with_nullptr_value);
   ...
   at runtime as well.

   Said developer then verifies that the assert works (using -O0), and commits
   the code.

   Some other developer then checks out the code and accidentally writes some
   variant of:
   ...
   foo (variable_with_nullptr_value);
   ...
   and builds with -O2, and ... the assert doesn't trigger, because it's
   optimized away by gcc.

   There's no suppported recipe to prevent the assertion from being optimized
   away (other than: build with -O0, or remove the nonnull attribute).  Note
   that -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks does not help.  A patch was submitted
   to improve gcc documentation to point this out more clearly (
   https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/gcc-patches/2021-July/576218.html ).  The
   patch also mentions a possible workaround that obfuscates the pointer
   using:
   ...
    void foo (void *ptr) {
   +  asm ("" : "+r"(ptr));
      gdb_assert (ptr != nullptr);
    }
   ...
   but that still requires the developer to manually add this in all cases
   where that's necessary.

   A warning was added to detect the situation: -Wnonnull-compare, which does
   help in detecting those cases, but each new gcc release may indicate a new
   batch of locations that needs fixing, which means we've added a maintenance
   burden.

   We could try to deal with the problem more proactively by introducing a
   gdb_assert variant like:
   ...
   void gdb_assert_non_null (void *ptr) {
      asm ("" : "+r"(ptr));
      gdb_assert (ptr != nullptr);
    }
    void foo (void *ptr) {
      gdb_assert_nonnull (ptr);
    }
   ...
   and make it a coding style to use it everywhere, but again, maintenance
   burden.

   With all these things considered, for now we go with the solution with the
   least maintenance burden: disable the attribute, such that we reliably deal
   with it everywhere.  */
