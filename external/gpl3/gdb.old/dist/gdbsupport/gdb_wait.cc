/* The underlying idea is that when a Windows program is terminated by
   a fatal exception, its exit code is the value of that exception, as
   defined by the various EXCEPTION_* symbols in the Windows API
   headers.  We thus emulate WTERMSIG etc. by translating the fatal
   exception codes to more-or-less equivalent Posix signals.

   The translation below is not perfect, because a program could
   legitimately exit normally with a status whose value happens to
   have the high bits set, but that's extremely rare, to say the
   least, and it is deemed such a negligibly small probability of
   false positives is justified by the utility of reporting the
   terminating signal in the "normal" cases.  */
