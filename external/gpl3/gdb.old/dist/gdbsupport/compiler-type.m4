# Sets up GDB_COMPILER_TYPE to either 'gcc', 'clang', or 'unknown'.
# The autoconf compiler check will set GCC=yes for clang as well as
# gcc, it's really more of a "is gcc like" check.
#
# By contrast, this will set the GDB_COMPILER_TYPE to 'gcc' only for
# versions of gcc.
#
# There's no reason why this can't be extended to identify other
# compiler types if needed in the future, users of this variable
# should therefore avoid relying on the 'unknown' value, instead
# checks should be written in terms of the known compiler types.
