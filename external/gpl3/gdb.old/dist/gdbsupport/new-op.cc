   on allocation failure and thus query the user for abort/core
   dump/continue, just like xmalloc does.  We don't do this from a
   new-handler function instead (std::set_new_handler) because we want
   to catch allocation errors from within global constructors too.

   Skip overriding if building with -fsanitize=address though.
   Address sanitizer wants to override operator new/delete too in
   order to detect malloc+delete and new+free mismatches.  Our
   versions would mask out ASan's, with the result of losing that
   useful mismatch detection.

   Note that C++ implementations could either have their throw
   versions call the nothrow versions (libstdc++), or the other way
   around (clang/libc++).  For that reason, we replace both throw and
   nothrow variants and call malloc directly.  */
