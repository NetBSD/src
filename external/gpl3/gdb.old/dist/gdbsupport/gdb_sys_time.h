/* On MinGW-w64, gnulib's sys/time.h replaces 'struct timeval' and
   gettimeofday with versions that support 64-bit time_t, for POSIX
   compliance.  However, the gettimeofday replacement does not ever
   return time_t values larger than 31-bit, as it simply returns the
   system's gettimeofday's (signed) 32-bit result as (signed) 64-bit.
   Because we don't really need the POSIX compliance, and it ends up
   causing conflicts with other libraries we use that don't use gnulib
   and thus work with the native struct timeval, such as Winsock2's
   native 'select' and libiberty, simply undefine away gnulib's
   replacements.  */
