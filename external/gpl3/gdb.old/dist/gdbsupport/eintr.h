/* Repeat a system call interrupted with a signal.

   A utility for handling interrupted syscalls, which return with error
   and set the errno to EINTR.  The interrupted syscalls can be repeated,
   until successful completion.  This utility avoids wrapping code with
   manual checks for such errors which are highly repetitive.

   For example, with:

   ssize_t ret;
   do
     {
       errno = 0;
       ret = ::write (pipe[1], "+", 1);
     }
   while (ret == -1 && errno == EINTR);

   You could wrap it by writing the wrapped form:

   ssize_t ret = gdb::handle_eintr (-1, ::write, pipe[1], "+", 1);

   ERRVAL specifies the failure value indicating that the call to the
   F function with ARGS... arguments was possibly interrupted with a
   signal.  */

template<typename ErrorValType, typename Fun, typename... Args>
inline auto
handle_eintr (ErrorValType errval, const Fun &f, const Args &... args)
  -> decltype (f (args...))
{
  decltype (f (args...)) ret;

  do
    {
      errno = 0;
      ret = f (args...);
    }
  while (ret == errval && errno == EINTR);

  return ret;
}
