/* Implements a binary search using C++ iterators.
   This differs from std::binary_search in that it returns an iterator for
   the found element and in that the type of EL can be different from the
   type of the elements in the container.

   COMP is a C-style comparison function with signature:
   int comp(const value_type& a, const T& b);
   It should return -1, 0 or 1 if a is less than, equal to, or greater than
   b, respectively.
   [first, last) must be sorted.

   The return value is an iterator pointing to the found element, or LAST if
   no element was found.  */
