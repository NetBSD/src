/* This tests GDB's handling of the DWARF is-stmt field in the line table.

   This field is used when many addresses all represent the same source
   line.  The address(es) at which it is suitable to place a breakpoint for
   a line are marked with is-stmt true, while address(es) that are not good
   places to place a breakpoint are marked as is-stmt false.

   In order to build a reproducible test and exercise GDB's is-stmt
   support, we will be generating our own DWARF.  The test will contain a
   series of C source lines, ensuring that we get a series of assembler
   instructions.  Each C source line will be given an assembler label,
   which we use to generate a fake line table.

   In this fake line table each assembler block is claimed to represent a
   single C source line, however, we will toggle the is-stmt flag.  We can
   then debug this with GDB and test the handling of is-stmt.  */
