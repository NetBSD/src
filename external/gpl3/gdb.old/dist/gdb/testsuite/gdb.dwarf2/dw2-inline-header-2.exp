# Place the first brekpoint at file 2, line 22 and a second breakpoint
# at file 1, line 19.  A third breakpoint is placed at file 1, line
# 18, but as this line table entry will have been discarded[1] the
# third breakpoint will actually be placed at the same location as the
# second breakpoint.
#
# This test is designed to test GDB's internal behaviour with respect
# to discarding particular line table entries.  GCC and DWARF are
# starting to introduce the idea of line table views.  As the views
# information becomes better supported within GDB it is likely that
# this will become out of date.  This is fine, the test will have
# served its purpose by that point and can be deleted.
#
# [1] The entry for file 1, line 18 is discarded because it is at the
# same address as the previous entry, but the previous entry is-stmt,
# while line 18 is a non-stmt.
