# Test for issue PR gdb/27059.  The problem was that when resolving a
# dynamic type that was not-allocated GDB would still try to execute
# the DWARF expressions for the upper, lower, and byte-stride values.
#
# The problem is that, at least in some gfortran compiled programs,
# these values are undefined until the array is allocated.
#
# As a result, executing the dwarf expressions was triggering integer
# overflow in some cases.
#
# This test aims to make the sometimes occurring integer overflow a
# more noticeable error by creating an array that is always marked as
# not-allocated.
#
# The dwarf expressions for the various attributes then contains an
# infinite loop.  If GDB ever tries to execute these expressions we
# will get a test timeout.  With this issue fixed the expressions are
# never executed and the test completes as we'd expect.
