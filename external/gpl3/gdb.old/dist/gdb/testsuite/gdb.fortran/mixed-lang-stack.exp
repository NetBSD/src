# This test covers some basic functionality for debugging mixed
# Fortran, C, and C++ applications.  Features tested include examining
# the backtrace, and printing frame arguments in frames of different
# languages.
#
# One important aspect of this test is that we set the language in
# turn to auto, fortran, c, and c++, and carry out the full test in
# each case to ensure that trying to print objects or types from one
# language, while GDB's language is set to another, doesn't crash GDB.
