# Regression test for PR tui/21216 - TUI line breaks regression.
#
# Tests that newlines in filtered output force a "carriage return" in
# the TUI command window.  With a broken gdb, instead of:
#
#  (gdb) printf "hello\nworld\n"
#  hello
#  world
#  (gdb)
#
# we'd get:
#
#  (gdb) printf "hello\nworld\n"hello
#                                    world
#
#  (gdb)
