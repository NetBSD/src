# This test checks the behavior of formatted print when applied to a 
# reference value.  The intended behavior is that a formatted print of
# such a value should display the same value as a plain print, 
# modulo format, of course.  Older versions of GDB would instead print
# the reference's address value itself when doing a formatted print,
# rather than printing both that and the dereferenced value.  We also
# check that the (non-standard) expression &(&x), where x is of type T&,
# yields an appropriate value.
# This also tests that some other arithmetic operations on references
# work properly: condition expression using a reference object as one of its
# operand.
