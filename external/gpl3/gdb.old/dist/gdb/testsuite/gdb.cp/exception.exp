# This file used to have two copies of the tests with different
# compiler flags for hp-ux.  Instead, the user should set CXXOPTS
# or run runtest with --target_board unix/gdb:debug_flags="..."
# to choose the compiler flags.
#
# The interesting compiler flags are: "aCC +A -Wl,-a,-archive" .
# Static-linked executables use a different mechanism to get the
# address of the notification hook in the C++ support library.

# TODO: this file has many absolute line numbers.
# Replace them with gdb_get_line_number.
