# This file is a dejagnu "board file" and is used to run the testsuite
# with contrib/cc-with-tweaks.sh.
#
# NOTE: If using dwz, We assume it is in $PATH.
#
# Example usage:
# bash$ cd $objdir/gdb
# bash$ make check \
#   RUNTESTFLAGS='--target_board=cc-with-tweaks' \
#   CC_WITH_TWEAKS_FLAGS='-z'
#
# Note: this does not work from $objdir with make check-gdb because
# CC_WITH_TWEAKS_FLAGS is not passed down from the top level Makefile.
#
# The default value of CC_WITH_TWEAKS_FLAGS is "".
