# This file is a dejagnu "board file" and is used to run the testsuite
# with dwarf4 debug information and gdb-generated .gdb_index.
#
# Example usage:
# bash$ make check RUNTESTFLAGS='--target_board=dwarf4-gdb-index'

# This is needed otherwise dejagnu tries to rsh to host "dwarf4-gdb-index".
# set_board_info only sets the value if not already set.
# find_gcc checks for this, so set early.
