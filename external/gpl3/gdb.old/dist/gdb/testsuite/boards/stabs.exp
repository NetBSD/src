# This file is a dejagnu "board file" and is used to run the testsuite
# with stabs support.  Stabs is used less and less these days, ideally
# it will eventually disappear (hey, one can dream).  Until then, this
# board file is a simple way to run the testsuite with stabs.
#
# Example usage:
# bash$ make check RUNTESTFLAGS='--target_board=stabs'
#
# Another way:
# make check RUNTESTFLAGS="--target_board=unix/gdb:debug_flags=-gstabs+"
# While this way doesn't require a board file, this file exists because
# it's easier for some to find.
#
# Note: make check RUNTESTFLAGS=CFLAGS_FOR_TARGET=-gstabs+
# "works" but kinda accidentally.  The right way to set the flag for
# specifying debug information is with the debug_flags board config parameter.

# This is copied from baseboards/unix.exp.
# At the moment this only supports things that unix.exp supports.
