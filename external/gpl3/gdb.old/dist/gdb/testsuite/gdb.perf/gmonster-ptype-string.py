# Measure speed of ptype of a std::string object.
# The difference between this test and gmonster-print-cerr.py is that
# here we are working with fully expanded symtabs.  GDB searches
# these before it searches the index (there is work-in-progress to fix this),
# this test helps measure the issue.
