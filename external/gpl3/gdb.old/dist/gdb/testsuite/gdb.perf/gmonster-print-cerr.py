# Test printing of std::cerr.
# libstdc++ is typically near the end of the list of shared libraries,
# and thus searched last (or near last).
# Plus llvm had a bug where its pubnames output that gold uses to generate
# the index caused a massive perf regression (basically it emitted an entry
# for every CU that used it, whereas we only want the CU with the
# definition).
#
# Note: One difference between this test and gmonster-ptype-string.py
# is that here we do not pre-expand the symtab: we don't want include
# GDB's slowness in searching expanded symtabs first to color these results.
