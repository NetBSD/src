# This unwinder never does any unwinding.  It'll (pretend to) "sniff"
# the frame and ultimately return None, indicating that actual unwinding
# should be performed by some other unwinder.
#
# But, prior to returning None, it will attempt to obtain the value
# associated with a symbol via a call to gdb.parse_and_eval().  In
# the course of doing this evaluation, GDB will potentially access
# some frames, leading to the possibility of a recursive invocation of
# this unwinder.  If that should happen, code contained herein detects
# that and prints a message which will cause some of the associated
# tests to FAIL.
