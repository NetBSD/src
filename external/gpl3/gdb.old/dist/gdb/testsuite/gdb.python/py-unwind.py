        This unwinder can unwind the frames that have been deliberately
        corrupted in a specific way (functions in the accompanying
        py-unwind.c file do that.)
        This code is only on AMD64.
        On AMD64 $RBP points to the innermost frame (unless the code
        was compiled with -fomit-frame-pointer), which contains the
        address of the previous frame at offset 0. The functions
        deliberately corrupt their frames as follows:
                     Before                 After
                   Corruption:           Corruption:
                +--------------+       +--------------+
        RBP-8   |              |       | Previous RBP |
                +--------------+       +--------------+
        RBP     + Previous RBP |       |    RBP       |
                +--------------+       +--------------+
        RBP+8   | Return RIP   |       | Return  RIP  |
                +--------------+       +--------------+
        Old SP  |              |       |              |

        This unwinder recognizes the corrupt frames by checking that
        *RBP == RBP, and restores previous RBP from the word above it.
