#### Dining Philosophers, on LinuxThreads - Jim Blandy <jimb@cygnus.com>
####
#### At the moment, GDB's support for LinuxThreads is pretty
#### idiosyncratic --- GDB's output doesn't look much like the output
#### it produces for other thread implementations, messages appear at
#### different times, etc.  So these tests are specific to LinuxThreads.
####
#### However, if all goes well, Linux will soon have a libthread_db
#### interface, and GDB will manage it the same way it does other
#### libthread_db-based systems.  Then, we can adjust this file to
#### work with any such system.

### Other things we ought to test:
### stepping a thread while others are running
### killing and restarting
### quitting gracefully


# This only works with Linux configurations.
