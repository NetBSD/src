   The original issue we're trying to test is described in this
   thread:

     https://sourceware.org/legacy-ml/gdb-patches/2009-06/msg00802.html

   The NEW_THREAD_EVENT code the comments below refer to no longer
   exists in GDB, so the following comments are kept for historical
   reasons, and to guide future updates to the testcase.

   ---

   Do not use threads as we need to exploit a bug in LWP code masked by the
   threads code otherwise.

   INFERIOR_PTID must point to exited LWP.  Here we use the initial LWP as it
   is automatically INFERIOR_PTID for GDB.

   Finally we need to call target_resume (RESUME_ALL, ...) which we invoke by
   NEW_THREAD_EVENT (called from the new LWP as initial LWP is exited now).  */

     GDB thinks of it as a new thread of the same inferior.  It's a
     bit of an odd setup, but it's not important for what we're
