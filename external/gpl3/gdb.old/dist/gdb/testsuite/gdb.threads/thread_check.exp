# Test break points and single step on thread functions.
# 
# Test Purpose:
# - Test that breakpoints, continue in a threaded  application works. 
#   On powerpc64-unknown-linux-gnu system, running kernel version
#   2.6.5-7.71-pseries64 this test is known to fail due to kernel bug
#   in ptrace system call.
#
# Test Strategy:
# - thread_check.c creates 2 threads
# - start gdb 
# - create 2 breakpoints #1 main() #2 tf() (the thread function)
# - run gdb till #1 main() breakpoint is reached
# - continue to breakpoint #2 tf()
# - delete all breakpoints 
# - exit gdb.
