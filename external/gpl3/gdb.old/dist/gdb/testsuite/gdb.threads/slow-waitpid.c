/* This file contains a library that can be preloaded into GDB on Linux
   using the LD_PRELOAD technique.

   The library intercepts calls to WAITPID and SIGSUSPEND in order to
   simulate the behaviour of a heavily loaded kernel.

   When GDB wants to stop all threads in an inferior each thread is sent a
   SIGSTOP, GDB will then wait for the signal to be received by the thread
   with a waitpid call.

   If the kernel is slow in either delivering the signal, or making the
   result available to the waitpid call then GDB will enter a sigsuspend
   call in order to wait for the inferior threads to change state, this is
   signalled to GDB with a SIGCHLD.

   A bug in GDB meant that in some cases we would deadlock during this
   process.  This was rarely seen as the kernel is usually quick at
   delivering signals and making the results available to waitpid, so quick
   that GDB would gather the statuses from all inferior threads in the
   original pass.

   The idea in this library is to rate limit calls to waitpid (where pid is
   -1 and the WNOHANG option is set) so that only 1 per second can return
   an answer.  Any additional calls will report that no threads are
   currently ready.  This should match the behaviour we see on a slow
   kernel.

   However, given that usually when using this library, the kernel does
   have the waitpid result ready this means that the kernel will never send
   GDB a SIGCHLD.  This means that when GDB enters sigsuspend it will block
   forever.  Alternatively, if GDB enters its polling loop the lack of
   SIGCHLD means that we will never see an event on the child threads.  To
   resolve these problems the library intercepts calls to sigsuspend and
   forces the call to exit if there is a pending waitpid result.  Also,
   when we know that there's a waitpid result that we've ignored, we create
   a new thread which, after a short delay, will send GDB a SIGCHLD.  */
