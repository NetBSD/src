# These tests are the same as those in callfuncs.exp, except that the
# test program here does not call malloc.
#
# "What in the world does malloc have to do with calling functions in
# the inferior?"  Well, nothing.  GDB's ability to invoke a function
# in the inferior program works just fine in programs that have no
# malloc function available.  It doesn't rely on the inferior's
# malloc, directly or indirectly.  It just uses the inferior's stack
# space.
#
# "Then what's the point of this test file?"  Well, it just so happens
# that this file, in addition to testing inferior function calls, also
# tests GDB's ability to evaluate string literals (like "string 1" and
# "string 2" in the tests below).  Evaluating *those* sorts of
# expressions does require malloc.
#
# (As an extension to C, GDB also has a syntax for literal arrays of
# anything, not just characters.  For example, the expression
# {2,3,4,5} (which appears in the tests below) evaluates to an array
# of four ints.  So rather than talking just about string literals,
# we'll use the broader term "array literals".)
#
# Now, in this file, we only evaluate array literals when we're about
# to pass them to a function, but don't be confused --- this is a red
# herring.  You can evaluate "abcdef" even if you're not about to pass
# that to a function, and doing so requires malloc even if you're just
# going to store a pointer to it in a variable, like this:
#
#    (gdb) ptype s
#    type = char *
#    (gdb) set variable s = "abcdef"
#
# According to C's rules for evaluating expressions, arrays are
# converted into pointers to their first element.  This means that, in
# order to evaluate an expression like "abcdef", GDB needs to actually
# find some memory in the inferior we can plop the characters into;
# then we use that memory's address as the address of our array
# literal.  GDB finds this memory by calling the inferior's malloc
# function, if it has one.  So, evaluating an array literal depends on
# performing an inferior function call, but not vice versa.  (GDB
# can't just allocate the space on the stack; the pointer may remain
# live long after the current frame has been popped.)
#
# "But, if evaluating array literals requires malloc, what's the point
# of testing that GDB can do so in a program that doesn't have malloc?
# It can't work!"  On most systems, that's right, but HP-UX has some
# sort of dynamic linking magic that ensures that *every* program has
# malloc.  So on HP-UX, GDB can evaluate array literals even in
# inferior programs that don't use malloc.  That's why this test is in
# gdb.hp.
# 
# This file has, for some reason, led to well more than its fair share
# of misunderstandings about the relationship between array literal
# expressions and inferior function calls.  Folks talk as if you can
# only evaluate array literals when you're about to pass them to a
# function.  I think they're assuming that, since GDB is constructing
# a new frame on the inferior's stack (correct), it's going to use
# that space for the array literals (incorrect).  Remember that those
# array literals may need to be live long after the inferior function
# call returns; GDB can't tell.
#
# What makes the confusion worse is that there *is* a relationship
# between array literals and inferior function calls --- GDB uses
# inferior function calls to evaluate array literals.  But many people
# jump to other, incorrect conclusions about this.
