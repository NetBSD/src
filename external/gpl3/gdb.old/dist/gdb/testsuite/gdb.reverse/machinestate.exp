# This file is part of the GDB testsuite.  
# This test tests the restoration of various kinds of machine state
# to their original values by reverse execution.  We will execute
# the program forward while it changes various types of data, and
# then execute it backward to see if their values get restored.
#
# The types of machine state (data) that are tested are:
#   register variable
#   auto variable
#   function static variable
#   module static variable
#   module global variable
#
# TODO:
# various, possibly including...
#   .bss variable, .data variable, ...
#   shared library variable
#   heap variable (pointer)...
#   overlay variables...
#   Test forward replay
