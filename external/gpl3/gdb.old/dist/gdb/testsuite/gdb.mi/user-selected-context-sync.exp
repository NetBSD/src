# This test checks that the "thread", "select-frame", "frame" and "inferior"
# CLI commands, as well as the "-thread-select" and "-stack-select-frame" MI
# commands send the appropriate user-selection-change events to all UIs.
#
# This test considers the case where console and MI are two different UIs,
# and MI is created with the new-ui command.
#
# It also considers the case where the console commands are sent directly in
# the MI channel as described in PR 20487.
#
# It does so by starting 2 inferiors with 3 threads each.
# - Thread 1 of each inferior is the main thread, starting the others.
# - Thread 2 of each inferior is stopped at /* thread loop line */.
# - Thread 3 of each inferior is either stopped at /* thread loop line */, if we
#   are using all-stop, or running, if we are using non-stop.
