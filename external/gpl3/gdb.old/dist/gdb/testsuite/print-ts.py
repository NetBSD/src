# This is a simple program that can be used to print timestamps on
# standard output.  The inspiration for it was ts(1)
# (<https://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/>).  We have our own version
# because unfortunately ts(1) is or may not be available on all
# systems that GDB supports.
#
# The usage is simple:
#
#   #> some_command | print-ts.py [FORMAT]
#
# FORMAT must be a string compatible with "strftime".  If nothing is
# provided, we choose a reasonable format.
