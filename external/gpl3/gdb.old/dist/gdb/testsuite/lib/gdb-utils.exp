# gdb_get_bp_addr num
#
# Purpose:
#    Get address of a particular breakpoint.
#
# Parameter:
#    The parameter "num" indicates the number of the breakpoint to get.
#    Note that *currently* this parameter must be an integer value.
#    E.g., -1 means that we're gonna get the first internal breakpoint;
#    2 means to get the second user-defined breakpoint.
#
# Return:
#    First address for a particular breakpoint.
#
# TODO:
#    It would be nice if this procedure could accept floating point value.
#    E.g., 'gdb_get_bp_addr 1.2' means to get the address of the second
#    location of breakpoint #1.
