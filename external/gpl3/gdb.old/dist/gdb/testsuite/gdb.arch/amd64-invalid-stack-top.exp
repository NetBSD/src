# In this test we're looking at how gdb handles backtraces and
# investigating the stack depth when confronted with an "invalid" stack,
# that is a stack where the first few frames are normal, and then there's a
# frame where the stack in unreadable.
#
# One interesting bug that has been observed is that gdb will sometime
# exhibit different behaviour the first time a stack command is run
# compared to the second (and later) times a command is run.  This is
# because the first time a command is run gdb actually tries to figure out
# the answer, while the second (and later) times gdb relies on the answer
# cached from the first time.  As a result in this test each command is
# run twice, and we restart gdb before testing each different command to
# ensure that nothing is being cached.
