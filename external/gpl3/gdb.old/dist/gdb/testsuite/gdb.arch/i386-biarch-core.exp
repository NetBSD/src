# Test ability to load an elf64-i386 core file.  The provided core file was
# elf64-x8664 one but it got binary patched to i386:
# Elf32_Ehdr.e_machine @0x12..0x13
# Elf64_Ehdr.e_machine @0x12..0x13
# #define EM_386           3              /* Intel 80386 */
# #define EM_X86_64       62              /* AMD x86-64 architecture */
# patch @0x12: 0x3E -> 0x03

# Wrongly built GDB complains by:
# "..." is not a core dump: File format not recognized
# As the provided test core has 64bit PRSTATUS i386 built GDB cannot parse it.
# This is just a problem of the test case, real-world elf64-i386 file will have
# 32bit PRSTATUS.  One cannot prepare elf64-i386 core file from elf32-i386 by
# objcopy as it corrupts the core file beyond all recognition.
# The output therefore does not matter much, just we should not get GDB
# internal error.
