# Test for watchpoints with conditions that involve inferior function
# calls.

# The skip_hw_watchpoint_tests checks if watchpoints are supported by the
# processor.  On PowerPC, the check runs a small test program under gdb
# to determine if the Power processor supports HW watchpoints.  The check
# must be done before starting the test so as to not disrupt the execution
# of the actual test.
