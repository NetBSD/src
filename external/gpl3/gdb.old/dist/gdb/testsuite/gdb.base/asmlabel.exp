# Test to see that GDB reports the correct function name when stopping
# in a function with several assembly-defined labels; see the test
# case asmlabel.c.
#
# When setting and then continuing to a breakpoint at either location
# L1 or L2 - again, see the code - we want to make sure that GDB
# correctly reports that it's in main, like this:
#
# Breakpoint 2, main (argc=1, argv=0x7fffffffe408) at asmlabel.c:26
# 26        v = 1;                /* set L1 breakpoint here */
#
# This test case was written to test for a bug in which GDB printed
# the following instead:
#
# Breakpoint 2, L1 () at asmlabel.c:26
# 26        v = 1;                /* set L1 breakpoint here */
