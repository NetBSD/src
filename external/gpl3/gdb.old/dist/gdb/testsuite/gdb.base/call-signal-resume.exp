# Test inferior resumption after discarding a hand-called function.
# There are two things to test.
# 1) Inferior stops normally.  Upon resumption it should continue normally,
#    regardless of whatever signal the hand-called function got.
# 2) Inferior is stopped at a signal.  Upon resumption it should continue
#    with that signal, regardless of whatever the hand-called function did.
