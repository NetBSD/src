# At least some versions of Fedora/RHEL glibc have local patches that
# hide the vDSO.  This lines re-exposes it.  See PR libc/13097,
# comment 2.  There's no support for passing environment variables in
# the remote protocol, but that's OK -- if we're testing against a
# glibc that doesn't list the vDSO without this, the test should still
# pass.
