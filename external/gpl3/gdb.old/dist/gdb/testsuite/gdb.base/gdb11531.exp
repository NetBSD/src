# It affects Solaris native targets.

# The breakpoint is probably at the instruction where the value being
# watched (myrec.x) gets updated.  This is the instruction where we
# expect to receive a watchpoint notification when we do the "stepi"
# below.  However, having the breakpoint at the same location as this
# intruction can possibly interfere with our testcase, as stepping
# over the breakpoint in order to get past it may incorrectly lead
# to the debugger missing the watchpoint hit.  This would be a bug
# in GDB, but this is not the bug that we are trying to test here.
# So, we remove all breakpoints first.
