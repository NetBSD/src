   first instruction of the function.  This causes a problem running
   the test on powerpc64le-linux, since the first instruction belongs
   to the global entry point prologue, which is skipped when doing a
   local direct function call.  To make sure that first instruction is
   indeed being executed and the breakpoint hits, we make sure to call
   the routine via an indirect call.  */
