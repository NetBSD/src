# Try printing "this_version_num" qualified with the name of the file
# where the variables are defined.  There are two global variables
# with that name, and some systems such as GNU/Linux merge them
# into one single entity, while some other systems such as Windows
# keep them separate.  In the first situation, we have to verify
# that GDB does not randomly select the wrong instance, even when
# a specific filename is used to qualified the lookup.  And in the
# second case, we have to verify that GDB does select the instance
# defined in the given filename.
#
# To avoid adding target-specific code in this testcase, the program
# sets two local variable named 'v1' and 'v2' with the value of
# our global variables.  This allows us to compare the value that
# GDB returns for each query against the actual value seen by
# the program itself.

# Get past the initialization of variables 'v1' and 'v2'.
