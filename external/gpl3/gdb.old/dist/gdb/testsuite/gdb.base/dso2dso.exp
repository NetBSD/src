# The purpose of this testcase is to verify that we can "next" over
# a call to a function provided by one shared library made from another
# shared library, and that GDB stops at the expected location. In this
# case, the call is made from sub1 (provided by libdso1) and we are
# calling sub2 (provided by libdso2).
#
# Note that, while this is not the main purpose of this testcase, it
# also happens to exercise an issue with displaced stepping on amd64
# when libdso1 is mapped at an address greater than 0xffffffff.
