#    In the spirit of constvars.exp: added volatile, const-volatile stuff.

# This file is part of the gdb testsuite
# Tests for:
#           volatile vars
#           pointers to volatile vars
#           const volatile vars
#           pointers to const volatile vars
#           const pointers to volatile vars
#           volatile pointers to const vars
#           const volatile pointers to const vars
#           const volatile pointers to volatile vars
#           ... etc.  (you get the idea)
# Mostly with char and unsigned char.
