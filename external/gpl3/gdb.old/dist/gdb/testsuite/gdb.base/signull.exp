# Check that GDB can trigger and backtrace SIGSEGV signal stacks
# caused by both accessing (data) and executing (code) at address
# zero.

# On function descriptor architectures, a zero descriptor, instead of
# a NULL pointer, is used.  That way the NULL code test always
# contains a zero code reference.

# For recovery, sigjmp/longjmp are used.

# This also tests backtrace/gdb1476.
