# Make an inferior call to a function which uses longjmp.  However,
# the backtrace for the function that is called is broken at the point
# where the longjmp is handled.  This test is checking to see if the
# inferior call still completes successfully.
#
# This test forces a broken backtrace using Python, but in real life a
# broken backtrace can easily occur when calling through code for
# which there is no debug information if the prologue unwinder fails,
# which can often happen if the code has been optimized.
#
# The problem was that, due to the broken backtrace, GDB failed to
# find the inferior call's dummy frame.  GDB then concluded that the
# inferior had longjmp'd backward past the dummy frame and so garbage
# collected the dummy frame, this causes the breakpoint within the
# dummy frame to be deleted.
#
# When the inferior continued, and eventually returned to the dummy
# frame, it would try to execute instruction from the dummy frame
# (which for most, or even all, targets, is on the stack), and then
# experience undefined behaviuor, often a SIGSEGV.
