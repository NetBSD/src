# This file is part of the gdb testsuite.

# It's possible to have a program that contains two compilation units
# for the same source file name, that have code at different lines.
# For example, in this test, we compile expand-psymtabs.c twice with
# different preprocessor symbols #defined; the first .o only has
# 'main' at some earlier source lines, while the second .o only has
# 'foo' at later source lines.  So when setting breakpoints by line
# number, which full symtab we need depends on the line number in
# question.
#
# This test is meant to verify that, even with lazy partial symtab
# reading in effect, GDB can set breakpoints by line number
# successfully in either compilation unit.
