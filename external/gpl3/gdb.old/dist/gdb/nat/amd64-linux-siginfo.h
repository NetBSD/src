/* When GDB is built as a 64-bit application on Linux, the
   PTRACE_GETSIGINFO data is always presented in 64-bit layout.  Since
   debugging a 32-bit inferior with a 64-bit GDB should look the same
   as debugging it with a 32-bit GDB, we do the 32-bit <-> 64-bit
   conversion in-place ourselves.
   In other to make this conversion independent of the system where gdb
   is compiled the most complete version of the siginfo, named as native
   siginfo, is used internally as an intermediate step.

   Conversion using nat_siginfo is exemplified below:
   compat_siginfo_from_siginfo or compat_x32_siginfo_from_siginfo

      buffer (from the kernel) -> nat_siginfo -> 32 / X32 siginfo

   siginfo_from_compat_x32_siginfo or siginfo_from_compat_siginfo

     32 / X32 siginfo -> nat_siginfo -> buffer (to the kernel)  */
