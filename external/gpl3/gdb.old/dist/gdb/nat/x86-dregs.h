/* Support for hardware watchpoints and breakpoints using the x86
   debug registers.

   This provides several functions for inserting and removing
   hardware-assisted breakpoints and watchpoints, testing if one or
   more of the watchpoints triggered and at what address, checking
   whether a given region can be watched, etc.

   The functions below implement debug registers sharing by reference
   counts, and allow to watch regions up to 16 bytes long
   (32 bytes on 64 bit hosts).  */
