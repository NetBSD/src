/* An address map is essentially a table mapping CORE_ADDRs onto GDB
   data structures, like blocks, symtabs, partial symtabs, and so on.
   An address map uses memory proportional to the number of
   transitions in the map, where a CORE_ADDR N is mapped to one
   object, and N+1 is mapped to a different object.

   Address maps come in two flavors: fixed, and mutable.  Mutable
   address maps consume more memory, but can be changed and extended.
   A fixed address map, once constructed (from a mutable address map),
   can't be edited.  */

/* The type of a function used to iterate over the map.
   OBJ is NULL for unmapped regions.  */
typedef gdb::function_view<int (CORE_ADDR start_addr, void *obj)>

/* The base class for addrmaps.  */

  virtual ~addrmap () = default;

  /* In the mutable address map MAP, associate the addresses from START
     to END_INCLUSIVE that are currently associated with NULL with OBJ
     instead.  Addresses mapped to an object other than NULL are left
     unchanged.

     As the name suggests, END_INCLUSIVE is also mapped to OBJ.  This
     convention is unusual, but it allows callers to accurately specify
     ranges that abut the top of the address space, and ranges that
     cover the entire address space.

     This operation seems a bit complicated for a primitive: if it's
     needed, why not just have a simpler primitive operation that sets a
     range to a value, wiping out whatever was there before, and then
     let the caller construct more complicated operations from that,
     along with some others for traversal?

     It turns out this is the mutation operation we want to use all the
     time, at least for now.  Our immediate use for address maps is to
     represent lexical blocks whose address ranges are not contiguous.
     We walk the tree of lexical blocks present in the debug info, and
     only create 'struct block' objects after we've traversed all a
     block's children.  If a lexical block declares no local variables
     (and isn't the lexical block for a function's body), we omit it
     from GDB's data structures entirely.

     However, this means that we don't decide to create a block (and
     thus record it in the address map) until after we've traversed its
     children.  If we do decide to create the block, we do so at a time
     when all its children have already been recorded in the map.  So
     this operation --- change only those addresses left unset --- is
     actually the operation we want to use every time.

     It seems simpler to let the code which operates on the
     representation directly deal with the hair of implementing these
     semantics than to provide an interface which allows it to be
     implemented efficiently, but doesn't reveal too much of the
     representation.  */
