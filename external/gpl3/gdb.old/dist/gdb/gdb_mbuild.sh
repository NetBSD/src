Usage: gdb_mbuild.sh [ <options> ... ] <srcdir> <builddir>
 Options:
   -j <makejobs>  Run <makejobs> in parallel.  Passed to make.
	          On a single cpu machine, 2 is recommended.
   -k             Keep going.  Do not stop after the first build fails.
   --keep         Keep builds.  Do not remove each build when finished.
   -e <regexp>    Regular expression for selecting the targets to build.
   -f             Force rebuild.  Even rebuild previously built directories.
   -v             Be more (and more, and more) verbose.
 Arguments:
   <srcdir>       Source code directory.
   <builddir>     Build directory.
 Environment variables examined (with default if not defined):
