/* The Solaris signal trampolines reside in libc.  For normal signals,
   the function `sigacthandler' is used.  This signal trampoline will
   call the signal handler using the System V calling convention,
   where the third argument is a pointer to an instance of
   `ucontext_t', which has a member `uc_mcontext' that contains the
   saved registers.  Incidentally, the kernel passes the `ucontext_t'
   pointer as the third argument of the signal trampoline too, and
   `sigacthandler' simply passes it on.  However, if you link your
   program with "-L/usr/ucblib -R/usr/ucblib -lucb", the function
   `ucbsigvechandler' will be used, which invokes the using the BSD
   convention, where the third argument is a pointer to an instance of
   `struct sigcontext'.  It is the `ucbsigvechandler' function that
   converts the `ucontext_t' to a `sigcontext', and back.  Unless the
   signal handler modifies the `struct sigcontext' we can safely
   ignore this.  */
