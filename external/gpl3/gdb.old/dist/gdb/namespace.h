/* This struct is designed to store data from using directives.  It
   says that names from namespace IMPORT_SRC should be visible within
   namespace IMPORT_DEST.  These form a linked list; NEXT is the next
   element of the list.  If the imported namespace or declaration has
   been aliased within the IMPORT_DEST namespace, ALIAS is set to a
   string representing the alias.  Otherwise, ALIAS is NULL.
   DECLARATION is the name of the imported declaration, if this import
   statement represents one.  Otherwise DECLARATION is NULL and this
   import statement represents a namespace.

   C++:      using namespace A;
   Fortran:  use A
   import_src = "A"
   import_dest = local scope of the import statement even such as ""
   alias = NULL
   declaration = NULL
   excludes = NULL

   C++:      using A::x;
   Fortran:  use A, only: x
   import_src = "A"
   import_dest = local scope of the import statement even such as ""
   alias = NULL
   declaration = "x"
   excludes = NULL
   The declaration will get imported as import_dest::x.

   C++ has no way to import all names except those listed ones.
   Fortran:  use A, localname => x
   import_src = "A"
   import_dest = local scope of the import statement even such as ""
   alias = "localname"
   declaration = "x"
   excludes = NULL
   +
   import_src = "A"
   import_dest = local scope of the import statement even such as ""
   alias = NULL
   declaration = NULL
   excludes = ["x"]
   All the entries of A get imported except of "x".  "x" gets imported as
   "localname".  "x" is not defined as a local name by this statement.

   C++:      namespace LOCALNS = A;
   Fortran has no way to address non-local namespace/module.
   import_src = "A"
   import_dest = local scope of the import statement even such as ""
   alias = "LOCALNS"
   declaration = NULL
   excludes = NULL
   The namespace will get imported as the import_dest::LOCALNS
   namespace.

   C++ cannot express it, it would be something like: using localname
   = A::x;
   Fortran:  use A, only localname => x
   import_src = "A"
   import_dest = local scope of the import statement even such as ""
   alias = "localname"
   declaration = "x"
   excludes = NULL
   The declaration will get imported as localname or
   `import_dest`localname.  */
