/* This include file defines the interface between the main part
   of the debugger, and the part which is target-specific, or
   specific to the communications interface between us and the
   target.

   A TARGET is an interface between the debugger and a particular
   kind of file or process.  Targets can be STACKED in STRATA,
   so that more than one target can potentially respond to a request.
   In particular, memory accesses will walk down the stack of targets
   until they find a target that is interested in handling that particular
   address.  STRATA are artificial boundaries on the stack, within
   which particular kinds of targets live.  Strata exist so that
   people don't get confused by pushing e.g. a process target and then
   a file target, and wondering why they can't see the current values
   of variables any more (the file target is handling them and they
   never get to the process target).  So when you push a file target,
   it goes into the file stratum, which is always below the process
   stratum.

   Note that rather than allow an empty stack, we always have the
   dummy target at the bottom stratum, so we can call the target
   methods without checking them.  */

/* GDB's current model is that there are three "kinds" of watchpoints,
   with respect to when they trigger and how you can move past them.

   Those are: continuable, steppable, and non-steppable.

   Continuable watchpoints are like x86's -- those trigger after the
   memory access's side effects are fully committed to memory.  I.e.,
   they trap with the PC pointing at the next instruction already.
   Continuing past such a watchpoint is doable by just normally
   continuing, hence the name.

   Both steppable and non-steppable watchpoints trap before the memory
   access.  I.e, the PC points at the instruction that is accessing
   the memory.  So GDB needs to single-step once past the current
   instruction in order to make the access effective and check whether
   the instruction's side effects change the watched expression.

   Now, in order to step past that instruction, depending on
   architecture and target, you can have two situations:

   - steppable watchpoints: you can single-step with the watchpoint
     still armed, and the watchpoint won't trigger again.

   - non-steppable watchpoints: if you try to single-step with the
     watchpoint still armed, you'd trap the watchpoint again and the
     thread wouldn't make any progress.  So GDB needs to temporarily
     remove the watchpoint in order to step past it.

   If your target/architecture does not signal that it has either
   steppable or non-steppable watchpoints via either
   target_have_steppable_watchpoint or
   gdbarch_have_nonsteppable_watchpoint, GDB assumes continuable
   watchpoints.  */
