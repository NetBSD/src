/* Save/restore the signal actions of all signals, and the signal
   mask.

   Since the exec family of functions does not reset the signal
   disposition of signals set to SIG_IGN, nor does it reset the signal
   mask, in order to be transparent, when spawning new child processes
   to debug (with "run", etc.), we must reset signal actions and mask
   back to what was originally inherited from gdb/gdbserver's parent,
   just before execing the target program to debug.  */
