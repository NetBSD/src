   a ptraced process has changed.  Earlier versions of the kernel
   would ignore these SIGSTOPs, while now SIGSTOP is treated like any
   other signal, i.e. it is not muffled.

   If the gdb user does a 'continue' after the 'attach', gdb passes
   the global variable stop_signal (which stores the signal from the
   attach, SIGSTOP) to the ptrace(PTRACE_CONT,...)  call.  This is
   problematic, because the kernel doesn't ignore such SIGSTOP
   now.  I.e. it is reported back to gdb, which in turn presents it
   back to the user.

   To avoid the problem, we use STOP_QUIETLY_NO_SIGSTOP, which allows
   gdb to clear the value of stop_signal after the attach, so that it
   is not passed back down to the kernel.  */

   inferior, as does each attachment to an existing process.
   Inferiors have unique internal identifiers that are different from
   target process ids.  Each inferior may in turn have multiple
   threads running in it.

   Inferiors are intrusively refcounted objects.  Unlike thread
   objects, being the user-selected inferior is considered a strong
   reference and is thus accounted for in the inferior object's
   refcount (see set_current_inferior).  When GDB needs to remember
   the selected inferior to later restore it, GDB temporarily bumps
   the inferior object's refcount, to prevent something deleting the
   inferior object before reverting back (e.g., due to a
   "remove-inferiors" command (see
