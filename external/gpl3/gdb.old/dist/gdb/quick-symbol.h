   The quick symbol functions are generally opaque: the underlying
   representation is hidden from the caller.

   index the symbol reader creates -- looking through the symbol
   tables themselves is handled by generic code.  If a function is
   defined as returning a "symbol table", this means that the function
   should only return a newly-created symbol table; it should not
   examine pre-existing ones.
