  /* Whether resumed threads must be committed to the target.

     When true, resumed threads must be committed to the execution
     target.

     When false, the target may leave resumed threads stopped when
     it's convenient or efficient to do so.  When the core requires
     resumed threads to be committed again, this is set back to true
     and calls the `commit_resumed` method to allow the target to do
     so.

     To simplify the implementation of targets, the following methods
     are guaranteed to be called with COMMIT_RESUMED_STATE set to
     false:

       - resume
       - stop
       - wait

     Knowing this, the target doesn't need to implement different
     behaviors depending on the COMMIT_RESUMED_STATE, and can simply
     assume that it is false.

     Targets can take advantage of this to batch resumption requests,
     for example.  In that case, the target doesn't actually resume in
     its `resume` implementation.  Instead, it takes note of the
     resumption intent in `resume` and defers the actual resumption to
     `commit_resumed`.  For example, the remote target uses this to
     coalesce multiple resumption requests in a single vCont
     packet.  */

     we need to do quite frequently in the hot path, maintaining this list
