   The set of breakpoints being stepped over will normally be much
   smaller than the set of all breakpoints, so a flag in the

   also saves complexity and run-time, as otherwise we'd have to go
   through all breakpoint locations clearing their flag whenever we
   start a new sequence.  Similar considerations weigh against storing
   this info in the thread object.  Plus, not all step overs actually

/* Displaced stepping.  */

/* In non-stop debugging mode, we must take special care to manage
   breakpoints properly; in particular, the traditional strategy for
   stepping a thread past a breakpoint it has hit is unsuitable.
   'Displaced stepping' is a tactic for stepping one thread past a
   breakpoint it has hit while ensuring that other threads running
   concurrently will hit the breakpoint as they should.

   The traditional way to step a thread T off a breakpoint in a
   multi-threaded program in all-stop mode is as follows:

   a0) Initially, all threads are stopped, and breakpoints are not
       inserted.
   a1) We single-step T, leaving breakpoints uninserted.
   a2) We insert breakpoints, and resume all threads.

   In non-stop debugging, however, this strategy is unsuitable: we
   don't want to have to stop all threads in the system in order to
   continue or step T past a breakpoint.  Instead, we use displaced
   stepping:

   n0) Initially, T is stopped, other threads are running, and
       breakpoints are inserted.
   n1) We copy the instruction "under" the breakpoint to a separate
       location, outside the main code stream, making any adjustments
       to the instruction, register, and memory state as directed by
       T's architecture.
   n2) We single-step T over the instruction at its new location.
   n3) We adjust the resulting register and memory state as directed
       by T's architecture.  This includes resetting T's PC to point
       back into the main instruction stream.
   n4) We resume T.

   This approach depends on the following gdbarch methods:

   - gdbarch_max_insn_length and gdbarch_displaced_step_location
     indicate where to copy the instruction, and how much space must
     be reserved there.  We use these in step n1.

   - gdbarch_displaced_step_copy_insn copies a instruction to a new
     address, and makes any necessary adjustments to the instruction,
     register contents, and memory.  We use this in step n1.

   - gdbarch_displaced_step_fixup adjusts registers and memory after
     we have successfully single-stepped the instruction, to yield the
     same effect the instruction would have had if we had executed it
     at its original address.  We use this in step n3.

   The gdbarch_displaced_step_copy_insn and
   gdbarch_displaced_step_fixup functions must be written so that
   copying an instruction with gdbarch_displaced_step_copy_insn,
   single-stepping across the copied instruction, and then applying
   gdbarch_displaced_insn_fixup should have the same effects on the
   thread's memory and registers as stepping the instruction in place
   would have.  Exactly which responsibilities fall to the copy and
   which fall to the fixup is up to the author of those functions.

   See the comments in gdbarch.sh for details.

   Note that displaced stepping and software single-step cannot
   currently be used in combination, although with some care I think
   they could be made to.  Software single-step works by placing
   breakpoints on all possible subsequent instructions; if the
   displaced instruction is a PC-relative jump, those breakpoints
   could fall in very strange places --- on pages that aren't
   executable, or at addresses that are not proper instruction
   boundaries.  (We do generally let other threads run while we wait
   to hit the software single-step breakpoint, and they might
   encounter such a corrupted instruction.)  One way to work around
   this would be to have gdbarch_displaced_step_copy_insn fully
   simulate the effect of PC-relative instructions (and return NULL)
   on architectures that use software single-stepping.

   In non-stop mode, we can have independent and simultaneous step
   requests, so more than one thread may need to simultaneously step
   over a breakpoint.  The current implementation assumes there is
   only one scratch space per process.  In this case, we have to
   serialize access to the scratch space.  If thread A wants to step
   over a breakpoint, but we are currently waiting for some other
   thread to complete a displaced step, we leave thread A stopped and
   place it in the displaced_step_request_queue.  Whenever a displaced
   step finishes, we pick the next thread in the queue and start a new
   displaced step operation on it.  See displaced_step_prepare and
   displaced_step_finish for details.  */

     Note that if the target_resume interface was more flexible, we could be

     2.1 and 3.2 are both waiting for a vfork-done event.  Then we could ask the
     target(s) to resume:

      - All threads of inferior 1
      - Thread 2.1
      - Thread 3.2

     Since we don't have that flexibility (we can only pass one ptid), just

     Say you're stopped at 0x08000003 as above.  Reverse continuing
