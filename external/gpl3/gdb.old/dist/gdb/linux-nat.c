/* This comment documents high-level logic of this file.

Waiting for events in sync mode
===============================

When waiting for an event in a specific thread, we just use waitpid,
passing the specific pid, and not passing WNOHANG.

When waiting for an event in all threads, waitpid is not quite good:

- If the thread group leader exits while other threads in the thread
  group still exist, waitpid(TGID, ...) hangs.  That waitpid won't
  return an exit status until the other threads in the group are
  reaped.

- When a non-leader thread execs, that thread just vanishes without
  reporting an exit (so we'd hang if we waited for it explicitly in
  that case).  The exec event is instead reported to the TGID pid.

The solution is to always use -1 and WNOHANG, together with
sigsuspend.

First, we use non-blocking waitpid to check for events.  If nothing is
found, we use sigsuspend to wait for SIGCHLD.  When SIGCHLD arrives,
it means something happened to a child process.  As soon as we know
there's an event, we get back to calling nonblocking waitpid.

Note that SIGCHLD should be blocked between waitpid and sigsuspend
calls, so that we don't miss a signal.  If SIGCHLD arrives in between,
when it's blocked, the signal becomes pending and sigsuspend
immediately notices it and returns.

Waiting for events in async mode (TARGET_WNOHANG)
=================================================

In async mode, GDB should always be ready to handle both user input
and target events, so neither blocking waitpid nor sigsuspend are
viable options.  Instead, we should asynchronously notify the GDB main
event loop whenever there's an unprocessed event from the target.  We
detect asynchronous target events by handling SIGCHLD signals.  To
notify the event loop about target events, an event pipe is used
--- the pipe is registered as waitable event source in the event loop,
the event loop select/poll's on the read end of this pipe (as well on
other event sources, e.g., stdin), and the SIGCHLD handler marks the
event pipe to raise an event.  This is more portable than relying on
pselect/ppoll, since on kernels that lack those syscalls, libc
emulates them with select/poll+sigprocmask, and that is racy
(a.k.a. plain broken).

Obviously, if we fail to notify the event loop if there's a target
event, it's bad.  OTOH, if we notify the event loop when there's no
event from the target, linux_nat_wait will detect that there's no real
event to report, and return event of type TARGET_WAITKIND_IGNORE.
This is mostly harmless, but it will waste time and is better avoided.

The main design point is that every time GDB is outside linux-nat.c,
we have a SIGCHLD handler installed that is called when something
happens to the target and notifies the GDB event loop.  Whenever GDB
core decides to handle the event, and calls into linux-nat.c, we
process things as in sync mode, except that the we never block in
sigsuspend.

While processing an event, we may end up momentarily blocked in
waitpid calls.  Those waitpid calls, while blocking, are guarantied to
return quickly.  E.g., in all-stop mode, before reporting to the core
that an LWP hit a breakpoint, all LWPs are stopped by sending them
SIGSTOP, and synchronously waiting for the SIGSTOP to be reported.
Note that this is different from blocking indefinitely waiting for the
next event --- here, we're already handling an event.

Use of signals
==============

We stop threads by sending a SIGSTOP.  The use of SIGSTOP instead of another
signal is not entirely significant; we just need for a signal to be delivered,
so that we can intercept it.  SIGSTOP's advantage is that it can not be
blocked.  A disadvantage is that it is not a real-time signal, so it can only
be queued once; we do not keep track of other sources of SIGSTOP.

Two other signals that can't be blocked are SIGCONT and SIGKILL.  But we can't
use them, because they have special behavior when the signal is generated -
not when it is delivered.  SIGCONT resumes the entire thread group and SIGKILL
kills the entire thread group.

A delivered SIGSTOP would stop the entire thread group, not just the thread we
tkill'd.  But we never let the SIGSTOP be delivered; we always intercept and 
cancel it (by PTRACE_CONT without passing SIGSTOP).

We could use a real-time signal instead.  This would solve those problems; we
could use PTRACE_GETSIGINFO to locate the specific stop signals sent by GDB.
But we would still have to have some support for SIGSTOP, since PTRACE_ATTACH
generates it, and there are races with trying to find a signal that is not
blocked.

Exec events
===========

The case of a thread group (process) with 3 or more threads, and a
thread other than the leader execs is worth detailing:

On an exec, the Linux kernel destroys all threads except the execing
one in the thread group, and resets the execing thread's tid to the
tgid.  No exit notification is sent for the execing thread -- from the
ptracer's perspective, it appears as though the execing thread just
vanishes.  Until we reap all other threads except the leader and the
execing thread, the leader will be zombie, and the execing thread will
be in `D (disc sleep)' state.  As soon as all other threads are
reaped, the execing thread changes its tid to the tgid, and the
previous (zombie) leader vanishes, giving place to the "new"
leader.  */

	     with pthread_exit.  Since we can't reap the leader's exit
	     status until all other threads are gone and reaped too,
	     we want to delete the zombie leader right away, as it
	     can't be debugged, we can't read its registers, etc.
	     This is the main reason we check for zombie leaders
	     disappearing.

	     #2 - The whole thread-group/process exited (a group exit,
	     via e.g. exit(3), and there is (or will be shortly) an
	     exit reported for each thread in the process, and then
	     finally an exit for the leader once the non-leaders are
	     reaped.

	     #3 - There are 3 or more threads in the group, and a
	     thread other than the leader exec'd.  See comments on
	     exec events at the top of the file.

	     Ideally we would never delete the leader for case #2.
	     Instead, we want to collect the exit status of each
	     non-leader thread, and then finally collect the exit
	     status of the leader as normal and use its exit code as
	     whole-process exit code.  Unfortunately, there's no
	     race-free way to distinguish cases #1 and #2.  We can't
	     assume the exit events for the non-leaders threads are
	     already pending in the kernel, nor can we assume the
	     non-leader threads are in zombie state already.  Between
	     the leader becoming zombie and the non-leaders exiting
	     and becoming zombie themselves, there's a small time
	     window, so such a check would be racy.  Temporarily
	     pausing all threads and checking to see if all threads
	     exit or not before re-resuming them would work in the
	     case that all threads are running right now, but it
	     wouldn't work if some thread is currently already
	     ptrace-stopped, e.g., due to scheduler-locking.

	     So what we do is we delete the leader anyhow, and then
	     later on when we see its exit status, we re-add it back.
	     We also make sure that we only report a whole-process
	     exit when we see the leader exiting, as opposed to when
	     the last LWP in the LWP list exits, which can be a
	     non-leader if we deleted the leader here.  */

   memory of different inferiors, to minimize number of file
   descriptors open, which can otherwise run into resource limits.
   However, that does not work correctly -- if the inferior execs and
   we haven't processed the exec event yet, and, we opened a
   /proc/PID/mem file, we will get a mem file accessing the post-exec
   address space, thinking we're opening it for the pre-exec address
   space.  That is dangerous as we can poke memory (e.g. clearing
   breakpoints) in the post-exec memory by mistake, corrupting the
   inferior.  For that reason, we open the mem file as early as
   possible, right after spawning, forking or attaching to the
   inferior, when the inferior is stopped and thus before it has a
   chance of execing.

   Note that after opening the file, even if the thread we opened it
   for subsequently exits, the open file is still usable for accessing
   memory.  It's only when the whole process exits or execs that the
