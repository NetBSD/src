/* * \page gdbtypes GDB Types

   GDB represents all the different kinds of types in programming
   languages using a common representation defined in gdbtypes.h.

   The main data structure is main_type; it consists of a code (such
   as #TYPE_CODE_ENUM for enumeration types), a number of
   generally-useful fields such as the printable name, and finally a
   field main_type::type_specific that is a union of info specific to
   particular languages or other special cases (such as calling
   convention).

   The available type codes are defined in enum #type_code.  The enum
   includes codes both for types that are common across a variety
   of languages, and for types that are language-specific.

   Most accesses to type fields go through macros such as
   #TYPE_CODE(thistype) and #TYPE_FN_FIELD_CONST(thisfn, n).  These are
   written such that they can be used as both rvalues and lvalues.

       Regardless of the language, GDB represents multidimensional
       array types the way C does: as arrays of arrays.  So an
       instance of a GDB array type T can always be seen as a series
       of instances of TYPE_TARGET_TYPE (T) laid out sequentially in
       memory.

       Row-major languages like C lay out multi-dimensional arrays so
       that incrementing the rightmost index in a subscripting
       expression results in the smallest change in the address of the
       element referred to.  Column-major languages like Fortran lay
       them out so that incrementing the leftmost index results in the
       smallest change.

       This means that, in column-major languages, working our way
       from type to target type corresponds to working through indices
       from right to left, not left to right.  */

     bytes, to preserve alignment.  A `struct type' representing such

     There's a bit of a host/target mess here, if you're concerned
     about machines whose bytes aren't eight bits long, or who don't
     have byte-addressed memory.  Various places pass this to memcpy
     and such, meaning it must be in units of host bytes.  Various
     other places expect they can calculate addresses by adding it
     and such, meaning it must be in units of target bytes.  For
     some DSP targets, in which HOST_CHAR_BIT will (presumably) be 8
     and TARGET_CHAR_BIT will be (say) 32, this is a problem.

     One fix would be to make this field in bits (requiring that it
     always be a multiple of HOST_CHAR_BIT and TARGET_CHAR_BIT) ---
     the other choice would be to make it consistently in units of
     HOST_CHAR_BIT.  However, this would still fail to address
