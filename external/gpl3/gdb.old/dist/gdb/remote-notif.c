/* Remote async notification is sent from remote target over RSP.
   Each type of notification is represented by an object of
   'struct notif', which has a field 'pending_reply'.  It is not
   NULL when GDB receives a notification from GDBserver, but hasn't
   acknowledge yet.  Before GDB acknowledges the notification,
   GDBserver shouldn't send notification again (see the header comments
   in gdbserver/notif.c).

   Notifications are processed in an almost-unified approach for both
   all-stop mode and non-stop mode, except the timing to process them.
   In non-stop mode, notifications are processed in
   remote_async_get_pending_events_handler, while in all-stop mode,
   they are processed in remote_resume.  */

	     See details in the function comment of
	     remote.c:remote_notif_get_pending_events.

	     In all-stop, GDB may be blocked to wait for the reply, we
	     shouldn't return to event loop until the expected reply
	     arrives.  For example:

	     1.1) --> vCont;c
	       GDB expects getting stop reply 'T05 thread:2'.
	     1.2) <-- %Notif
	       <GDB marks the REMOTE_ASYNC_GET_PENDING_EVENTS_TOKEN>

	     After step #1.2, we return to the event loop, which
	     notices there is a new event on the
	     REMOTE_ASYNC_GET_PENDING_EVENTS_TOKEN and calls the
	     handler, which will send 'vNotif' packet.
	     1.3) --> vNotif
	     It is not safe to start a new sequence, because target
	     is still running and GDB is expecting the stop reply
	     from stub.

	     To solve this, whenever we parse a notification
	     successfully, we don't mark the
	     REMOTE_ASYNC_GET_PENDING_EVENTS_TOKEN and let GDB blocked
	     there as before to get the sequence done.

	     2.1) --> vCont;c
	       GDB expects getting stop reply 'T05 thread:2'
	     2.2) <-- %Notif
	       <Don't mark the REMOTE_ASYNC_GET_PENDING_EVENTS_TOKEN>
	     2.3) <-- T05 thread:2

	     These pending notifications can be processed later.  */
