   START is the offset from RL_LINE_BUFFER where TEXT starts.  END is
   the offset from RL_LINE_BUFFER where TEXT ends (i.e., where
   rl_point is).

   You should thus pretend that the line ends at END (relative to
   RL_LINE_BUFFER).

   RL_LINE_BUFFER contains the entire text of the line.  RL_POINT is
   the offset in that line of the cursor.  You should pretend that the
   line ends at POINT.
