     This function is designed to be called iteratively.  While
     processing a thread ID range list, at each call it will return
     (in the INF_NUM and THR_NUM output parameters) the next thread ID
     in the range (irrespective of whether the thread actually
     exists).

     At the beginning of parsing a thread range, the char pointer
     PARSER->m_cur_tok will be advanced past <thread_number1> and left
     pointing at the '-' token.  Subsequent calls will not advance the
     pointer until the range is completed.  The call that completes
     the range will advance the pointer past <thread_number2>.

     This function advances through the input string for as long you
     call it.  Once the end of the input string is reached, a call to
     finished returns false (see below).

     E.g., with list: "1.2 3.4-6":

     1st call: *INF_NUM=1; *THR_NUM=2 (finished==0)
     2nd call: *INF_NUM=3; *THR_NUM=4 (finished==0)
     3rd call: *INF_NUM=3; *THR_NUM=5 (finished==0)

     a single thread ID.

     If the next element in the list is a single thread ID, then
     *THR_START and *THR_END are set to the same value.

     E.g.,. with list: "1.2 3.4-6"

     1st call: *INF_NUM=1; *THR_START=2; *THR_END=2 (finished==0)
