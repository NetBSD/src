/* An accessor class that is used by registry_key.

   Normally, a container class has a registry<> field named
   "registry_fields".  In this case, the default accessor is used, as
   it simply returns the object.

   However, a container may sometimes need to store the registry
   elsewhere.  In this case, registry_accessor can be specialized to
   perform the needed indirection.  */

/* In gdb, sometimes there is a need for one module (e.g., the Python
   Type code) to attach some data to another object (e.g., an
   objfile); but it's also desirable that this be done such that the
   base object (the objfile in this example) not need to know anything
   about the attaching module (the Python code).

   This is handled using the registry system.

   A class needing to allow this sort registration can add a registry
   field.  For example, you would write:

   class some_container { registry<some_container> registry_fields; };

   The name of the field matters by default, see registry_accessor.

   A module wanting to attach data to instances of some_container uses
   the "key" class to register a key.  This key can then be passed to
   the "get" and "set" methods to handle this module's data.  */

     convenient to manage, so this template class can be used instead,
     to provide a type-safe interface, that also helps manage the
     lifetime of the stored objects.
