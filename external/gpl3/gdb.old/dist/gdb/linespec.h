   For FLAGS, see decode_line_flags.  DECODE_LINE_LIST_MODE is not

   DEFAULT_SYMTAB and DEFAULT_LINE describe the default location.
   DEFAULT_SYMTAB can be NULL, in which case the current symtab and

   CANONICAL is where the results are stored.  It must not be NULL.

   SELECT_MODE must be one of the multiple_symbols_* constants, or
   NULL.  It determines how multiple results will be handled.  If
   NULL, the appropriate CLI value will be used.

   FILTER can either be NULL or a string holding a canonical name.
   This is only valid when SELECT_MODE is multiple_symbols_all.

   Multiple results are handled differently depending on the
   arguments:

   . With multiple_symbols_cancel, an exception is thrown.

   . With multiple_symbols_ask, a menu is presented to the user.  The
   user may select none, in which case an exception is thrown; or all,
   which is handled like multiple_symbols_all, below.  Otherwise,
   CANONICAL->SALS will have one entry for each name the user chose.

   . With multiple_symbols_all, CANONICAL->SALS will have a single
   entry describing all the matching locations.  If FILTER is
   non-NULL, then only locations whose canonical name is equal (in the
   strcmp sense) to FILTER will be returned; all others will be
   filtered out.  */
