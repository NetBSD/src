   A minimal symbol is a symbol for which there is no direct debug
   information.  For example, for an ELF binary, minimal symbols are
   created from the ELF symbol table.

   For the definition of the minimal symbol structure, see struct
   minimal_symbol in symtab.h.

   Minimal symbols are stored in tables attached to an objfile; see
   objfiles.h for details.  Code should generally treat these tables
   as opaque and use functions provided by minsyms.c to inspect them.
