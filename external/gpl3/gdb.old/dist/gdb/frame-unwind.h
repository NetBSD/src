   use THIS frame, and through it the NEXT frame's register unwind
   method, to determine the frame ID of THIS frame.

   A frame ID provides an invariant that can be used to re-identify an
   instance of a frame.  It is a combination of the frame's `base' and
   the frame's function's code address.

   Traditionally, THIS frame's ID was determined by examining THIS
   frame's function's prologue, and identifying the register/offset
   used as THIS frame's base.

   Example: An examination of THIS frame's prologue reveals that, on
   entry, it saves the PC(+12), SP(+8), and R1(+4) registers
   (decrementing the SP by 12).  Consequently, the frame ID's base can
   be determined by adding 12 to the THIS frame's stack-pointer, and
   the value of THIS frame's SP can be obtained by unwinding the NEXT
   frame's SP.

   THIS_PROLOGUE_CACHE can be used to share any prolog analysis data
   with the other unwind methods.  Memory for that cache should be
   allocated using FRAME_OBSTACK_ZALLOC().  */

/* Assuming the frame chain: (outer) prev <-> this <-> next (inner);
   use THIS frame, and implicitly the NEXT frame's register unwind
   method, to unwind THIS frame's registers (returning the value of
   the specified register REGNUM in the previous frame).

   Traditionally, THIS frame's registers were unwound by examining
   THIS frame's function's prologue and identifying which registers
   that prolog code saved on the stack.

   Example: An examination of THIS frame's prologue reveals that, on
   entry, it saves the PC(+12), SP(+8), and R1(+4) registers
   (decrementing the SP by 12).  Consequently, the value of the PC
   register in the previous frame is found in memory at SP+12, and
   THIS frame's SP can be obtained by unwinding the NEXT frame's SP.

   This function takes THIS_FRAME as an argument.  It can find the
   values of registers in THIS frame by calling get_frame_register
   (THIS_FRAME), and reinvoke itself to find other registers in the
   PREVIOUS frame by calling frame_unwind_register (THIS_FRAME).

   The result is a GDB value object describing the register value.  It
   may be a lazy reference to memory, a lazy reference to the value of
   a register in THIS frame, or a non-lvalue.

   If the previous frame's register was not saved by THIS_FRAME and is
   therefore undefined, return a wholly optimized-out not_lval value.

   THIS_PROLOGUE_CACHE can be used to share any prolog analysis data
   with the other unwind methods.  Memory for that cache should be
   allocated using FRAME_OBSTACK_ZALLOC().  */
