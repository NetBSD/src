   GDB targets (*-tdep.c) can register an interest in a specific

   per-architecture data.

   The mechanisms below ensures that there is only a loose connection
   between the set-architecture command and the various GDB
   components.  Each component can independently register their need
   to maintain architecture specific data with gdbarch.

   Pragmatics:

   Previously, a single TARGET_ARCHITECTURE_HOOK was provided.  It
   didn't scale.

   The more traditional mega-struct containing architecture specific
   data for all the various GDB components was also considered.  Since
   GDB is built from a variable number of (fairly independent)
   components it was determined that the global aproach was not
   applicable.  */


/* Register a new architectural family with GDB.

   Register support for the specified ARCHITECTURE with GDB.  When
   gdbarch determines that the specified architecture has been
   selected, the corresponding INIT function is called.

   --

   The INIT function takes two parameters: INFO which contains the
   information available to gdbarch about the (possibly new)
   architecture; ARCHES which is a list of the previously created
   ``struct gdbarch'' for this architecture.

   The INFO parameter is, as far as possible, be pre-initialized with
   information obtained from INFO.ABFD or the global defaults.

   The ARCHES parameter is a linked list (sorted most recently used)
   of all the previously created architures for this architecture
   family.  The (possibly NULL) ARCHES->gdbarch can used to access
   values from the previously selected architecture for this
   architecture family.

   The INIT function shall return any of: NULL - indicating that it
   doesn't recognize the selected architecture; an existing ``struct
   gdbarch'' from the ARCHES list - indicating that the new
   architecture is just a synonym for an earlier architecture (see
   gdbarch_list_lookup_by_info()); a newly created ``struct gdbarch''
   - that describes the selected architecture (see gdbarch_alloc()).

   The DUMP_TDEP function shall print out all target specific values.
   Care should be taken to ensure that the function works in both the
   multi-arch and non- multi-arch cases.  */
