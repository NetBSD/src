   stacks to commit their resumed threads.

   On construction, set process_stratum_target::commit_resumed_state
   to false for all process_stratum targets in all target
   stacks.

   On destruction (or if reset_and_commit() is called), set
   process_stratum_target::commit_resumed_state to true for all
   process_stratum targets in all target stacks, except those that:

     - have no resumed threads
     - have a resumed thread with a pending status

   target_commit_resumed is not called in the destructor, because its
   implementations could throw, and we don't to swallow that error in
   a destructor.  Instead, the caller should call the
   reset_and_commit_resumed() method so that an eventual exception can
   propagate.  "reset" in the method name refers to the fact that this
   method has the same effect as the destructor, in addition to
   committing resumes.

   The creation of nested scoped_disable_commit_resumed objects is
   tracked, such that only the outermost instance actually does
   something, for cases like this:

     void
     inner_func ()
     {
       scoped_disable_commit_resumed disable;

       // do stuff

       disable.reset_and_commit ();
     }

     void
     outer_func ()
     {
       scoped_disable_commit_resumed disable;

       for (... each thread ...)
	 inner_func ();

       disable.reset_and_commit ();
     }

   In this case, we don't want the `disable` destructor in
   `inner_func` to require targets to commit resumed threads, so that
   the `reset_and_commit()` call in `inner_func` doesn't actually
   resume threads.  */
