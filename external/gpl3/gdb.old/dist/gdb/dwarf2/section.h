/* A descriptor for dwarf sections.

   S.ASECTION, SIZE are typically initialized when the objfile is first
   scanned.  BUFFER, READIN are filled in later when the section is read.
   If the section contained compressed data then SIZE is updated to record
   the uncompressed size of the section.

   DWP file format V2 introduces a wrinkle that is easiest to handle by
   creating the concept of virtual sections contained within a real section.
   In DWP V2 the sections of the input DWO files are concatenated together
   into one section, but section offsets are kept relative to the original
   input section.
   If this is a virtual dwp-v2 section, S.CONTAINING_SECTION is a backlink to
   the real section this "virtual" section is contained in, and BUFFER,SIZE
   describe the virtual section.  */
