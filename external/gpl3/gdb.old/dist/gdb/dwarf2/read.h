     This is also used to work around a difference between the way gold
     generates .gdb_index version <=7 and the way gdb does.  Arguably this
     is a gold bug.  For symbols coming from TUs, gold records in the index
     the CU that includes the TU instead of the TU itself.  This breaks
     dw2_lookup_symbol: It assumes that if the index says symbol X lives
     in CU/TU Y, then one need only expand Y and a subsequent lookup in Y
     will find X.  Alas TUs live in their own symtab, so after expanding CU Y
     we need to look in TU Z to find X.  Fortunately, this is akin to
     DW_TAG_imported_unit, so we just use the same mechanism: For
     .gdb_index version <=7 this also records the TUs that the CU referred
     to.  Concurrently with this change gdb was modified to emit version 8
     indices so we only pay a price for gold generated indices.
