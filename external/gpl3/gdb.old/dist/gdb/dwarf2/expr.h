     Each time DW_OP_piece is executed, we add a new element to the
     end of this array, recording the current top of the stack, the
     current location, and the size given as the operand to
     DW_OP_piece.  We then pop the top value from the stack, reset the
     location, and resume evaluation.

     The Dwarf spec doesn't say whether DW_OP_piece pops the top value
     from the stack.  We do, ensuring that clients of this interface
     expecting to see a value left on the top of the stack (say, code
     evaluating frame base expressions or CFA's specified with
     DW_CFA_def_cfa_expression) will get an error if the expression
     actually marks all the values it computes as pieces.

     If an expression never uses DW_OP_piece, num_pieces will be zero.
     (It would be nice to present these cases as expressions yielding
     a single piece, so that callers need not distinguish between the
     no-DW_OP_piece and one-DW_OP_piece cases.  But expressions with
     no DW_OP_piece operations have no value to place in a piece's
     'size' field; the size comes from the surrounding data.  So the
     two cases need to be handled separately.)  */
