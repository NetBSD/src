/* These globals below are global termcap variables that readline
   references.

   Actually, depending on preprocessor conditions that we don't want
   to mirror here (as they may change depending on readline versions),
   readline may define these globals as well, relying on the linker
   merging them if needed (-fcommon).  That doesn't work with
   -fno-common or C++, so instead we define the symbols as weak.
   Don't do this on Windows though, as MinGW gcc 3.4.2 doesn't support
   weak (later versions, e.g., 4.8, do support it).  Given this stub
   file originally was Windows only, and we only needed this when we
   made it work on other hosts, it should be OK.  */
