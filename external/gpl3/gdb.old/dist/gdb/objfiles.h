/* This structure maintains information on a per-objfile basis about the
   "entry point" of the objfile, and the scope within which the entry point
   exists.  It is possible that gdb will see more than one objfile that is
   executable, each with its own entry point.

   For example, for dynamically linked executables in SVR4, the dynamic linker
   code is contained within the shared C library, which is actually executable
   and is run by the kernel first when an exec is done of a user executable
   that is dynamically linked.  The dynamic linker within the shared C library
   then maps in the various program segments in the user executable and jumps
   to the user executable's recorded entry point, as if the call had been made
   directly by the kernel.

   The traditional gdb method of using this info was to use the
   recorded entry point to set the entry-file's lowpc and highpc from
   the debugging information, where these values are the starting
   address (inclusive) and ending address (exclusive) of the
   instruction space in the executable which correspond to the
   "startup file", i.e. crt0.o in most cases.  This file is assumed to
   be a startup file and frames with pc's inside it are treated as
   nonexistent.  Setting these variables is necessary so that
   backtraces do not fly off the bottom of the stack.

   NOTE: cagney/2003-09-09: It turns out that this "traditional"
   method doesn't work.  Corinna writes: ``It turns out that the call
   to test for "inside entry file" destroys a meaningful backtrace
   under some conditions.  E.g. the backtrace tests in the asm-source
   testcase are broken for some targets.  In this test the functions
   are all implemented as part of one file and the testcase is not
   necessarily linked with a start file (depending on the target).
   What happens is, that the first frame is printed normally and
   following frames are treated as being inside the entry file then.
   This way, only the #0 frame is printed in the backtrace output.''
   Ref "frame.c" "NOTE: vinschen/2003-04-01".

   Gdb also supports an alternate method to avoid running off the bottom
   of the stack.

   There are two frames that are "special", the frame for the function
   containing the process entry point, since it has no predecessor frame,
   and the frame for the function containing the user code entry point
   (the main() function), since all the predecessor frames are for the
   process startup code.  Since we have no guarantee that the linked
   in startup modules have any debugging information that gdb can use,
   we need to avoid following frame pointers back into frames that might
   have been built in the startup code, as we might get hopelessly
   confused.  However, we almost always have debugging information
   available for main().

   These variables are used to save the range of PC values which are
   valid within the main() function and within the function containing
   the process entry point.  If we always consider the frame for
   main() as the outermost frame when debugging user code, and the
   frame for the process entry point function as the outermost frame
   when debugging startup code, then all we have to do is have
   DEPRECATED_FRAME_CHAIN_VALID return false whenever a frame's
   current PC is within the range specified by these variables.  In
   essence, we set "ceilings" in the frame chain beyond which we will
   not proceed when following the frame chain back up the stack.

   A nice side effect is that we can still debug startup code without
   running off the end of the frame chain, assuming that we have usable
   debugging information in the startup modules, and if we choose to not
   use the block at main, or can't find it for some reason, everything
   still works as before.  And if we have no startup code debugging
   information but we do have usable information for main(), backtraces
   from user code don't go wandering off into the startup code.  */
