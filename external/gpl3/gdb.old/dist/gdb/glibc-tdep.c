   1) decides whether a PLT has sent us into the linker to resolve
      a function reference, and 
   2) if so, tells us where to set a temporary breakpoint that will
      trigger when the dynamic linker is done.  */

  /* The GNU dynamic linker is part of the GNU C library, and is used
     by all GNU systems (GNU/Hurd, GNU/Linux).  An unresolved PLT
     entry points to "_dl_runtime_resolve", which calls "fixup" to
     patch the PLT, and then passes control to the function.

     We look for the symbol `_dl_runtime_resolve', and find `fixup' in
     the same objfile.  If we are at the entry point of `fixup', then
     we set a breakpoint at the return address (at the top of the
     stack), and continue.
  
     It's kind of gross to do all these checks every time we're
     called, since they don't change once the executable has gotten
     started.  But this is only a temporary hack --- upcoming versions
     of GNU/Linux will provide a portable, efficient interface for
     debugging programs that use shared libraries.  */
