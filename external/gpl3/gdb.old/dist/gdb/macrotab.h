/* How do we represent a source location?  I mean, how should we
   represent them within GDB; the user wants to use all sorts of
   ambiguous abbreviations, like "break 32" and "break foo.c:32"
   ("foo.c" may have been #included into several compilation units),
   but what do we disambiguate those things to?

   - Answer 1: "Filename and line number."  (Or column number, if
   you're picky.)  That's not quite good enough.  For example, the
   same source file can be #included into several different
   compilation units --- which #inclusion do you mean?

   - Answer 2: "Compilation unit, filename, and line number."  This is
   a pretty good answer; GDB's `struct symtab_and_line' basically
   embodies this representation.  But it's still ambiguous; what if a
   given compilation unit #includes the same file twice --- how can I
   set a breakpoint on line 12 of the fifth #inclusion of "foo.c"?

   - Answer 3: "Compilation unit, chain of #inclusions, and line
   number."  This is analogous to the way GCC reports errors in
   #include files:

        $ gcc -c base.c
        In file included from header2.h:8,
                         from header1.h:3,
                         from base.c:5:
        header3.h:1: parse error before ')' token
        $

   GCC tells you exactly what path of #inclusions led you to the
   problem.  It gives you complete information, in a way that the
   following would not:

        $ gcc -c base.c
        header3.h:1: parse error before ')' token
        $

   Converting all of GDB to use this is a big task, and I'm not really
   suggesting it should be a priority.  But this module's whole
   purpose is to maintain structures describing the macro expansion
   process, so I think it's appropriate for us to take a little care
   to do that in a complete fashion.

   In this interface, the first line of a file is numbered 1, not 0.
   This is the same convention the rest of GDB uses.  */


/* A table of all the macro definitions for a given compilation unit.  */
struct macro_table;

/* The definition of a single macro.  */
struct macro_definition;

/* A source file that participated in a compilation unit --- either a
   main file, or an #included file.  If a file is #included more than
   once, the presence of the `included_from' and `included_at_line'
   members means that we need to make one instance of this structure
   for each #inclusion.  Taken as a group, these structures form a
   tree mapping the #inclusions that contributed to the compilation
   unit, with the main source file as its root.

   Beware --- not every source file mentioned in a compilation unit's
   symtab structures will appear in the #inclusion tree!  As of Oct
   2002, GCC does record the effect of #line directives in the source
   line info, but not in macro info.  This means that GDB's symtabs
   (built from the former, among other things) may mention filenames
   that the #inclusion tree (built from the latter) doesn't have any
   record of.  See macroscope.c:sal_macro_scope for how to accomodate
   this.

   It's worth noting that libcpp has a simpler way of representing all
   this, which we should consider switching to.  It might even be
   suitable for ordinary non-macro line number info.

   Suppose you take your main source file, and after each line
   containing an #include directive you insert the text of the
   #included file.  The result is a big file that pretty much
   corresponds to the full text the compiler's going to see.  There's
   a one-to-one correspondence between lines in the big file and
   per-inclusion lines in the source files.  (Obviously, #include
   directives that are #if'd out don't count.  And you'll need to
   append a newline to any file that doesn't end in one, to avoid
   splicing the last #included line with the next line of the
   #including file.)

   Libcpp calls line numbers in this big imaginary file "logical line
   numbers", and has a data structure called a "line map" that can map
   logical line numbers onto actual source filenames and line numbers,
   and also tell you the chain of #inclusions responsible for any
   particular logical line number.  Basically, this means you can pass
   around a single line number and some kind of "compilation unit"
   object and you get nice, unambiguous source code locations that
   distinguish between multiple #inclusions of the same file, etc.

   Pretty neat, huh?  */
