.SH NAME
gp\-display\-html \- Generate an HTML based directory structure to browse the profiles
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBgprofng display html\fR [\fIoption(s)\fR] \fIexperiment(s)\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Process one or more experiments to generate a directory containing the
\&\fIindex.html\fR file that may be used to browse the experiment data.
.SH OPTIONS
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP \fB\-\-version\fR 4
.IX Item "--version"
Print the version number and exit.
.IP \fB\-\-help\fR 4
.IX Item "--help"
Print usage information and exit.
.IP \fB\-\-verbose\fR 4
.IX Item "--verbose"
Enable verbose mode to show diagnostic messages about the processing of the
data.  By default verbose mode is disabled.
.IP "\fB\-d [\fR\fIdb-vol-size\fR\fB], \-\-debug[=\fR\fIdb-vol-size\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d [db-vol-size], --debug[=db-vol-size]"
Control the printing of run time debug information to assist with the
troubleshooting, or further development of this tool.
.Sp
The \fIdb-vol-size\fR parameter controls the output volume and is one from
the list \fBs\fR, \fBS\fR, \fBm\fR, \fBM\fR, \fBl\fR, \fBL\fR, \fBxl\fR,
or \fBXL\fR.  If \fIdb-vol-size\fR is not set, a modest amount of information
is printed.  This is equivalent to select \fBs\fR, or \fBS\fR.  The volume
of data goes up as the size increases.  Note that currently \fBl/L\fR is
equivalent to \fBxl/XL\fR, but this is expected to change in future updates.
By default debug mode is disabled.
.IP \fB\-\-highlight\-percentage=\fR\fIvalue\fR 4
.IX Item "--highlight-percentage=value"
Set a percentage value in the interval [0,100] to select and color code source
lines, as well as instructions, that are within this percentage of the maximum
metric value(s).  The default is 90 (%).  A value of zero disables this
feature.
.IP "\fB\-o\fR \fIdirname\fR\fB, \-\-output=\fR\fIdirname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o dirname, --output=dirname"
Use \fIdirname\fR as the directory name to store the results in.  In
absence of this option, the default name is \fBdisplay.<n>.html\fR.
This directory is created in the current directory.
The number \fI<n>\fR is the first positive integer number not in use in
this naming scheme.  An existing directory with the same name is not
overwritten.
In case the directory exists already, an error message is printed and
the tool terminates.
.IP "\fB\-O\fR \fIdirname\fR\fB, \-\-overwrite=\fR\fIdirname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-O dirname, --overwrite=dirname"
Use \fIdirname\fR as the directory name to store the results in.  In
absence of this option, the default name is \fBdisplay.<n>.html\fR.
This directory is created in the current directory.
The number \fI<n>\fR is the first positive integer number not in use in
this naming scheme.  An existing directory with the same name is silently
overwritten.
.IP "\fB\-q,  \-\-quiet\fR" 4
.IX Item "-q, --quiet"
Disable the display of all warning, debug, verbose and any other messages.
If enabled, the settings for verbose and debug are accepted, but ignored.
With this option, there is no screen output, other than errors.  By default
quiet mode is disabled.
.IP \fB\-\-nowarnings\fR 4
.IX Item "--nowarnings"
Disable the printing of warning messages on stdout.  By default warning
messages are printed.
.SH NOTES
.IX Header "NOTES"
.IP \- 4
The options and values are case sensitive.
.IP \- 4
In this release, the option syntax has changed to be more compliant with other
tools and commands.
.Sp
The options that used to have an \fBon\fR or \fBoff\fR value only, now act
as a switch.  The option negates the default setting.  For example, by
default, verbose mode is disabled.  It is enabled by using the
\&\fB\-\-verbose\fR option.
.Sp
The long options, those starting with \f(CW\*(C`\-\-\*(C'\fR, that require a value, expect
the \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR sign between the option and the value.
.Sp
While the previous syntax and choices are accepted still, we strongly
recommend to change the usage of the options according to the new syntax
and values.  At some point, these legacy settings may no longer be accepted.
.Sp
To assist with the transition, a warning message is shown if the legacy
syntax, or value, or both, are used.
.IP \- 4
The \fB\-hp\fR option is still accepted, but it will be deprecated in a
future release.  Use the \fB\-\-highlight\-percentage\fR option instead.
.IP \- 4
When setting a directory name for the HTML files to be stored in, make sure
that umask is set to the correct access permissions.
.IP \- 4
Regardless of the setting for the warning messages, if there are warnings, they
are accessible through the main \fIindex.html\fR page.
.IP \- 4
The tool tries to accumulate as many warnings and errors as possible, before
taking action.  In this way, it is easier to address multiple issues at
once.  As a result of this approach, it may be that the messages do not show
immediately.  In particular, warnings are shown towards the end of the
execution, but one or more errors will terminate execution before the
processing begins.
