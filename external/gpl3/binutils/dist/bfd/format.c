SECTION
	File formats

	A format is a BFD concept of high level file contents type. The
	formats supported by BFD are:

	o <<bfd_object>>

	The BFD may contain data, symbols, relocations and debug info.

	o <<bfd_archive>>

	The BFD contains other BFDs and an optional index.

	o <<bfd_core>>

	The BFD contains the result of an executable core dump.

FUNCTION
	bfd_check_format

SYNOPSIS
	bfd_boolean bfd_check_format (bfd *abfd, bfd_format format);

DESCRIPTION
	Verify if the file attached to the BFD @var{abfd} is compatible
	with the format @var{format} (i.e., one of <<bfd_object>>,
	<<bfd_archive>> or <<bfd_core>>).

	If the BFD has been set to a specific target before the
	call, only the named target and format combination is
	checked. If the target has not been set, or has been set to
	<<default>>, then all the known target backends is
	interrogated to determine a match.  If the default target
	matches, it is used.  If not, exactly one target must recognize
	the file, or an error results.

	The function returns <<TRUE>> on success, otherwise <<FALSE>>
	with one of the following error codes:

	o <<bfd_error_invalid_operation>> -
	if <<format>> is not one of <<bfd_object>>, <<bfd_archive>> or
	<<bfd_core>>.

	o <<bfd_error_system_call>> -
	if an error occured during a read - even some file mismatches
	can cause bfd_error_system_calls.

	o <<file_not_recognised>> -
	none of the backends recognised the file format.

	o <<bfd_error_file_ambiguously_recognized>> -
	more than one backend recognised the file format.

	Then the user may choose a format and try again.

	When done with the list that @var{matching} points to, the caller
