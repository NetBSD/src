# This script handles target configuration for gold.  This is shell
# code invoked by the autoconf generated configure script.  Putting
# this in a separate file lets us skip running autoconf when modifying
# target specific information.

# This file switches on the shell variable ${targ}, which is a
# canonicalized GNU configuration triplet.  It sets the following
# shell variables:

# targ_obj               object file to include in the link, with no extension
# targ_extra_obj         extra object file to include
# targ_machine           ELF machine code for this target
# targ_size              size of this target--32 or 64
# targ_extra_size        extra targ_size setting for the target
# targ_big_endian        whether the target is big-endian--true or false
# targ_extra_big_endian  extra targ_big_endian setting for the target

# If the target is not recognized targ_obj is set to "UNKNOWN".
