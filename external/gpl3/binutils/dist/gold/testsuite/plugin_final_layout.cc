// The goal of this program is to verify if section ordering
// via plugins happens correctly.  Also, test if plugin based ordering
// overrides default text section ordering where ".text.hot" sections
// are grouped.  The plugin does not want foo and baz next to each other.
// Plugin section order is foo() followed by bar() and then baz().
