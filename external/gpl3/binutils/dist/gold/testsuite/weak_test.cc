// This provides a set of test functions for TLS variables.  The
// functions are called by a main function in tls_test_main.cc.  This
// lets us test TLS access from a shared library.  We currently don't
// bother to test TLS access between two different files, on the
// theory that that is no more complicated than ordinary variable
// access between files.

// We test that we correctly deal with weak symbols defined in
// other libraries (in this case, libc).  We need to make sure we
// copy the associated GLOBAL reloc when we copy a WEAK reloc.
