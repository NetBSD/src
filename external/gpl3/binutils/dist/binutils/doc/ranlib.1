.SH NAME
ranlib \- generate an index to an archive
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
ranlib [\fB\-\-plugin\fR \fIname\fR] [\fB\-DhHvVt\fR] \fIarchive\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBranlib\fR generates an index to the contents of an archive and
stores it in the archive.  The index lists each symbol defined by a
member of an archive that is a relocatable object file.
.PP
You may use \fBnm \-s\fR or \fBnm \-\-print\-armap\fR to list this index.
.PP
An archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library and
allows routines in the library to call each other without regard to
their placement in the archive.
.PP
The GNU \fBranlib\fR program is another form of GNU \fBar\fR; running
\&\fBranlib\fR is completely equivalent to executing \fBar \-s\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP \fB\-h\fR 4
.IX Item "-h"
.PD 0
.IP \fB\-H\fR 4
.IX Item "-H"
.IP \fB\-\-help\fR 4
.IX Item "--help"
.PD
Show usage information for \fBranlib\fR.
.IP \fB\-v\fR 4
.IX Item "-v"
.PD 0
.IP \fB\-V\fR 4
.IX Item "-V"
.IP \fB\-\-version\fR 4
.IX Item "--version"
.PD
Show the version number of \fBranlib\fR.
.IP \fB\-D\fR 4
.IX Item "-D"
Operate in \fIdeterministic\fR mode.  The symbol map archive member's
header will show zero for the UID, GID, and timestamp.  When this
option is used, multiple runs will produce identical output files.
.Sp
If \fIbinutils\fR was configured with
\&\fB\-\-enable\-deterministic\-archives\fR, then this mode is on by
default.  It can be disabled with the \fB\-U\fR option, described
below.
.IP \fB\-t\fR 4
.IX Item "-t"
Update the timestamp of the symbol map of an archive.
.IP \fB\-U\fR 4
.IX Item "-U"
Do \fInot\fR operate in \fIdeterministic\fR mode.  This is the
inverse of the \fB\-D\fR option, above: the archive index will get
actual UID, GID, timestamp, and file mode values.
.Sp
If \fIbinutils\fR was configured \fIwithout\fR
\&\fB\-\-enable\-deterministic\-archives\fR, then this mode is on by
default.
.IP \fB@\fR\fIfile\fR 4
.IX Item "@file"
Read command-line options from \fIfile\fR.  The options read are
inserted in place of the original @\fIfile\fR option.  If \fIfile\fR
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.
.Sp
Options in \fIfile\fR are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The \fIfile\fR may itself contain additional
@\fIfile\fR options; any such options will be processed recursively.
