@c This file contains the entry for the --ctf, --ctf-parent, --ctf-symbols, -and
@c --ctf-strings options that are common to both readelf and objdump.

@item --ctf=@var{section}
@cindex CTF
@cindex Compact Type Format

Display the contents of the specified CTF section.  CTF sections themselves
contain many subsections, all of which are displayed in order.

@item --ctf-parent=@var{section}

Specify the name of another section from which the CTF dictionary can inherit
types.  (If none is specified, we assume the CTF dictionary inherits types
from the default-named member of the archive contained within this section.)
