/* The required options for a rule are represented with a two-level
   structure, with leaf expressions combined by logical ORs at the
   lower level, and the results then combined by logical ANDs at the
   top level.  The AND terms are linked in a list, and each one can
   contain a reference to a list of OR terms.  The leaf expressions,
   i.e., the OR options, can be negated by setting the is_true field
   to FALSE.  There are two classes of leaf expressions: (1) those
   that are properties of the Xtensa configuration and can be
   evaluated once when building the tables, and (2) those that depend
   of the state of directives or other settings that may vary during
   the assembly.  The following expressions may be used in group (1):

   IsaUse*:	Xtensa configuration settings.
   realnop:	TRUE if the instruction set includes a NOP instruction.

   There are currently no expressions in group (2), but they are still
   supported since there is a good chance they'll be needed again for
   something.  */
