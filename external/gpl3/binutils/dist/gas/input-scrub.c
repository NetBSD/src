/*
 * O/S independent module to supply buffers of sanitised source code
 * to rest of assembler.  We get sanitised input data of arbitrary length.
 * We break these buffers on line boundaries, recombine pieces that
 * were broken across buffers, and return a buffer of full lines to
 * the caller.
 * The last partial line begins the next buffer we build and return to caller.
 * The buffer returned to caller is preceded by BEFORE_STRING and followed
 * by AFTER_STRING, as sentinels. The last character before AFTER_STRING
 * is a newline.
 * Also looks after line numbers, for e.g. error messages.
 */

/*
 * We don't care how filthy our buffers are, but our callers assume
 * that the following sanitation has already been done.
 *
 * No comments, reduce a comment to a space.
 * Reduce a tab to a space unless it is 1st char of line.
 * All multiple tabs and spaces collapsed into 1 char. Tab only
 *   legal if 1st char of line.
 * # line file statements converted to .line x;.file y; statements.
 * Escaped newlines at end of line: remove them but add as many newlines
 *   to end of statement as you removed in the middle, to synch line numbers.
