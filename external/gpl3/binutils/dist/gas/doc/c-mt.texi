@cindex @code{-march=} command line option, MT
@item -march=@var{processor}
This option specifies the target processor.  The assembler will issue an
error message if an attempt is made to assemble an instruction which
will not execute on the target processor.  The following processor names are
recognized: 
@code{ms1-64-001},
@code{ms1-16-002},
@code{ms1-16-003},
and @code{ms2}.

@cindex @code{-nosched} command line option, MT

@cindex line comment character, MT
@cindex MT line comment character
The presence of a @samp{;} appearing anywhere on a line indicates the
start of a comment that extends to the end of that line.

If a @samp{#} appears as the first character of a line then the whole
line is treated as a comment, but in this case the line can also be a
logical line number directive (@pxref{Comments}) or a preprocessor
control command (@pxref{Preprocessing}).

@cindex line separator, MT
@cindex statement separator, MT
@cindex MT line separator
The MT assembler does not currently support a line separator
character.
