# Test for warnings when placing yield instructions into IQ2000's
# branch delay slot.  Written by Ben Elliston (bje@redhat.com)

# Run GAS and check that it emits the desired error for the test case.
# Arguments:
#   file -- name of the test case to assemble.
#   testname -- a string describing the test.
#   pattern -- a regular expression, suitable for use by the Tcl
#     regexp command, to decide if the error string was emitted by
#     the assembler to stderr.
