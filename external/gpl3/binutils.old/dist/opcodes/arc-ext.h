/*This header file defines a table of extensions to the ARC processor
  architecture.  These extensions are read from the '.arcextmap' or
  '.gnu.linkonce.arcextmap.<type>.<N>' sections in the ELF file which
  is identified by the bfd parameter to the build_ARC_extmap function.

  These extensions may include:
	 core registers
	 auxiliary registers
	 instructions
	 condition codes

  Once the table has been constructed, accessor functions may be used
  to retrieve information from it.

  The build_ARC_extmap constructor function build_ARC_extmap may be
  called as many times as required; it will re-initialize the table
  each time.  */
