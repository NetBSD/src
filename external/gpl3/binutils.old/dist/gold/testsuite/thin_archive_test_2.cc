// This tests references between files and archives.  This is file 2 of 4.
// Each of the first three files contains a reference to the next.
// We test the archives as follows:

// Files 1 and 2 in libthin1.a, files 3 and 4 in libthin2.a.
// Files 1 and 4 in libthin3.a, files 2 and 3 in libthin4.a, with
// libthin3.a and libthin4.a nested inside libthinall.a.
