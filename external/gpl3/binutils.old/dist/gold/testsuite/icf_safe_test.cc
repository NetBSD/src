// The goal of this program is to verify if identical code folding
// in safe mode correctly folds only ctors and dtors. kept_func_1 must
// not be folded into kept_func_2 other than for X86 (32 and 64 bit)
// which can use relocation types to determine if function pointers are
// taken.  kept_func_3 should never be folded as its pointer is taken.
// The ctor and dtor of class A must be folded.
