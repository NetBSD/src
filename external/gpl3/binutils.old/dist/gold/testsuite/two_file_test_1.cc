// This tests references between files.  This is file 1, and
// two_file_test_2.cc is file 2.  We test in several different ways:

// Files 1 and 2 linked together in executable.
// File 1 in executable, file 2 in shared library.
// File 1 in shared library, file 2 in executable.
// Files 1 and 2 linked together in shared library.
// Files 1 and 2 in different shared libraries.

// We test the following cases.

// 1  Code in file 1 calls code in file 2.
// 2  Code in file 1 refers to global data in file 2.
// 3  Code in file 1 referes to common symbol in file 2.
// 4  Code in file 1 refers to offset within global data in file 2.
// 5  Code in file 1 refers to offset within common symbol in file 2.
// 6  Data in file 1 refers to global data in file 2.
// 7  Data in file 1 refers to common symbol in file 2.
// 8  Data in file 1 refers to offset within global data in file 2.
// 9  Data in file 1 refers to offset within common symbol in file 2.
// 10 Data in file 1 refers to function in file 2.
// 11 Pass function pointer from file 1 to file 2.
// 12 Compare address of function for equality in both files.
// 13 Compare address of inline function for equality in both files.
// 14 Compare string constants in file 1 and file 2.
// 15 Compare wide string constants in file 1 and file 2.
// 16 Call a function directly after its address has been taken.
// 17 File 1 checks array of string constants defined in file 2.
// 18 File 1 checks string constants referenced in code in file 2.
