Volunteers to tackle some of the following would be welcome:

Support the "traditional" BSD  -A flag (incremental loading).
(There is a -A flag in ld now, but it is used to specify the
architecture.  That should probably be changed.)

Support for dynamic loading (a la dld, but bfd-based) would be nice.

Avoid re-open (and re-seeking) output bfd and archives.
