# Make sure relocations against global and local symbols with relative and
# absolute 32-bit relocs don't come out wrong after ld -r.  Remember that
# SH uses partial_inplace (sort-of REL within RELA) with related confusion
# about how, when, where and which addends to use.  A DSO must have the
# same value in the addend as in the data, so either can be used.
