# Note:
# 
# This test checks the "direct linking to a dll" functionality with stdcall
# and fastcall fixup.
# 
# The test has 7 stages:
# 
# 1. compile and link a test dll with ".dll" extension.
#
# 2. compile and link a test dll with ".sl" (i.e. != ".dll") extension.
#
# 3. compile and link a client application linking directly to the ".dll" dll built in 1.
#    This should produce no errors.
#
# 4. compile and link a client application linking directly to the ".sl" dll built in 2.
#    This should produce no errors.
#
# 5. compile and link a client application linking directly to a symlink into 
#    the ".dll" dll built in 1.
#    This should produce no errors.
#
# 6. compile and link a client application linking directly to a symlink into 
#    the ".sl" dll built in 1.
#    This should produce no errors.
#
# 7. run the produced executables

# This test can only be run on PE/COFF platforms.
