/*"input_file.c":Operating-system dependant functions to read source files.*/

/*
 * No matter what the operating system, this module must provide the
 * following services to its callers.
 *
 * input_file_begin()			Call once before anything else.
 *
 * input_file_end()			Call once after everything else.
 *
 * input_file_buffer_size()		Call anytime. Returns largest possible
 *					delivery from
 *					input_file_give_next_buffer().
 *
 * input_file_open(name)		Call once for each input file.
 *
 * input_file_give_next_buffer(where)	Call once to get each new buffer.
 *					Return 0: no more chars left in file,
 *					   the file has already been closed.
 *					Otherwise: return a pointer to just
 *					   after the last character we read
 *					   into the buffer.
 *					If we can only read 0 characters, then
 *					end-of-file is faked.
 *
 * input_file_push()			Push state, which can be restored
 *					later.  Does implicit input_file_begin.
 *					Returns char * to saved state.
 *
 * input_file_pop (arg)			Pops previously saved state.
 *
 * input_file_close ()			Closes opened file.
 *
 * All errors are reported so caller doesn't have to think
 * about I/O errors.
