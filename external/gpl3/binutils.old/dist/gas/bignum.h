 *	Arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic.				*
 *	For speed, we work in groups of bits, even though this		*
 *	complicates algorithms.						*
 *	Each group of bits is called a 'littlenum'.			*
 *	A bunch of littlenums representing a (possibly large)		*
 *	integer is called a 'bignum'.					*
 *	Bignums are >= 0.						*
