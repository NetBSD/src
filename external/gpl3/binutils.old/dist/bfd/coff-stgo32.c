/* This file handles now also stubbed coff images. The stub is a small
   DOS executable program before the coff image to load it in memory
   and execute it. This is needed, because DOS cannot run coff files.

   The COFF image is loaded in memory without the stub attached, so
   all offsets are relative to the beginning of the image, not the
   actual file.  We handle this in bfd by setting bfd->origin to where
   the COFF image starts.  */
