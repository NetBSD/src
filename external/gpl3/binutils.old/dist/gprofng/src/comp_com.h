/*
 * This file describes format for the compiler-commentary
 * section to be added to .o's and propagated to the a.out.  It reflects
 * information the compiler can expose to the user about his or her
 * program.  The section should be generated for all compiles where
 * the user has specified -g on the compile line.
 *
 * In the analyzer, display of the messages will be governed by a user UI
 * that sets a vis_bits bitmap, and matches it against a show_bits
 * bitmap table, which is maintained separately from the producer
 * code.  For any message, if (vis_bits&show_bits) is  non-zero, the
 * message is shown.  If zero, the message is not shown.  A similar
 * mechanism would be used for a stand-alone source or disassembly browser.
 *
 *
 * The .compcom Section
 * --------------------
 * The section will be named ".compcom"; it is generated for each
 * .o, and aggregated into a single section in the a.out.  In that
 * section, each .o's data is separate, and the tools will loop
 * over the data for each .o in order to find the subsection for
 * the particular .o being annotated.
 *
 *
 * Since the header is fixed-length, and the total size of the section
 * can be easily determined as:
 *
 *     sizeof(stuct compcomhdr)
 * 	+ msgcount * sizeof(struct compmsg)
 * 	+ paramcount * sizeof(int32_t)
 * 	+ stringlen
 *
 * there is no need to have the size in the header.
