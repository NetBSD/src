   For the VAX we assert that samples will never fall in the first two
   bytes of any routine, since that is the entry mask, thus we call
   scale_and_align_entries() to adjust the entry points if the entry
   mask falls in one bin but the code for the routine doesn't start
   until the next bin.  In conjunction with the alignment of routine
   addresses, this should allow us to have only one sample for every
   four bytes of text space and never have any overlap (the two end
   cases, above).  */
