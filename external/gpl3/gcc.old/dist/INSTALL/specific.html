<p>Binutils pre 2.24 does not have support for selecting <samp><span class="option">-mabi</span></samp> and
does not support ILP32.  If it is used to build GCC 4.9 or later, GCC will
not support option <samp><span class="option">-mabi=ilp32</span></samp>.

   <p>To enable a workaround for the Cortex-A53 erratum number 835769 by default
(for all CPUs regardless of -mcpu option given) at configure time use the
<samp><span class="option">--enable-fix-cortex-a53-835769</span></samp> option.  This will enable the fix by
default and can be explicitly disabled during compilation by passing the
<samp><span class="option">-mno-fix-cortex-a53-835769</span></samp> option.  Conversely,
<samp><span class="option">--disable-fix-cortex-a53-835769</span></samp> will disable the workaround by
default.  The workaround is disabled by default if neither of
<samp><span class="option">--enable-fix-cortex-a53-835769</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="option">--disable-fix-cortex-a53-835769</span></samp> is given at configure time.

   <p>To enable a workaround for the Cortex-A53 erratum number 843419 by default
(for all CPUs regardless of -mcpu option given) at configure time use the
<samp><span class="option">--enable-fix-cortex-a53-843419</span></samp> option.  This workaround is applied at
link time.  Enabling the workaround will cause GCC to pass the relevant option
to the linker.  It can be explicitly disabled during compilation by passing the
<samp><span class="option">-mno-fix-cortex-a53-843419</span></samp> option.  Conversely,
<samp><span class="option">--disable-fix-cortex-a53-843419</span></samp> will disable the workaround by default.

This configuration is intended for embedded systems.

   <p><hr /><a name="x_002dx_002dfreebsd"></a>

<h3 class="heading"><a name="TOC13"></a>*-*-freebsd*</h3>

<p>Support for FreeBSD 1 was discontinued in GCC 3.2.  Support for
FreeBSD 2 (and any mutant a.out variants of FreeBSD 3) was
discontinued in GCC 4.0.

   <p>In order to better utilize FreeBSD base system functionality and match
the configuration of the system compiler, GCC 4.5 and above as well as
GCC 4.4 past 2010-06-20 leverage SSP support in libc (which is present
on FreeBSD 7 or later) and the use of <code>__cxa_atexit</code> by default
(on FreeBSD 6 or later).  The use of <code>dl_iterate_phdr</code> inside
<samp><span class="file">libgcc_s.so.1</span></samp> and boehm-gc (on FreeBSD 7 or later) is enabled
by GCC 4.5 and above.

   <p>We support FreeBSD using the ELF file format with DWARF 2 debugging
for all CPU architectures.  You may use <samp><span class="option">-gstabs</span></samp> instead of
<samp><span class="option">-g</span></samp>, if you really want the old debugging format.  There are
no known issues with mixing object files and libraries with different
debugging formats.  Otherwise, this release of GCC should now match
more of the configuration used in the stock FreeBSD configuration of
GCC.  In particular, <samp><span class="option">--enable-threads</span></samp> is now configured by
default.  However, as a general user, do not attempt to replace the
system compiler with this release.  Known to bootstrap and check with
good results on FreeBSD 7.2-STABLE.  In the past, known to bootstrap
and check with good results on FreeBSD 3.0, 3.4, 4.0, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4,
4.5, 4.8, 4.9 and 5-CURRENT.

   <p>The version of binutils installed in <samp><span class="file">/usr/bin</span></samp> probably works
with this release of GCC.  Bootstrapping against the latest GNU
binutils and/or the version found in <samp><span class="file">/usr/ports/devel/binutils</span></samp> has
been known to enable additional features and improve overall testsuite
results.  However, it is currently known that boehm-gc (which itself
is required for java) may not configure properly on FreeBSD prior to
the FreeBSD 7.0 release with GNU binutils after 2.16.1.

   <p><hr /><a name="hppa_002dhp_002dhpux"></a>

<h3 class="heading"><a name="TOC16"></a>hppa*-hp-hpux*</h3>

<p>Support for HP-UX version 9 and older was discontinued in GCC 3.4.

   <p>We require using gas/binutils on all hppa platforms.  Version 2.19 or
later is recommended.

   <p>It may be helpful to configure GCC with the
<a href="./configure.html#with-gnu-as"><samp><span class="option">--with-gnu-as</span></samp></a> and
<samp><span class="option">--with-as=...</span></samp> options to ensure that GCC can find GAS.

   <p>The HP assembler should not be used with GCC.  It is rarely tested and may
not work.  It shouldn't be used with any languages other than C due to its
many limitations.

   <p>Specifically, <samp><span class="option">-g</span></samp> does not work (HP-UX uses a peculiar debugging
format which GCC does not know about).  It also inserts timestamps
into each object file it creates, causing the 3-stage comparison test to
fail during a bootstrap.  You should be able to continue by saying
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make all-host all-target</span></samp>&rsquo; after getting the failure from &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Various GCC features are not supported.  For example, it does not support weak
symbols or alias definitions.  As a result, explicit template instantiations
are required when using C++.  This makes it difficult if not impossible to
build many C++ applications.

   <p>There are two default scheduling models for instructions.  These are
PROCESSOR_7100LC and PROCESSOR_8000.  They are selected from the pa-risc
architecture specified for the target machine when configuring. 
PROCESSOR_8000 is the default.  PROCESSOR_7100LC is selected when
the target is a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hppa1*</span></samp>&rsquo; machine.

   <p>The PROCESSOR_8000 model is not well suited to older processors.  Thus,
it is important to completely specify the machine architecture when
configuring if you want a model other than PROCESSOR_8000.  The macro
TARGET_SCHED_DEFAULT can be defined in BOOT_CFLAGS if a different
default scheduling model is desired.

   <p>As of GCC 4.0, GCC uses the UNIX 95 namespace for HP-UX 10.10
through 11.00, and the UNIX 98 namespace for HP-UX 11.11 and later. 
This namespace change might cause problems when bootstrapping with
an earlier version of GCC or the HP compiler as essentially the same
namespace is required for an entire build.  This problem can be avoided
in a number of ways.  With HP cc, <samp><span class="env">UNIX_STD</span></samp> can be set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">95</span></samp>&rsquo;
or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">98</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Another way is to add an appropriate set of predefines
to <samp><span class="env">CC</span></samp>.  The description for the <samp><span class="option">munix=</span></samp> option contains
a list of the predefines used with each standard.

   <p>More specific information to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hppa*-hp-hpux*</span></samp>&rsquo; targets follows.

<p>For hpux10.20, we <em>highly</em> recommend you pick up the latest sed patch
<code>PHCO_19798</code> from HP.

   <p>The C++ ABI has changed incompatibly in GCC 4.0.  COMDAT subspaces are
used for one-only code and data.  This resolves many of the previous
problems in using C++ on this target.  However, the ABI is not compatible
with the one implemented under HP-UX 11 using secondary definitions.

   <p><hr /><a name="hppa_002dhp_002dhpux11"></a>

<h3 class="heading"><a name="TOC18"></a>hppa*-hp-hpux11</h3>

<p>GCC 3.0 and up support HP-UX 11.  GCC 2.95.x is not supported and cannot
be used to compile GCC 3.0 and up.

   <p>The libffi and libjava libraries haven't been ported to 64-bit HP-UX and don't build.

   <p>Refer to <a href="binaries.html">binaries</a> for information about obtaining
precompiled GCC binaries for HP-UX.  Precompiled binaries must be obtained
to build the Ada language as it can't be bootstrapped using C.  Ada is
only available for the 32-bit PA-RISC runtime.

   <p>Starting with GCC 3.4 an ISO C compiler is required to bootstrap.  The
bundled compiler supports only traditional C; you will need either HP's
unbundled compiler, or a binary distribution of GCC.

   <p>It is possible to build GCC 3.3 starting with the bundled HP compiler,
but the process requires several steps.  GCC 3.3 can then be used to
build later versions.  The fastjar program contains ISO C code and
can't be built with the HP bundled compiler.  This problem can be
avoided by not building the Java language.  For example, use the
<samp><span class="option">--enable-languages="c,c++,f77,objc"</span></samp> option in your configure
command.

   <p>There are several possible approaches to building the distribution. 
Binutils can be built first using the HP tools.  Then, the GCC
distribution can be built.  The second approach is to build GCC
first using the HP tools, then build binutils, then rebuild GCC. 
There have been problems with various binary distributions, so it
is best not to start from a binary distribution.

   <p>On 64-bit capable systems, there are two distinct targets.  Different
installation prefixes must be used if both are to be installed on
the same system.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hppa[1-2]*-hp-hpux11*</span></samp>&rsquo; target generates code
for the 32-bit PA-RISC runtime architecture and uses the HP linker. 
The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hppa64-hp-hpux11*</span></samp>&rsquo; target generates 64-bit code for the
PA-RISC 2.0 architecture.

   <p>The script config.guess now selects the target type based on the compiler
detected during configuration.  You must define <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp> or <samp><span class="env">CC</span></samp> so
that configure finds an appropriate compiler for the initial bootstrap. 
When <samp><span class="env">CC</span></samp> is used, the definition should contain the options that are
needed whenever <samp><span class="env">CC</span></samp> is used.

   <p>Specifically, options that determine the runtime architecture must be
in <samp><span class="env">CC</span></samp> to correctly select the target for the build.  It is also
convenient to place many other compiler options in <samp><span class="env">CC</span></samp>.  For example,
<samp><span class="env">CC="cc -Ac +DA2.0W -Wp,-H16376 -D_CLASSIC_TYPES -D_HPUX_SOURCE"</span></samp>
can be used to bootstrap the GCC 3.3 branch with the HP compiler in
64-bit K&amp;R/bundled mode.  The <samp><span class="option">+DA2.0W</span></samp> option will result in
the automatic selection of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hppa64-hp-hpux11*</span></samp>&rsquo; target.  The
macro definition table of cpp needs to be increased for a successful
build with the HP compiler.  _CLASSIC_TYPES and _HPUX_SOURCE need to
be defined when building with the bundled compiler, or when using the
<samp><span class="option">-Ac</span></samp> option.  These defines aren't necessary with <samp><span class="option">-Ae</span></samp>.

   <p>It is best to explicitly configure the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hppa64-hp-hpux11*</span></samp>&rsquo; target
with the <samp><span class="option">--with-ld=...</span></samp> option.  This overrides the standard
search for ld.  The two linkers supported on this target require different
commands.  The default linker is determined during configuration.  As a
result, it's not possible to switch linkers in the middle of a GCC build. 
This has been reported to sometimes occur in unified builds of binutils
and GCC.

   <p>A recent linker patch must be installed for the correct operation of
GCC 3.3 and later.  <code>PHSS_26559</code> and <code>PHSS_24304</code> are the
oldest linker patches that are known to work.  They are for HP-UX
11.00 and 11.11, respectively.  <code>PHSS_24303</code>, the companion to
<code>PHSS_24304</code>, might be usable but it hasn't been tested.  These
patches have been superseded.  Consult the HP patch database to obtain
the currently recommended linker patch for your system.

   <p>The patches are necessary for the support of weak symbols on the
32-bit port, and for the running of initializers and finalizers.  Weak
symbols are implemented using SOM secondary definition symbols.  Prior
to HP-UX 11, there are bugs in the linker support for secondary symbols. 
The patches correct a problem of linker core dumps creating shared
libraries containing secondary symbols, as well as various other
linking issues involving secondary symbols.

   <p>GCC 3.3 uses the ELF DT_INIT_ARRAY and DT_FINI_ARRAY capabilities to
run initializers and finalizers on the 64-bit port.  The 32-bit port
uses the linker <samp><span class="option">+init</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">+fini</span></samp> options for the same
purpose.  The patches correct various problems with the +init/+fini
options, including program core dumps.  Binutils 2.14 corrects a
problem on the 64-bit port resulting from HP's non-standard use of
the .init and .fini sections for array initializers and finalizers.

   <p>Although the HP and GNU linkers are both supported for the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hppa64-hp-hpux11*</span></samp>&rsquo; target, it is strongly recommended that the
HP linker be used for link editing on this target.

   <p>At this time, the GNU linker does not support the creation of long
branch stubs.  As a result, it can't successfully link binaries
containing branch offsets larger than 8 megabytes.  In addition,
there are problems linking shared libraries, linking executables
with <samp><span class="option">-static</span></samp>, and with dwarf2 unwind and exception support. 
It also doesn't provide stubs for internal calls to global functions
in shared libraries, so these calls can't be overloaded.

   <p>The HP dynamic loader does not support GNU symbol versioning, so symbol
versioning is not supported.  It may be necessary to disable symbol
versioning with <samp><span class="option">--disable-symvers</span></samp> when using GNU ld.

   <p>POSIX threads are the default.  The optional DCE thread library is not
supported, so <samp><span class="option">--enable-threads=dce</span></samp> does not work.

<!-- FIXME: as patch requirements? -->

   <p>For linking, the Solaris linker, is preferred.  If you want to use the GNU

<p>Support for AIX version 3 and older was discontinued in GCC 3.4.

   <p>&ldquo;out of memory&rdquo; bootstrap failures may indicate a problem with
process resource limits (ulimit).  Hard limits are configured in the
<samp><span class="file">/etc/security/limits</span></samp> system configuration file.

   <p>GCC 4.9 and above require a C++ compiler for bootstrap.  IBM VAC++ / xlC
cannot bootstrap GCC.  xlc can bootstrap an older version of GCC and
G++ can bootstrap recent releases of GCC.

   <p>GCC can bootstrap with recent versions of IBM XLC, but bootstrapping
with an earlier release of GCC is recommended.  Bootstrapping with XLC
requires a larger data segment, which can be enabled through the
<var>LDR_CNTRL</var> environment variable, e.g.,

<pre class="smallexample">     % LDR_CNTRL=MAXDATA=0x50000000
     % export LDR_CNTRL
</pre>
   <p>One can start with a pre-compiled version of GCC to build from
sources.  One may delete GCC's &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; header files when starting
with a version of GCC built for an earlier release of AIX.

   <p>To speed up the configuration phases of bootstrapping and installing GCC,
one may use GNU Bash instead of AIX <samp><span class="command">/bin/sh</span></samp>, e.g.,

<pre class="smallexample">     % CONFIG_SHELL=/opt/freeware/bin/bash
     % export CONFIG_SHELL
</pre>
   <p>and then proceed as described in <a href="build.html">the build instructions</a>, where we strongly recommend specifying an absolute path
to invoke <var>srcdir</var>/configure.

   <p>Because GCC on AIX is built as a 32-bit executable by default,
(although it can generate 64-bit programs) the GMP and MPFR libraries
required by gfortran must be 32-bit libraries.  Building GMP and MPFR
as static archive libraries works better than shared libraries.

   <p>Errors involving <code>alloca</code> when building GCC generally are due
to an incorrect definition of <code>CC</code> in the Makefile or mixing files
compiled with the native C compiler and GCC.  During the stage1 phase of
the build, the native AIX compiler <strong>must</strong> be invoked as <samp><span class="command">cc</span></samp>
(not <samp><span class="command">xlc</span></samp>).  Once <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> has been informed of
<samp><span class="command">xlc</span></samp>, one needs to use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make distclean</span></samp>&rsquo; to remove the
configure cache files and ensure that <samp><span class="env">CC</span></samp> environment variable
does not provide a definition that will confuse <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>. 
If this error occurs during stage2 or later, then the problem most likely
is the version of Make (see above).

   <p>The native <samp><span class="command">as</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp> are recommended for
bootstrapping on AIX.  The GNU Assembler, GNU Linker, and GNU
Binutils version 2.20 is the minimum level that supports bootstrap on
AIX 5.  The GNU Assembler has not been updated to support AIX 6 or
AIX 7.  The native AIX tools do interoperate with GCC.

   <p>AIX 7.1 added partial support for DWARF debugging, but full support
requires AIX 7.1 TL03 SP7 that supports additional DWARF sections and
fixes a bug in the assembler.  AIX 7.1 TL03 SP5 distributed a version
of libm.a missing important symbols; a fix for IV77796 will be
included in SP6.

   <p>AIX 5.3 TL10, AIX 6.1 TL05 and AIX 7.1 TL00 introduced an AIX
assembler change that sometimes produces corrupt assembly files
causing AIX linker errors.  The bug breaks GCC bootstrap on AIX and
can cause compilation failures with existing GCC installations.  An
AIX iFix for AIX 5.3 is available (APAR IZ98385 for AIX 5.3 TL10, APAR
IZ98477 for AIX 5.3 TL11 and IZ98134 for AIX 5.3 TL12). AIX 5.3 TL11 SP8,
AIX 5.3 TL12 SP5, AIX 6.1 TL04 SP11, AIX 6.1 TL05 SP7, AIX 6.1 TL06 SP6,
AIX 6.1 TL07 and AIX 7.1 TL01 should include the fix.

   <p>Building <samp><span class="file">libstdc++.a</span></samp> requires a fix for an AIX Assembler bug
APAR IY26685 (AIX 4.3) or APAR IY25528 (AIX 5.1).  It also requires a

   <p><a name="TransferAixShobj"></a>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">libstdc++</span></samp>&rsquo; in GCC 3.4 increments the major version number of the

3.3 version of the shared library.  Applications either need to be
re-linked against the new shared library or the GCC 3.1 and GCC 3.3
versions of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">libstdc++</span></samp>&rsquo; shared object needs to be available
to the AIX runtime loader.  The GCC 3.1 &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">libstdc++.so.4</span></samp>&rsquo;, if
present, and GCC 3.3 &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">libstdc++.so.5</span></samp>&rsquo; shared objects can be

the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F_LOADONLY</span></samp>&rsquo; flag in the shared object for <em>each</em>
multilib <samp><span class="file">libstdc++.a</span></samp> installed:

   <p>Extract the shared objects from the currently installed
<samp><span class="file">libstdc++.a</span></samp> archive:
<pre class="smallexample">     % ar -x libstdc++.a libstdc++.so.4 libstdc++.so.5
</pre>
   <p>Enable the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F_LOADONLY</span></samp>&rsquo; flag so that the shared object will be
available for runtime dynamic loading, but not linking:
<pre class="smallexample">     % strip -e libstdc++.so.4 libstdc++.so.5
</pre>
   <p>Archive the runtime-only shared object in the GCC 3.4
<samp><span class="file">libstdc++.a</span></samp> archive:
<pre class="smallexample">     % ar -q libstdc++.a libstdc++.so.4 libstdc++.so.5
</pre>
   <p>Eventually, the
<a href="./configure.html#WithAixSoname"><samp><span class="option">--with-aix-soname=svr4</span></samp></a>
configure option may drop the need for this procedure for libraries that
support it.

   <p>Linking executables and shared libraries may produce warnings of
duplicate symbols.  The assembly files generated by GCC for AIX always
have included multiple symbol definitions for certain global variable
and function declarations in the original program.  The warnings should
not prevent the linker from producing a correct library or runnable
executable.

   <p>AIX 4.3 utilizes a &ldquo;large format&rdquo; archive to support both 32-bit and
64-bit object modules.  The routines provided in AIX 4.3.0 and AIX 4.3.1
to parse archive libraries did not handle the new format correctly. 
These routines are used by GCC and result in error messages during
linking such as &ldquo;not a COFF file&rdquo;.  The version of the routines shipped
with AIX 4.3.1 should work for a 32-bit environment.  The <samp><span class="option">-g</span></samp>
option of the archive command may be used to create archives of 32-bit
objects using the original &ldquo;small format&rdquo;.  A correct version of the
routines is shipped with AIX 4.3.2 and above.

   <p>Some versions of the AIX binder (linker) can fail with a relocation
overflow severe error when the <samp><span class="option">-bbigtoc</span></samp> option is used to link

   <p>The AIX 4.3.2.1 linker (bos.rte.bind_cmds Level 4.3.2.1) will dump core

   <p>The initial assembler shipped with AIX 4.3.0 generates incorrect object
files.  A fix for APAR IX74254 (64BIT DISASSEMBLED OUTPUT FROM COMPILER FAILS
TO ASSEMBLE/BIND) is available from IBM Customer Support and from its
<a href="http://techsupport.services.ibm.com/">techsupport.services.ibm.com</a>
website as PTF U453956.  This fix is incorporated in AIX 4.3.1 and above.

   <p>AIX provides National Language Support (NLS).  Compilers and assemblers
use NLS to support locale-specific representations of various data
formats including floating-point numbers (e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;  vs &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">,</span></samp>&rsquo; for
separating decimal fractions).  There have been problems reported where
GCC does not produce the same floating-point formats that the assembler
expects.  If one encounters this problem, set the <samp><span class="env">LANG</span></samp>
environment variable to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">En_US</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>A default can be specified with the <samp><span class="option">-mcpu=</span><var>cpu_type</var></samp>

later systems and others that support the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ll</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sc</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sync</span></samp>&rsquo; instructions.  This can be overridden by passing
<samp><span class="option">--with-llsc</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">--without-llsc</span></samp> when configuring GCC. 
Since the Linux kernel emulates these instructions if they are
missing, the default for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mips*-*-linux*</span></samp>&rsquo; targets is
<samp><span class="option">--with-llsc</span></samp>.  The <samp><span class="option">--with-llsc</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">--without-llsc</span></samp> configure options may be overridden at compile
time by passing the <samp><span class="option">-mllsc</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-mno-llsc</span></samp> options to
the compiler.

   <p>MIPS systems check for division by zero (unless
<samp><span class="option">-mno-check-zero-division</span></samp> is passed to the compiler) by
generating either a conditional trap or a break instruction.  Using
trap results in smaller code, but is only supported on MIPS II and
later.  Also, some versions of the Linux kernel have a bug that
prevents trap from generating the proper signal (<code>SIGFPE</code>).  To enable
the use of break, use the <samp><span class="option">--with-divide=breaks</span></samp>
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> option when configuring GCC.  The default is to
use traps on systems that support them.

   <p>The assembler from GNU binutils 2.17 and earlier has a bug in the way
it sorts relocations for REL targets (o32, o64, EABI).  This can cause
bad code to be generated for simple C++ programs.  Also the linker
from GNU binutils versions prior to 2.17 has a bug which causes the
runtime linker stubs in very large programs, like <samp><span class="file">libgcj.so</span></samp>, to
be incorrectly generated.  GNU Binutils 2.18 and later (and snapshots
made after Nov. 9, 2006) should be free from both of these problems.

<p>Support for Solaris 9 has been removed in GCC 5.  Support for Solaris
8 has been removed in GCC 4.8.  Support for Solaris 7 has been removed
in GCC 4.6.

   <p>Sun does not ship a C compiler with Solaris 2 before Solaris 10, though
you can download the Sun Studio compilers for free.  In Solaris 10 and
11, GCC 3.4.3 is available as <samp><span class="command">/usr/sfw/bin/gcc</span></samp>.  Solaris 11
also provides GCC 4.5.2, 4.7.3, and 4.8.2 as
<samp><span class="command">/usr/gcc/4.5/bin/gcc</span></samp> or similar.  Alternatively,
you can install a pre-built GCC to bootstrap and install GCC.  See the
<a href="binaries.html">binaries page</a> for details.

   <p>The Solaris 2 <samp><span class="command">/bin/sh</span></samp> will often fail to configure
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">libstdc++-v3</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">boehm-gc</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">libjava</span></samp>&rsquo;.  We therefore
recommend using the following initial sequence of commands

<pre class="smallexample">     % CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/ksh
     % export CONFIG_SHELL
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and proceed as described in <a href="configure.html">the configure instructions</a>. 
In addition we strongly recommend specifying an absolute path to invoke
<samp><var>srcdir</var><span class="command">/configure</span></samp>.

   <p>Solaris 10 comes with a number of optional OS packages.  Some of these
are needed to use GCC fully, namely <code>SUNWarc</code>,
<code>SUNWbtool</code>, <code>SUNWesu</code>, <code>SUNWhea</code>, <code>SUNWlibm</code>,
<code>SUNWsprot</code>, and <code>SUNWtoo</code>.  If you did not install all
optional packages when installing Solaris 10, you will need to verify that
the packages that GCC needs are installed. 
To check whether an optional package is installed, use
the <samp><span class="command">pkginfo</span></samp> command.  To add an optional package, use the
<samp><span class="command">pkgadd</span></samp> command.  For further details, see the Solaris 10
documentation.

   <p>Starting with Solaris 11, the package management has changed, so you
need to check for <code>system/header</code>, <code>system/linker</code>, and
<code>developer/assembler</code> packages.  Checking for and installing
packages is done with the <samp><span class="command">pkg</span></samp> command now.

   <p>Trying to use the linker and other tools in
<samp><span class="file">/usr/ucb</span></samp> to install GCC has been observed to cause trouble. 
For example, the linker may hang indefinitely.  The fix is to remove
<samp><span class="file">/usr/ucb</span></samp> from your <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp>.

   <p>The build process works more smoothly with the legacy Sun tools so, if you
have <samp><span class="file">/usr/xpg4/bin</span></samp> in your <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp>, we recommend that you place
<samp><span class="file">/usr/bin</span></samp> before <samp><span class="file">/usr/xpg4/bin</span></samp> for the duration of the build.

   <p>We recommend the use of the Solaris assembler or the GNU assembler, in
conjunction with the Solaris linker.  The GNU <samp><span class="command">as</span></samp>
versions included in Solaris 10, from GNU binutils 2.15 (in
<samp><span class="file">/usr/sfw/bin/gas</span></samp>), and Solaris 11,
from GNU binutils 2.19 or newer (also in <samp><span class="file">/usr/bin/gas</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">/usr/gnu/bin/as</span></samp>), are known to work. 
Current versions of GNU binutils (2.26)
are known to work as well, with the caveat mentioned in
<a href="#ix86-x-solaris210">i?86-*-solaris2.10</a> .  Note that your mileage may vary
if you use a combination of the GNU tools and the Solaris tools: while the
combination GNU <samp><span class="command">as</span></samp> + Sun <samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp> should reasonably work,
the reverse combination Sun <samp><span class="command">as</span></samp> + GNU <samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp> may fail to
build or cause memory corruption at runtime in some cases for C++ programs. 
<!-- FIXME: still? -->
GNU <samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp> usually works as well, although the version included in
Solaris 10 cannot be used due to several bugs.  Again, the current
version (2.26) is known to work, but generally lacks platform specific
features, so better stay with Solaris <samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp>.  To use the LTO linker
plugin (<samp><span class="option">-fuse-linker-plugin</span></samp>) with GNU <samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp>, GNU
binutils <em>must</em> be configured with <samp><span class="option">--enable-largefile</span></samp>.

   <p>To enable symbol versioning in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">libstdc++</span></samp>&rsquo; with the Solaris linker,
you need to have any version of GNU <samp><span class="command">c++filt</span></samp>, which is part of
GNU binutils.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">libstdc++</span></samp>&rsquo; symbol versioning will be disabled if no
appropriate version is found.  Solaris <samp><span class="command">c++filt</span></samp> from the Solaris
Studio compilers does <em>not</em> work.

   <p>GNU <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> version 3.81 or later is required to build libjava
with the Solaris linker.

   <p>Sun bug 4927647 sometimes causes random spurious testsuite failures
related to missing diagnostic output.  This bug doesn't affect GCC
itself, rather it is a kernel bug triggered by the <samp><span class="command">expect</span></samp>
program which is used only by the GCC testsuite driver.  When the bug
causes the <samp><span class="command">expect</span></samp> program to miss anticipated output, extra
testsuite failures appear.

   <p>Newer versions of the GNU Multiple Precision Library (GMP), the MPFR

<p>When GCC is configured to use GNU binutils 2.14 or later, the binaries
produced are smaller than the ones produced using Sun's native tools;
this difference is quite significant for binaries containing debugging
information.

   <p>Starting with Solaris 7, the operating system is capable of executing
64-bit SPARC V9 binaries.  GCC 3.1 and later properly supports
this; the <samp><span class="option">-m64</span></samp> option enables 64-bit code generation. 
However, if all you want is code tuned for the UltraSPARC CPU, you
should try the <samp><span class="option">-mtune=ultrasparc</span></samp> option instead, which produces
code that, unlike full 64-bit code, can still run on non-UltraSPARC
machines.

   <p>When configuring the GNU Multiple Precision Library (GMP), the MPFR
library or the MPC library on a Solaris 7 or later system, the canonical
target triplet must be specified as the <samp><span class="command">build</span></samp> parameter on the
configure line.  This target triplet can be obtained by invoking <samp><span class="command">./config.guess</span></samp> in the toplevel source directory of GCC (and
not that of GMP or MPFR or MPC).  For example on a Solaris 9 system:

<pre class="smallexample">     % ./configure --build=sparc-sun-solaris2.9 --prefix=xxx
</pre>

<p>Support for VxWorks is in flux.  At present GCC supports <em>only</em> the
very recent VxWorks 5.5 (aka Tornado 2.2) release, and only on PowerPC. 
We welcome patches for other architectures supported by VxWorks 5.5. 
Support for VxWorks AE would also be welcome; we believe this is merely
a matter of writing an appropriate &ldquo;configlette&rdquo; (see below).  We are
not interested in supporting older, a.out or COFF-based, versions of
VxWorks in GCC 3.

   <p>VxWorks comes with an older version of GCC installed in
<samp><var>$WIND_BASE</var><span class="file">/host</span></samp>; we recommend you do not overwrite it. 
Choose an installation <var>prefix</var> entirely outside <var>$WIND_BASE</var>. 
Before running <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>, create the directories <samp><var>prefix</var></samp>
and <samp><var>prefix</var><span class="file">/bin</span></samp>.  Link or copy the appropriate assembler,
linker, etc. into <samp><var>prefix</var><span class="file">/bin</span></samp>, and set your <var>PATH</var> to
include that directory while running both <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>.

   <p>You must give <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> the
<samp><span class="option">--with-headers=</span><var>$WIND_BASE</var><span class="option">/target/h</span></samp> switch so that it can
find the VxWorks system headers.  Since VxWorks is a cross compilation
target only, you must also specify <samp><span class="option">--target=</span><var>target</var></samp>. 
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> will attempt to create the directory
<samp><var>prefix</var><span class="file">/</span><var>target</var><span class="file">/sys-include</span></samp> and copy files into it;
make sure the user running <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> has sufficient privilege
to do so.

   <p>GCC's exception handling runtime requires a special &ldquo;configlette&rdquo;
module, <samp><span class="file">contrib/gthr_supp_vxw_5x.c</span></samp>.  Follow the instructions in
that file to add the module to your kernel build.  (Future versions of

<samp><span class="option">-fpic</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-fPIC</span></samp> options are used.  In other
respects, this target is the same as the

<h3 class="heading"><a name="TOC74"></a>Microsoft Windows</h3>

<h4 class="subheading"><a name="TOC75"></a>Intel 16-bit versions</h4>

<p>The 16-bit versions of Microsoft Windows, such as Windows 3.1, are not
supported.

   <p>However, the 32-bit port has limited support for Microsoft
Windows 3.11 in the Win32s environment, as a target only.  See below.

<h4 class="subheading"><a name="TOC76"></a>Intel 32-bit versions</h4>

<p>The 32-bit versions of Windows, including Windows 95, Windows NT, Windows
XP, and Windows Vista, are supported by several different target
platforms.  These targets differ in which Windows subsystem they target
and which C libraries are used.

     <ul>
<li>Cygwin <a href="#x-x-cygwin">*-*-cygwin</a>: Cygwin provides a user-space
Linux API emulation layer in the Win32 subsystem. 
<li>Interix <a href="#x-x-interix">*-*-interix</a>: The Interix subsystem
provides native support for POSIX. 
<li>MinGW <a href="#x-x-mingw32">*-*-mingw32</a>: MinGW is a native GCC port for
the Win32 subsystem that provides a subset of POSIX. 
<li>MKS i386-pc-mks: NuTCracker from MKS.  See
<a href="http://www.mkssoftware.com/">http://www.mkssoftware.com/</a> for more information. 
</ul>

<h4 class="subheading"><a name="TOC77"></a>Intel 64-bit versions</h4>

<p>GCC contains support for x86-64 using the mingw-w64
runtime library, available from <a href="http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/">http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/</a>. 
This library should be used with the target triple x86_64-pc-mingw32.

   <p>Presently Windows for Itanium is not supported.

<h4 class="subheading"><a name="TOC78"></a>Windows CE</h4>

<p>Windows CE is supported as a target only on Hitachi
SuperH (sh-wince-pe), and MIPS (mips-wince-pe).

<h4 class="subheading"><a name="TOC79"></a>Other Windows Platforms</h4>

<p>GCC no longer supports Windows NT on the Alpha or PowerPC.

   <p>GCC no longer supports the Windows POSIX subsystem.  However, it does
support the Interix subsystem.  See above.

   <p>Old target names including *-*-winnt and *-*-windowsnt are no longer used.

   <p>PW32 (i386-pc-pw32) support was never completed, and the project seems to
be inactive.  See <a href="http://pw32.sourceforge.net/">http://pw32.sourceforge.net/</a> for more information.

   <p>UWIN support has been removed due to a lack of maintenance.

   <p><hr /><a name="x_002dx_002dcygwin"></a>

<h3 class="heading"><a name="TOC80"></a>*-*-cygwin</h3>

<p>Ports of GCC are included with the
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin environment</a>.

   <p>GCC will build under Cygwin without modification; it does not build
with Microsoft's C++ compiler and there are no plans to make it do so.

   <p>The Cygwin native compiler can be configured to target any 32-bit x86
cpu architecture desired; the default is i686-pc-cygwin.  It should be
used with as up-to-date a version of binutils as possible; use either
the latest official GNU binutils release in the Cygwin distribution,
or version 2.20 or above if building your own.

   <p><hr /><a name="x_002dx_002dinterix"></a>

<h3 class="heading"><a name="TOC81"></a>*-*-interix</h3>

<p>The Interix target is used by OpenNT, Interix, Services For UNIX (SFU),
and Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications (SUA).  Applications compiled
with this target run in the Interix subsystem, which is separate from
the Win32 subsystem.  This target was last known to work in GCC 3.3.

   <p><hr /><a name="x_002dx_002dmingw32"></a>

<h3 class="heading"><a name="TOC82"></a>*-*-mingw32</h3>

<p>GCC will build with and support only MinGW runtime 3.12 and later. 
Earlier versions of headers are incompatible with the new default semantics
of <code>extern inline</code> in <code>-std=c99</code> and <code>-std=gnu99</code> modes.

   <p><hr /><a name="older"></a>

<h3 class="heading"><a name="TOC83"></a>Older systems</h3>

<p>GCC contains support files for many older (1980s and early
1990s) Unix variants.  For the most part, support for these systems
has not been deliberately removed, but it has not been maintained for
several years and may suffer from bitrot.

   <p>Starting with GCC 3.1, each release has a list of &ldquo;obsoleted&rdquo; systems. 
Support for these systems is still present in that release, but
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> will fail unless the <samp><span class="option">--enable-obsolete</span></samp>
option is given.  Unless a maintainer steps forward, support for these
systems will be removed from the next release of GCC.

   <p>Support for old systems as hosts for GCC can cause problems if the
workarounds for compiler, library and operating system bugs affect the
cleanliness or maintainability of the rest of GCC.  In some cases, to
bring GCC up on such a system, if still possible with current GCC, may
require first installing an old version of GCC which did work on that
system, and using it to compile a more recent GCC, to avoid bugs in the
vendor compiler.  Old releases of GCC 1 and GCC 2 are available in the
<samp><span class="file">old-releases</span></samp> directory on the <a href="../mirrors.html">GCC mirror sites</a>.  Header bugs may generally be avoided using
<samp><span class="command">fixincludes</span></samp>, but bugs or deficiencies in libraries and the
operating system may still cause problems.

   <p>Support for older systems as targets for cross-compilation is less
problematic than support for them as hosts for GCC; if an enthusiast
wishes to make such a target work again (including resurrecting any of
the targets that never worked with GCC 2, starting from the last
version before they were removed), patches
<a href="../contribute.html">following the usual requirements</a> would be
likely to be accepted, since they should not affect the support for more
modern targets.

   <p>For some systems, old versions of GNU binutils may also be useful,
and are available from <samp><span class="file">pub/binutils/old-releases</span></samp> on
<a href="http://sourceware.org/mirrors.html">sourceware.org mirror sites</a>.

   <p>Some of the information on specific systems above relates to
such older systems, but much of the information
about GCC on such systems (which may no longer be applicable to
current GCC) is to be found in the GCC texinfo manual.

   <p><hr /><a name="elf"></a>

<h3 class="heading"><a name="TOC84"></a>all ELF targets (SVR4, Solaris 2, etc.)</h3>

<p>C++ support is significantly better on ELF targets if you use the
<a href="./configure.html#with-gnu-ld">GNU linker</a>; duplicate copies of
inlines, vtables and template instantiations will be discarded
automatically.
