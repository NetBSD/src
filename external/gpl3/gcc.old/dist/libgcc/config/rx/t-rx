# Add functions required by the RX ABI which are not part of
# the normal libgcc sources:

LIB2ADD = $(srcdir)/config/rx/rx-abi-functions.c


# We need special handling of the floating point conversion
# routines, to allow for the varying size of a double:

FPBIT = fp-bit.c
$(gcc_objdir)/fp-bit.c: $(gcc_srcdir)/config/fp-bit.c
	echo '#define FLOAT'		     > $@
	echo '#ifndef __RX_64BIT_DOUBLES__' >> $@
	echo '#define DF SF'		    >> $@
	echo '#define FLOAT_ONLY'	    >> $@
	echo '#endif' 			    >> $@
	cat $(gcc_srcdir)/config/fp-bit.c   >> $@

DPBIT = dp-bit.c
$(gcc_objdir)/dp-bit.c: $(gcc_srcdir)/config/fp-bit.c
	echo '#ifdef __RX_64BIT_DOUBLES__'   > $@
	cat $(gcc_srcdir)/config/fp-bit.c   >> $@
