/* Update PHI nodes for a guard of the LOOP.

   Input:
   - LOOP, GUARD_EDGE: LOOP is a loop for which we added guard code that
        controls whether LOOP is to be executed.  GUARD_EDGE is the edge that
        originates from the guard-bb, skips LOOP and reaches the (unique) exit
        bb of LOOP.  This loop-exit-bb is an empty bb with one successor.
        We denote this bb NEW_MERGE_BB because before the guard code was added
        it had a single predecessor (the LOOP header), and now it became a merge
        point of two paths - the path that ends with the LOOP exit-edge, and
        the path that ends with GUARD_EDGE.
   - NEW_EXIT_BB: New basic block that is added by this function between LOOP
        and NEW_MERGE_BB. It is used to place loop-closed-ssa-form exit-phis.

   ===> The CFG before the guard-code was added:
        LOOP_header_bb:
          loop_body
          if (exit_loop) goto update_bb
          else           goto LOOP_header_bb
        update_bb:

   ==> The CFG after the guard-code was added:
        guard_bb:
          if (LOOP_guard_condition) goto new_merge_bb
          else                      goto LOOP_header_bb
        LOOP_header_bb:
          loop_body
          if (exit_loop_condition) goto new_merge_bb
          else                     goto LOOP_header_bb
        new_merge_bb:
          goto update_bb
        update_bb:

   ==> The CFG after this function:
        guard_bb:
          if (LOOP_guard_condition) goto new_merge_bb
          else                      goto LOOP_header_bb
        LOOP_header_bb:
          loop_body
          if (exit_loop_condition) goto new_exit_bb
          else                     goto LOOP_header_bb
        new_exit_bb:
        new_merge_bb:
          goto update_bb
        update_bb:

   This function:
   1. creates and updates the relevant phi nodes to account for the new
      incoming edge (GUARD_EDGE) into NEW_MERGE_BB. This involves:
      1.1. Create phi nodes at NEW_MERGE_BB.
      1.2. Update the phi nodes at the successor of NEW_MERGE_BB (denoted
           UPDATE_BB).  UPDATE_BB was the exit-bb of LOOP before NEW_MERGE_BB
   2. preserves loop-closed-ssa-form by creating the required phi nodes
      at the exit of LOOP (i.e, in NEW_EXIT_BB).

   There are two flavors to this function:

   slpeel_update_phi_nodes_for_guard1:
     Here the guard controls whether we enter or skip LOOP, where LOOP is a
     prolog_loop (loop1 below), and the new phis created in NEW_MERGE_BB are
     for variables that have phis in the loop header.

   slpeel_update_phi_nodes_for_guard2:
     Here the guard controls whether we enter or skip LOOP, where LOOP is an
     epilog_loop (loop2 below), and the new phis created in NEW_MERGE_BB are
     for variables that have phis in the loop exit.

   I.E., the overall structure is:

        loop1_preheader_bb:
                guard1 (goto loop1/merge1_bb)
        loop1
        loop1_exit_bb:
                guard2 (goto merge1_bb/merge2_bb)
        merge1_bb
        loop2
        loop2_exit_bb
        merge2_bb
        next_bb

   slpeel_update_phi_nodes_for_guard1 takes care of creating phis in
   loop1_exit_bb and merge1_bb. These are entry phis (phis for the vars
   that have phis in loop1->header).

   slpeel_update_phi_nodes_for_guard2 takes care of creating phis in
   loop2_exit_bb and merge2_bb. These are exit phis (phis for the vars
   that have phis in next_bb). It also adds some of these phis to
   loop1_exit_bb.

   slpeel_update_phi_nodes_for_guard1 is always called before
   slpeel_update_phi_nodes_for_guard2. They are both needed in order
   to create correct data-flow and loop-closed-ssa-form.

   Generally slpeel_update_phi_nodes_for_guard1 creates phis for variables
   that change between iterations of a loop (and therefore have a phi-node
   at the loop entry), whereas slpeel_update_phi_nodes_for_guard2 creates
   phis for variables that are used out of the loop (and therefore have
   loop-closed exit phis). Some variables may be both updated between
   iterations and used after the loop. This is why in loop1_exit_bb we
   may need both entry_phis (created by slpeel_update_phi_nodes_for_guard1)
   and exit phis (created by slpeel_update_phi_nodes_for_guard2).

   - IS_NEW_LOOP: if IS_NEW_LOOP is true, then LOOP is a newly created copy of
     an original loop. i.e., we have:

           orig_loop
           guard_bb (goto LOOP/new_merge)
           new_loop <-- LOOP
           new_exit
           new_merge
           next_bb

     If IS_NEW_LOOP is false, then LOOP is an original loop, in which case we
     have:

           new_loop
           guard_bb (goto LOOP/new_merge)
           orig_loop <-- LOOP
           new_exit
           new_merge
           next_bb

     The SSA names defined in the original loop have a current
     reaching definition that records the corresponding new ssa-name
     used in the new duplicated loop copy.
  */

/* Function slpeel_update_phi_nodes_for_guard1

   Input:
   - GUARD_EDGE, LOOP, IS_NEW_LOOP, NEW_EXIT_BB - as explained above.
   - DEFS - a bitmap of ssa names to mark new names for which we recorded
            information.

   In the context of the overall structure, we have:

        loop1_preheader_bb:
                guard1 (goto loop1/merge1_bb)
LOOP->  loop1
        loop1_exit_bb:
                guard2 (goto merge1_bb/merge2_bb)
        merge1_bb
        loop2
        loop2_exit_bb
        merge2_bb
        next_bb

   For each name updated between loop iterations (i.e - for each name that has
   an entry (loop-header) phi in LOOP) we create a new phi in:
   1. merge1_bb (to account for the edge from guard1)
   2. loop1_exit_bb (an exit-phi to keep LOOP in loop-closed form)

/* Function slpeel_tree_peel_loop_to_edge.

   Peel the first (last) iterations of LOOP into a new prolog (epilog) loop
   that is placed on the entry (exit) edge E of LOOP. After this transformation
   we have two loops one after the other - first-loop iterates FIRST_NITERS
   times, and second-loop iterates the remainder NITERS - FIRST_NITERS times.
   If the cost model indicates that it is profitable to emit a scalar
   loop instead of the vector one, then the prolog (epilog) loop will iterate
   for the entire unchanged scalar iterations of the loop.

   Input:
   - LOOP: the loop to be peeled.
   - SCALAR_LOOP: if non-NULL, the alternate loop from which basic blocks
	should be copied.
   - E: the exit or entry edge of LOOP.
        If it is the entry edge, we peel the first iterations of LOOP. In this
        case first-loop is LOOP, and second-loop is the newly created loop.
        If it is the exit edge, we peel the last iterations of LOOP. In this
        case, first-loop is the newly created loop, and second-loop is LOOP.
   - NITERS: the number of iterations that LOOP iterates.
   - FIRST_NITERS: the number of iterations that the first-loop should iterate.
   - UPDATE_FIRST_LOOP_COUNT:  specified whether this function is responsible
        for updating the loop bound of the first-loop to FIRST_NITERS.  If it
        is false, the caller of this function may want to take care of this
        (this can be useful if we don't want new stmts added to first-loop).
   - TH: cost model profitability threshold of iterations for vectorization.
   - CHECK_PROFITABILITY: specify whether cost model check has not occurred
                          during versioning and hence needs to occur during
			  prologue generation or whether cost model check
			  has not occurred during prologue generation and hence
			  needs to occur during epilogue generation.
   - BOUND1 is the upper bound on number of iterations of the first loop (if known)
   - BOUND2 is the upper bound on number of iterations of the second loop (if known)


   Output:
   The function returns a pointer to the new loop-copy, or NULL if it failed
   to perform the transformation.

   The function generates two if-then-else guards: one before the first loop,
   and the other before the second loop:
   The first guard is:
     if (FIRST_NITERS == 0) then skip the first loop,
     and go directly to the second loop.
   The second guard is:
     if (FIRST_NITERS == NITERS) then skip the second loop.

   If the optional COND_EXPR and COND_EXPR_STMT_LIST arguments are given
   then the generated condition is combined with COND_EXPR and the
   statements in COND_EXPR_STMT_LIST are emitted together with it.

   FORNOW only simple loops are supported (see slpeel_can_duplicate_loop_p).
   FORNOW the resulting code will not be in loop-closed-ssa form.

/*   Function vect_update_ivs_after_vectorizer.

     "Advance" the induction variables of LOOP to the value they should take
     after the execution of LOOP.  This is currently necessary because the
     vectorizer does not handle induction variables that are used after the
     loop.  Such a situation occurs when the last iterations of LOOP are
     peeled, because:
     1. We introduced new uses after LOOP for IVs that were not originally used
        after LOOP: the IVs of LOOP are now used by an epilog loop.
     2. LOOP is going to be vectorized; this means that it will iterate N/VF
        times, whereas the loop IVs should be bumped N times.

     Input:
     - LOOP - a loop that is going to be vectorized. The last few iterations
              of LOOP were peeled.
     - NITERS - the number of iterations that LOOP executes (before it is
                vectorized). i.e, the number of times the ivs should be bumped.
     - UPDATE_E - a successor edge of LOOP->exit that is on the (only) path
                  coming out from LOOP on which there are uses of the LOOP ivs
		  (this is the path from LOOP->exit to epilog_loop->preheader).

                  The new definitions of the ivs are placed in LOOP->exit.
                  The phi args associated with the edge UPDATE_E in the bb
                  UPDATE_E->dest are updated accordingly.

     Assumption 1: Like the rest of the vectorizer, this function assumes
     a single loop exit that has a single predecessor.

     Assumption 2: The phi nodes in the LOOP header and in update_bb are
     organized in the same order.

     Assumption 3: The access function of the ivs is simple enough (see
     vect_can_advance_ivs_p).  This assumption will be relaxed in the future.

     Assumption 4: Exactly one of the successors of LOOP exit-bb is on a path
     coming out of LOOP on which the ivs of LOOP are used (this is the path
     that leads to the epilog loop; other paths skip the epilog loop).  This
     path starts with the edge UPDATE_E, and its destination (denoted update_bb)
     needs to have its phis updated.

   Set the number of iterations for the loop represented by LOOP_VINFO
   to the minimum between LOOP_NITERS (the original iteration count of the loop)
   and the misalignment of DR - the data reference recorded in
   LOOP_VINFO_UNALIGNED_DR (LOOP_VINFO).  As a result, after the execution of
   this loop, the data reference DR will refer to an aligned location.

   The following computation is generated:

   If the misalignment of DR is known at compile time:
     addr_mis = int mis = DR_MISALIGNMENT (dr);
   Else, compute address misalignment in bytes:
     addr_mis = addr & (vectype_align - 1)

   prolog_niters = min (LOOP_NITERS, ((VF - addr_mis/elem_size)&(VF-1))/step)

   (elem_size = element type size; an element is the scalar element whose type
   is the inner type of the vectype)

   When the step of the data-ref in the loop is not 1 (as in interleaved data
   and SLP), the number of iterations of the prolog must be divided by the step
   (which is equal to the size of interleaved group).

   The above formulas assume that VF == number of elements in the vector. This
   may not hold when there are multiple-types in the loop.
   In this case, for some data-references in the loop the VF does not represent
   the number of elements that fit in the vector.  Therefore, instead of VF we
   use TYPE_VECTOR_SUBPARTS.  */

   If the loop has data references that may or may not be aligned or/and
   has data reference relations whose independence was not proven then
   two versions of the loop need to be generated, one which is vectorized
   and one which isn't.  A test is then generated to control which of the
   loops is executed.  The test checks for the alignment of all of the
   data references that may or may not be aligned.  An additional
   sequence of runtime tests is generated for each pairs of DDRs whose
   independence was not proven.  The vectorized version of loop is
   executed only if both alias and alignment tests are passed.

   The test generated to check which version of loop is executed
   is modified to also check for profitability as indicated by the
   cost model initially.

   The versioning precondition(s) are placed in *COND_EXPR and
   *COND_EXPR_STMT_LIST.  */
