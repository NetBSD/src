/* Loop Vectorization Pass.

   This pass tries to vectorize loops.

   For example, the vectorizer transforms the following simple loop:

        short a[N]; short b[N]; short c[N]; int i;

        for (i=0; i<N; i++){
          a[i] = b[i] + c[i];
        }

   as if it was manually vectorized by rewriting the source code into:

        typedef int __attribute__((mode(V8HI))) v8hi;
        short a[N];  short b[N]; short c[N];   int i;
        v8hi *pa = (v8hi*)a, *pb = (v8hi*)b, *pc = (v8hi*)c;
        v8hi va, vb, vc;

        for (i=0; i<N/8; i++){
          vb = pb[i];
          vc = pc[i];
          va = vb + vc;
          pa[i] = va;
        }

        The main entry to this pass is vectorize_loops(), in which
   the vectorizer applies a set of analyses on a given set of loops,
   followed by the actual vectorization transformation for the loops that
   had successfully passed the analysis phase.
        Throughout this pass we make a distinction between two types of
   data: scalars (which are represented by SSA_NAMES), and memory references
   ("data-refs"). These two types of data require different handling both
   during analysis and transformation. The types of data-refs that the
   vectorizer currently supports are ARRAY_REFS which base is an array DECL
   (not a pointer), and INDIRECT_REFS through pointers; both array and pointer
   accesses are required to have a simple (consecutive) access pattern.

   Analysis phase:
   ===============
        The driver for the analysis phase is vect_analyze_loop().
   It applies a set of analyses, some of which rely on the scalar evolution
   analyzer (scev) developed by Sebastian Pop.

        During the analysis phase the vectorizer records some information
   per stmt in a "stmt_vec_info" struct which is attached to each stmt in the
   loop, as well as general information about the loop as a whole, which is
   recorded in a "loop_vec_info" struct attached to each loop.

   Transformation phase:
   =====================
        The loop transformation phase scans all the stmts in the loop, and
   creates a vector stmt (or a sequence of stmts) for each scalar stmt S in
   the loop that needs to be vectorized. It inserts the vector code sequence
   just before the scalar stmt S, and records a pointer to the vector code
   in STMT_VINFO_VEC_STMT (stmt_info) (stmt_info is the stmt_vec_info struct
   attached to S). This pointer will be used for the vectorization of following
   stmts which use the def of stmt S. Stmt S is removed if it writes to memory;
   otherwise, we rely on dead code elimination for removing it.

        For example, say stmt S1 was vectorized into stmt VS1:

   VS1: vb = px[i];
   S1:  b = x[i];    STMT_VINFO_VEC_STMT (stmt_info (S1)) = VS1
   S2:  a = b;

   To vectorize stmt S2, the vectorizer first finds the stmt that defines
   the operand 'b' (S1), and gets the relevant vector def 'vb' from the
   vector stmt VS1 pointed to by STMT_VINFO_VEC_STMT (stmt_info (S1)). The
   resulting sequence would be:

   VS1: vb = px[i];
   S1:  b = x[i];       STMT_VINFO_VEC_STMT (stmt_info (S1)) = VS1
   VS2: va = vb;
   S2:  a = b;          STMT_VINFO_VEC_STMT (stmt_info (S2)) = VS2

        Operands that are not SSA_NAMEs, are data-refs that appear in
   load/store operations (like 'x[i]' in S1), and are handled differently.

   Target modeling:
   =================
        Currently the only target specific information that is used is the
   size of the vector (in bytes) - "UNITS_PER_SIMD_WORD". Targets that can
   support different sizes of vectors, for now will need to specify one value
   for "UNITS_PER_SIMD_WORD". More flexibility will be added in the future.

        Since we only vectorize operations which vector form can be
   expressed using existing tree codes, to verify that an operation is
   supported, the vectorizer checks the relevant optab at the relevant
   machine_mode (e.g, optab_handler (add_optab, V8HImode)->insn_code). If
   the value found is CODE_FOR_nothing, then there's no target support, and
   we can't vectorize the stmt.

/* Function vect_determine_vectorization_factor

   Determine the vectorization factor (VF). VF is the number of data elements
   that are operated upon in parallel in a single iteration of the vectorized
   loop. For example, when vectorizing a loop that operates on 4byte elements,
   on a target with vector size (VS) 16byte, the VF is set to 4, since 4
   elements can fit in a single vector register.

   We currently support vectorization of loops in which all types operated upon
   are of the same size. Therefore this function currently sets VF according to
   the size of the types operated upon, and fails if there are multiple sizes
   in the loop.

   VF is also the factor by which the loop iterations are strip-mined, e.g.:
   original loop:
        for (i=0; i<N; i++){
          a[i] = b[i] + c[i];
        }

   vectorized loop:
        for (i=0; i<N; i+=VF){
          a[i:VF] = b[i:VF] + c[i:VF];
        }

     2. The vectorizer then checks if a prologue is required.  If the

     be done before the prologue check.

       if (cost <= th)

     Hence the run-time scalar cost is incremented by a taken branch,
     plus a not-taken branch, plus a taken branch cost.

     3. The vectorizer then checks if an epilogue is required.  If the
     cost model check was not done before during prologue check, it
     has to be done with the epilogue check.

       if (prologue == 0)

       vector code:
         if ((cost <= th) | (scalar_iters-prologue-epilogue == 0))

     Hence the run-time scalar cost should be incremented by 2 taken

/* Function get_initial_def_for_reduction

   Input:
   STMT - a stmt that performs a reduction operation in the loop.
   INIT_VAL - the initial value of the reduction variable

   Output:
   ADJUSTMENT_DEF - a tree that holds a value to be added to the final result
        of the reduction (used for adjusting the epilog - see below).
   Return a vector variable, initialized according to the operation that STMT
        performs. This vector will be used as the initial value of the
        vector of partial results.

   Option1 (adjust in epilog): Initialize the vector as follows:
     add/bit or/xor:    [0,0,...,0,0]
     mult/bit and:      [1,1,...,1,1]
     min/max/cond_expr: [init_val,init_val,..,init_val,init_val]
   and when necessary (e.g. add/mult case) let the caller know
   that it needs to adjust the result by init_val.

   Option2: Initialize the vector as follows:
     add/bit or/xor:    [init_val,0,0,...,0]
     mult/bit and:      [init_val,1,1,...,1]
     min/max/cond_expr: [init_val,init_val,...,init_val]
   and no adjustments are needed.

   For example, for the following code:

   s = init_val;
   for (i=0;i<n;i++)
     s = s + a[i];

   STMT is 's = s + a[i]', and the reduction variable is 's'.
   For a vector of 4 units, we want to return either [0,0,0,init_val],
   or [0,0,0,0] and let the caller know that it needs to adjust
   the result at the end by 'init_val'.

   FORNOW, we are using the 'adjust in epilog' scheme, because this way the
   initialization vector is simpler (same element in all entries), if
   ADJUSTMENT_DEF is not NULL, and Option2 otherwise.

   A cost model should help decide between these two schemes.  */

/* Function vect_create_epilog_for_reduction

   Create code at the loop-epilog to finalize the result of a reduction
   computation.

   VECT_DEF is a vector of partial results.
   REDUC_CODE is the tree-code for the epilog reduction.
   NCOPIES is > 1 in case the vectorization factor (VF) is bigger than the
     number of elements that we can fit in a vectype (nunits). In this case
     we have to generate more than one vector stmt - i.e - we need to "unroll"
     the vector stmt by a factor VF/nunits.  For more details see documentation
     in vectorizable_operation.
   STMT is the scalar reduction stmt that is being vectorized.
   REDUCTION_PHI is the phi-node that carries the reduction computation.
   REDUC_INDEX is the index of the operand in the right hand side of the
     statement that is defined by REDUCTION_PHI.
   DOUBLE_REDUC is TRUE if double reduction phi nodes should be handled.

   This function:
   1. Creates the reduction def-use cycle: sets the arguments for
      REDUCTION_PHI:
      The loop-entry argument is the vectorized initial-value of the reduction.
      The loop-latch argument is VECT_DEF - the vector of partial sums.
   2. "Reduces" the vector of partial results VECT_DEF into a single result,
      by applying the operation specified by REDUC_CODE if available, or by
      other means (whole-vector shifts or a scalar loop).
      The function also creates a new phi node at the loop exit to preserve
      loop-closed form, as illustrated below.

     The flow at the entry to this function:

        loop:
          vec_def = phi <null, null>            # REDUCTION_PHI
          VECT_DEF = vector_stmt                # vectorized form of STMT
          s_loop = scalar_stmt                  # (scalar) STMT
        loop_exit:
          s_out0 = phi <s_loop>                 # (scalar) EXIT_PHI
          use <s_out0>
          use <s_out0>

     The above is transformed by this function into:

        loop:
          vec_def = phi <vec_init, VECT_DEF>    # REDUCTION_PHI
          VECT_DEF = vector_stmt                # vectorized form of STMT
          s_loop = scalar_stmt                  # (scalar) STMT
        loop_exit:
          s_out0 = phi <s_loop>                 # (scalar) EXIT_PHI
          v_out1 = phi <VECT_DEF>               # NEW_EXIT_PHI
          v_out2 = reduce <v_out1>
          s_out3 = extract_field <v_out2, 0>
          s_out4 = adjust_result <s_out3>
          use <s_out4>

  /*** 2. Create epilog code
	  The reduction epilog code operates across the elements of the vector
          of partial results computed by the vectorized loop.
          The reduction epilog code consists of:
          step 1: compute the scalar result in a vector (v_out2)
          step 2: extract the scalar result (s_out3) from the vector (v_out2)
          step 3: adjust the scalar result (s_out3) if needed.

          Step 1 can be accomplished using one the following three schemes:
          (scheme 1) using reduc_code, if available.
          (scheme 2) using whole-vector shifts, if available.
          (scheme 3) using a scalar loop. In this case steps 1+2 above are
                     combined.

          The overall epilog code looks like this:

          s_out0 = phi <s_loop>         # original EXIT_PHI
          v_out1 = phi <VECT_DEF>       # NEW_EXIT_PHI
          v_out2 = reduce <v_out1>              # step 1
          s_out3 = extract_field <v_out2, 0>    # step 2
          s_out4 = adjust_result <s_out3>       # step 3

          (step 3 is optional, and steps 1 and 2 may be combined).
          Lastly, the uses of s_out0 are replaced by s_out4.

/* Function vectorizable_reduction.

   Check if STMT performs a reduction operation that can be vectorized.
   If VEC_STMT is also passed, vectorize the STMT: create a vectorized
   stmt to replace it, put it in VEC_STMT, and insert it at GSI.
   Return FALSE if not a vectorizable STMT, TRUE otherwise.

   This function also handles reduction idioms (patterns) that have been
   recognized in advance during vect_pattern_recog. In this case, STMT may be
   of this form:
     X = pattern_expr (arg0, arg1, ..., X)
   and it's STMT_VINFO_RELATED_STMT points to the last stmt in the original
   sequence that had been detected and replaced by the pattern-stmt (STMT).

   In some cases of reduction patterns, the type of the reduction variable X is
   different than the type of the other arguments of STMT.
   In such cases, the vectype that is used when transforming STMT into a vector
   stmt is different than the vectype that is used to determine the
   vectorization factor, because it consists of a different number of elements
   than the actual number of elements that are being operated upon in parallel.

   For example, consider an accumulation of shorts into an int accumulator.
   On some targets it's possible to vectorize this pattern operating on 8
   shorts at a time (hence, the vectype for purposes of determining the
   vectorization factor should be V8HI); on the other hand, the vectype that
   is used to create the vector form is actually V4SI (the type of the result).

   Upon entry to this function, STMT_VINFO_VECTYPE records the vectype that
   indicates what is the actual level of parallelism (V8HI in the example), so
   that the right vectorization factor would be derived. This vectype
   corresponds to the type of arguments to the reduction stmt, and should *NOT*
   be used to create the vectorized stmt. The right vectype for the vectorized
   stmt is obtained from the type of the result X:
        get_vectype_for_scalar_type (TREE_TYPE (X))

   This means that, contrary to "regular" reductions (or "regular" stmts in
   general), the following equation:
      STMT_VINFO_VECTYPE == get_vectype_for_scalar_type (TREE_TYPE (X))
   does *NOT* necessarily hold for reduction patterns.  */

          If STMT represents a reduction pattern, then the type of the
          reduction variable may be different than the type of the rest
          of the arguments.  For example, consider the case of accumulation
          of shorts into an int accumulator; The original code:
                        S1: int_a = (int) short_a;
          orig_stmt->   S2: int_acc = plus <int_a ,int_acc>;

          was replaced with:
                        STMT: int_acc = widen_sum <short_a, int_acc>

          This means that:
          1. The tree-code that is used to create the vector operation in the
             epilog code (that reduces the partial results) is not the
             tree-code of STMT, but is rather the tree-code of the original
             stmt from the pattern that STMT is replacing. I.e, in the example
             above we want to use 'widen_sum' in the loop, but 'plus' in the
             epilog.
          2. The type (mode) we use to check available target support
             for the vector operation to be created in the *epilog*, is
             determined by the type of the reduction variable (in the example
             above we'd check this: plus_optab[vect_int_mode]).
             However the type (mode) we use to check available target support
