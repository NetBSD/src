# On Debian, Ubuntu and other derivative distributions, the 32bit libraries
# are found in /lib32 and /usr/lib32, /lib64 and /usr/lib64 are symlinks to
# /lib and /usr/lib, while other distributions install libraries into /lib64
# and /usr/lib64.  The LSB does not enforce the use of /lib64 and /usr/lib64,
# it doesn't tell anything about the 32bit libraries on those systems.  Set
# MULTILIB_OSDIRNAMES according to what is found on the target.
