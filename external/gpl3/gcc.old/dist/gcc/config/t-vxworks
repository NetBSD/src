# VxWorks system environments have been GCC based for a long time and we need
# to make sure that our files and the system ones use distinct macro names to
# protect against recursive inclusions.  We achieve this by temporarily
# substituting the headers used by stmp-int-headers with alternative versions
# where we add some version indication in the inclusion-protection macro
# names.

# Before the standard stmp-int-headers operations take place, arrange to
# copy the current version of the relevant header files locally, generate
# the alternate version and replace the original version with ours:

stmp-int-hdrs: subst-glimits.h

subst-%.h:
	cp -p $(srcdir)/$*.h orig-$*.h
	ID=$$(echo $(BASEVER_c) | sed -e 's/\./_/g'); \
	sed -e "s/_LIMITS_H__/_LIMITS_H_$${ID}_/" < $(srcdir)/$*.h > $@
	cp $@ $(srcdir)/$*.h

# Then arrange to restore the original versions after the standard
# operations have taken place:

INSTALL_HEADERS += restore-glimits.h
