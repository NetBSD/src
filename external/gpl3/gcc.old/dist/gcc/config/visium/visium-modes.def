/* Add any extra modes needed to represent the condition code.

   On the Visium, we have a "no-overflow" mode which is used when arithmetic
   instructions set the condition code.  Different branches are used in this
   case for some operations.

   We also have a "bit-test" mode which is used when the bit-test instruction
   sets the condition code.

   We also have two modes to indicate that the condition code is set by the
   the floating-point unit.  One for comparisons which generate an exception
   if the result is unordered (CCFPEmode) and one for comparisons which never
   generate such an exception (CCFPmode).  */
