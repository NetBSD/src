/* This is a list of ISA extentsions in AArch64.

   Before using #include to read this file, define a macro:

      AARCH64_OPT_EXTENSION(EXT_NAME, FLAG_CANONICAL, FLAGS_ON, FLAGS_OFF, FEATURE_STRING)

   EXT_NAME is the name of the extension, represented as a string constant.
   FLAGS_CANONICAL is the canonical internal name for this flag.
   FLAGS_ON are the bitwise-or of the features that enabling the extension
   adds, or zero if enabling this extension has no effect on other features.
   FLAGS_OFF are the bitwise-or of the features that disabling the extension
   removes, or zero if disabling this extension has no effect on other
   features.
   FEAT_STRING is a string containing the entries in the 'Features' field of
   /proc/cpuinfo on a GNU/Linux system that correspond to this architecture
   extension being available.  Sometimes multiple entries are needed to enable
   the extension (for example, the 'crypto' extension depends on four
   entries: aes, pmull, sha1, sha2 being present).  In that case this field
   should contain a space (" ") separated list of the strings in 'Features'
   that are required.  Their order is not important.  */
