/* This avr-specific pass (re)computes insn notes, in particular REG_DEAD
   notes which are used by `avr.c::reg_unused_after' and branch offset
   computations.  These notes must be correct, i.e. there must be no
   dangling REG_DEAD notes; otherwise wrong code might result, cf. PR64331.

   DF needs (correct) CFG, hence right before free_cfg is the last
   opportunity to rectify notes.  */

/* casesi uses a SImode switch index which is quite costly as most code will
   work on HImode or QImode.  The following pass runs right after .expand and
   tries to fix such situations by operating on the original mode.  This
   reduces code size and register pressure.

   The assertion is that the code generated by casesi is unaltered and a
   a sign-extend or zero-extend from QImode or HImode precedes the casesi
   insns withaout any insns in between.  */
