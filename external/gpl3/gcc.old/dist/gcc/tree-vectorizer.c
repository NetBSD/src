/* Loop and basic block vectorizer.

  This file contains drivers for the three vectorizers:
  (1) loop vectorizer (inter-iteration parallelism),
  (2) loop-aware SLP (intra-iteration parallelism) (invoked by the loop
      vectorizer)
  (3) BB vectorizer (out-of-loops), aka SLP

  The rest of the vectorizer's code is organized as follows:
  - tree-vect-loop.c - loop specific parts such as reductions, etc. These are
    used by drivers (1) and (2).
  - tree-vect-loop-manip.c - vectorizer's loop control-flow utilities, used by
    drivers (1) and (2).
  - tree-vect-slp.c - BB vectorization specific analysis and transformation,
    used by drivers (2) and (3).
  - tree-vect-stmts.c - statements analysis and transformation (used by all).
  - tree-vect-data-refs.c - vectorizer specific data-refs analysis and
    manipulations (used by all).
  - tree-vect-patterns.c - vectorizable code patterns detector (used by all)

  Here's a poor attempt at illustrating that:

     tree-vectorizer.c:
     loop_vect()  loop_aware_slp()  slp_vect()
          |        /           \          /
          |       /             \        /
          tree-vect-loop.c  tree-vect-slp.c
                | \      \  /      /   |
                |  \      \/      /    |

                |    \   /  \   /      |
