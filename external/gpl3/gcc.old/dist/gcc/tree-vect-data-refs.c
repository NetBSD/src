/* Return the smallest scalar part of STMT.
   This is used to determine the vectype of the stmt. We generally set the
   vectype according to the type of the result (lhs). For stmts whose
   result-type is different than the type of the arguments (e.g., demotion,
   promotion), vectype will be reset appropriately (later).  Note that we have
   to visit the smallest datatype in this function, because that determines the
   VF. If the smallest datatype in the loop is present only as the rhs of a
   promotion operation - we'd miss it.
   Such a case, where a variable of this datatype does not appear in the lhs
   anywhere in the loop, can only occur if it's an invariant: e.g.:
   'int_x = (int) short_inv', which we'd expect to have been optimized away by
   invariant motion. However, we cannot rely on invariant motion to always take
   invariants out of the loop, and so in the case of promotion we also have to
   check the rhs.
   LHS_SIZE_UNIT and RHS_SIZE_UNIT contain the sizes of the corresponding
   types.  */

/* Function vect_enhance_data_refs_alignment

   This pass will use loop versioning and loop peeling in order to enhance
   the alignment of data references in the loop.

   FOR NOW: we assume that whatever versioning/peeling takes place, only the
   original loop is to be vectorized; Any other loops that are created by
   the transformations performed in this pass - are not supposed to be
   vectorized. This restriction will be relaxed.

   This pass will require a cost model to guide it whether to apply peeling
   or versioning or a combination of the two. For example, the scheme that
   intel uses when given a loop with several memory accesses, is as follows:
   choose one memory access ('p') which alignment you want to force by doing
   peeling. Then, either (1) generate a loop in which 'p' is aligned and all
   other accesses are not necessarily aligned, or (2) use loop versioning to
   generate one loop in which all accesses are aligned, and another loop in
   which only 'p' is necessarily aligned.

   ("Automatic Intra-Register Vectorization for the Intel Architecture",
   Aart J.C. Bik, Milind Girkar, Paul M. Grey and Ximmin Tian, International
   Journal of Parallel Programming, Vol. 30, No. 2, April 2002.)

   Devising a cost model is the most critical aspect of this work. It will
   guide us on which access to peel for, whether to use loop versioning, how
   many versions to create, etc. The cost model will probably consist of
   generic considerations as well as target specific considerations (on
   powerpc for example, misaligned stores are more painful than misaligned
   loads).

   Here are the general steps involved in alignment enhancements:

     -- original loop, before alignment analysis:
	for (i=0; i<N; i++){
	  x = q[i];			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(q) = unknown
	  p[i] = y;			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(p) = unknown
	}

     -- After vect_compute_data_refs_alignment:
	for (i=0; i<N; i++){
	  x = q[i];			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(q) = 3
	  p[i] = y;			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(p) = unknown
	}

     -- Possibility 1: we do loop versioning:
     if (p is aligned) {
	for (i=0; i<N; i++){	# loop 1A
	  x = q[i];			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(q) = 3
	  p[i] = y;			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(p) = 0
	}
     }
     else {
	for (i=0; i<N; i++){	# loop 1B
	  x = q[i];			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(q) = 3
	  p[i] = y;			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(p) = unaligned
	}
     }

     -- Possibility 2: we do loop peeling:
     for (i = 0; i < 3; i++){	# (scalar loop, not to be vectorized).
	x = q[i];
	p[i] = y;
     }
     for (i = 3; i < N; i++){	# loop 2A
	x = q[i];			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(q) = 0
	p[i] = y;			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(p) = unknown
     }

     -- Possibility 3: combination of loop peeling and versioning:
     for (i = 0; i < 3; i++){	# (scalar loop, not to be vectorized).
	x = q[i];
	p[i] = y;
     }
     if (p is aligned) {
	for (i = 3; i<N; i++){	# loop 3A
	  x = q[i];			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(q) = 0
	  p[i] = y;			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(p) = 0
	}
     }
     else {
	for (i = 3; i<N; i++){	# loop 3B
	  x = q[i];			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(q) = 0
	  p[i] = y;			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(p) = unaligned
	}
     }

     These loops are later passed to loop_transform to be vectorized. The
     vectorizer will use the alignment information to guide the transformation
     (whether to generate regular loads/stores, or with special handling for
     misalignment).  */

/* Function vect_create_data_ref_ptr.

   Create a new pointer to vector type (vp), that points to the first location
   accessed in the loop by STMT, along with the def-use update chain to
   appropriately advance the pointer through the loop iterations. Also set
   aliasing information for the pointer.  This vector pointer is used by the
   callers to this function to create a memory reference expression for vector
   load/store access.

   Input:
   1. STMT: a stmt that references memory. Expected to be of the form
         GIMPLE_ASSIGN <name, data-ref> or
	 GIMPLE_ASSIGN <data-ref, name>.
   2. AT_LOOP: the loop where the vector memref is to be created.
   3. OFFSET (optional): an offset to be added to the initial address accessed
        by the data-ref in STMT.
   4. ONLY_INIT: indicate if vp is to be updated in the loop, or remain
        pointing to the initial address.
   5. TYPE: if not NULL indicates the required type of the data-ref.

   Output:
   1. Declare a new ptr to vector_type, and have it point to the base of the
      data reference (initial addressed accessed by the data reference).
      For example, for vector of type V8HI, the following code is generated:

      v8hi *vp;
      vp = (v8hi *)initial_address;

      if OFFSET is not supplied:
         initial_address = &a[init];
      if OFFSET is supplied:
         initial_address = &a[init + OFFSET];

      Return the initial_address in INITIAL_ADDRESS.

   2. If ONLY_INIT is true, just return the initial pointer.  Otherwise, also
      update the pointer in each iteration of the loop.

      Return the increment stmt that updates the pointer in PTR_INCR.

   3. Set INV_P to true if the access pattern of the data reference in the
      vectorized loop is invariant. Set it to false otherwise.

   4. Return the pointer.  */

   Given a chain of interleaved stores in DR_CHAIN of LENGTH that must be
   a power of 2, generate interleave_high/low stmts to reorder the data
   correctly for the stores. Return the final references for stores in
   RESULT_CHAIN.

   E.g., LENGTH is 4 and the scalar type is short, i.e., VF is 8.
   The input is 4 vectors each containing 8 elements. We assign a number to each
   element, the input sequence is:

   1st vec:   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
   2nd vec:   8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15
   3rd vec:  16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
   4th vec:  24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31

   The output sequence should be:

   1st vec:  0  8 16 24  1  9 17 25
   2nd vec:  2 10 18 26  3 11 19 27
   3rd vec:  4 12 20 28  5 13 21 30
   4th vec:  6 14 22 30  7 15 23 31

   i.e., we interleave the contents of the four vectors in their order.

   We use interleave_high/low instructions to create such output. The input of
   each interleave_high/low operation is two vectors:
   1st vec    2nd vec
   0 1 2 3    4 5 6 7
   the even elements of the result vector are obtained left-to-right from the
   high/low elements of the first vector. The odd elements of the result are
   obtained left-to-right from the high/low elements of the second vector.
   The output of interleave_high will be:   0 4 1 5
   and of interleave_low:                   2 6 3 7


   The permutation is done in log LENGTH stages. In each stage interleave_high
   and interleave_low stmts are created for each pair of vectors in DR_CHAIN,
   where the first argument is taken from the first half of DR_CHAIN and the
   second argument from it's second half.
   In our example,

   I1: interleave_high (1st vec, 3rd vec)
   I2: interleave_low (1st vec, 3rd vec)
   I3: interleave_high (2nd vec, 4th vec)
   I4: interleave_low (2nd vec, 4th vec)

   The output for the first stage is:

   I1:  0 16  1 17  2 18  3 19
   I2:  4 20  5 21  6 22  7 23
   I3:  8 24  9 25 10 26 11 27
   I4: 12 28 13 29 14 30 15 31

   The output of the second stage, i.e. the final result is:

/* Function vect_setup_realignment

   This function is called when vectorizing an unaligned load using
   the dr_explicit_realign[_optimized] scheme.
   This function generates the following code at the loop prolog:

      p = initial_addr;
   x  msq_init = *(floor(p));   # prolog load
      realignment_token = call target_builtin;
    loop:
   x  msq = phi (msq_init, ---)

   The stmts marked with x are generated only for the case of
   dr_explicit_realign_optimized.

   The code above sets up a new (vector) pointer, pointing to the first
   location accessed by STMT, and a "floor-aligned" load using that pointer.
   It also generates code to compute the "realignment-token" (if the relevant
   target hook was defined), and creates a phi-node at the loop-header bb
   whose arguments are the result of the prolog-load (created by this
   function) and the result of a load that takes place in the loop (to be
   created by the caller to this function).

   For the case of dr_explicit_realign_optimized:
   The caller to this function uses the phi-result (msq) to create the
   realignment code inside the loop, and sets up the missing phi argument,
   as follows:
    loop:
      msq = phi (msq_init, lsq)
      lsq = *(floor(p'));        # load in loop
      result = realign_load (msq, lsq, realignment_token);

   For the case of dr_explicit_realign:
    loop:
      msq = *(floor(p)); 	# load in loop
      p' = p + (VS-1);
      lsq = *(floor(p'));	# load in loop
      result = realign_load (msq, lsq, realignment_token);

   Input:
   STMT - (scalar) load stmt to be vectorized. This load accesses
          a memory location that may be unaligned.
   BSI - place where new code is to be inserted.
   ALIGNMENT_SUPPORT_SCHEME - which of the two misalignment handling schemes
			      is used.

   Output:
   REALIGNMENT_TOKEN - the result of a call to the builtin_mask_for_load
                       target hook, if defined.
   Return value - the result of the loop-header phi node.  */

     calculation will be generated by this function, outside the loop (in the
     preheader).  Otherwise, INIT_ADDR had already been computed for us by the
     caller, inside the loop.

     Background: If the misalignment remains fixed throughout the iterations of
     the loop, then both realignment schemes are applicable, and also the
     misalignment computation can be done outside LOOP.  This is because we are
     vectorizing LOOP, and so the memory accesses in LOOP advance in steps that
     are a multiple of VS (the Vector Size), and therefore the misalignment in
     different vectorized LOOP iterations is always the same.
     The problem arises only if the memory access is in an inner-loop nested
     inside LOOP, which is now being vectorized using outer-loop vectorization.
     This is the only case when the misalignment of the memory access may not
     remain fixed throughout the iterations of the inner-loop (as explained in
     detail in vect_supportable_dr_alignment).  In this case, not only is the
     optimized realignment scheme not applicable, but also the misalignment
     computation (and generation of the realignment token that is passed to
     REALIGN_LOAD) have to be done inside the loop.

     In short, INIT_ADDR indicates whether we are in a COMPUTE_IN_LOOP mode
     or not, which in turn determines if the misalignment is computed inside
     the inner-loop, or outside LOOP.  */

     For the optimized realignment scheme, instead of generating two vector
     loads in each iteration, we generate a single extra vector load in the
     preheader of the loop, and in each iteration reuse the result of the
     vector load from the previous iteration.  In case the memory access is in
     an inner-loop nested inside LOOP, which is now being vectorized using
     outer-loop vectorization, we need to determine whether this initial vector
     load should be generated at the preheader of the inner-loop, or can be
     generated at the preheader of LOOP.  If the memory access has no evolution
     in LOOP, it can be generated in the preheader of LOOP. Otherwise, it has

/* Function vect_permute_load_chain.

   Given a chain of interleaved loads in DR_CHAIN of LENGTH that must be
   a power of 2, generate extract_even/odd stmts to reorder the input data
   correctly. Return the final references for loads in RESULT_CHAIN.

   E.g., LENGTH is 4 and the scalar type is short, i.e., VF is 8.
   The input is 4 vectors each containing 8 elements. We assign a number to each
   element, the input sequence is:

   1st vec:   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
   2nd vec:   8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15
   3rd vec:  16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
   4th vec:  24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31

   The output sequence should be:

   1st vec:  0 4  8 12 16 20 24 28
   2nd vec:  1 5  9 13 17 21 25 29
   3rd vec:  2 6 10 14 18 22 26 30
   4th vec:  3 7 11 15 19 23 27 31

   i.e., the first output vector should contain the first elements of each
   interleaving group, etc.

   We use extract_even/odd instructions to create such output. The input of each
   extract_even/odd operation is two vectors
   1st vec    2nd vec
   0 1 2 3    4 5 6 7

   and the output is the vector of extracted even/odd elements. The output of
   extract_even will be:   0 2 4 6
   and of extract_odd:     1 3 5 7


   The permutation is done in log LENGTH stages. In each stage extract_even and
   extract_odd stmts are created for each pair of vectors in DR_CHAIN in their
   order. In our example,

   E1: extract_even (1st vec, 2nd vec)
   E2: extract_odd (1st vec, 2nd vec)
   E3: extract_even (3rd vec, 4th vec)
   E4: extract_odd (3rd vec, 4th vec)

   The output for the first stage will be:

   E1:  0  2  4  6  8 10 12 14
   E2:  1  3  5  7  9 11 13 15
   E3: 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30
   E4: 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31

   In order to proceed and create the correct sequence for the next stage (or
   for the correct output, if the second stage is the last one, as in our
   example), we first put the output of extract_even operation and then the
   output of extract_odd in RESULT_CHAIN (which is then copied to DR_CHAIN).
   The input for the second stage is:

   1st vec (E1):  0  2  4  6  8 10 12 14
   2nd vec (E3): 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30
   3rd vec (E2):  1  3  5  7  9 11 13 15
   4th vec (E4): 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31

   The output of the second stage:

   E1: 0 4  8 12 16 20 24 28
   E2: 2 6 10 14 18 22 26 30
   E3: 1 5  9 13 17 21 25 29
   E4: 3 7 11 15 19 23 27 31

   And RESULT_CHAIN after reordering:

   1st vec (E1):  0 4  8 12 16 20 24 28
   2nd vec (E3):  1 5  9 13 17 21 25 29
   3rd vec (E2):  2 6 10 14 18 22 26 30

  /* We can choose between using the implicit realignment scheme (generating
     a misaligned_move stmt) and the explicit realignment scheme (generating
     aligned loads with a REALIGN_LOAD). There are two variants to the explicit
     realignment scheme: optimized, and unoptimized.
     We can optimize the realignment only if the step between consecutive
     vector loads is equal to the vector size.  Since the vector memory
     accesses advance in steps of VS (Vector Size) in the vectorized loop, it
     is guaranteed that the misalignment amount remains the same throughout the
     execution of the vectorized loop.  Therefore, we can create the
     "realignment token" (the permutation mask that is passed to REALIGN_LOAD)
     at the loop preheader.

     However, in the case of outer-loop vectorization, when vectorizing a
     memory access in the inner-loop nested within the LOOP that is now being
     vectorized, while it is guaranteed that the misalignment of the
     vectorized memory access will remain the same in different outer-loop
     iterations, it is *not* guaranteed that is will remain the same throughout
     the execution of the inner-loop.  This is because the inner-loop advances
     with the original scalar step (and not in steps of VS).  If the inner-loop
     step happens to be a multiple of VS, then the misalignment remains fixed
     and we can use the optimized realignment scheme.  For example:

      for (i=0; i<N; i++)
        for (j=0; j<M; j++)
          s += a[i+j];

     When vectorizing the i-loop in the above example, the step between
     consecutive vector loads is 1, and so the misalignment does not remain
     fixed across the execution of the inner-loop, and the realignment cannot
     be optimized (as illustrated in the following pseudo vectorized loop):

      for (i=0; i<N; i+=4)
        for (j=0; j<M; j++){
          vs += vp[i+j]; // misalignment of &vp[i+j] is {0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,...}
                         // when j is {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,...} respectively.
                         // (assuming that we start from an aligned address).
          }

     We therefore have to use the unoptimized realignment scheme:

      for (i=0; i<N; i+=4)
          for (j=k; j<M; j+=4)
          vs += vp[i+j]; // misalignment of &vp[i+j] is always k (assuming
                           // that the misalignment of the initial address is
                           // 0).

     The loop can then be vectorized as follows:

      for (k=0; k<4; k++){
        rt = get_realignment_token (&vp[k]);
        for (i=0; i<N; i+=4){
          v1 = vp[i+k];
          for (j=k; j<M; j+=4){
            v2 = vp[i+j+VS-1];
            va = REALIGN_LOAD <v1,v2,rt>;
            vs += va;
            v1 = v2;
          }
        }
