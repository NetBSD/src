# We have at least one module in libgcc that depends on __SIZEOF_DOUBLE__
# or __SIZEOF_LONG_DOUBLE__ which means that t-avrlibc must not copy
# double32/64 or long-double32/64 variants from the vanilla one.
# This occurs when some module(s) define(s) weak aliases for functions
# that usually live in libm.
