   If LOC is *NOT* the location of a token resulting from the

   Location Resolution Kind) is ignored and the resulting location

   Now if LOC *IS* the location of a token resulting from the
   expansion of a macro, this is what happens.

   * If LRK is set to LRK_MACRO_EXPANSION_POINT
   -------------------------------

   The virtual location is resolved to the first macro expansion point
   that led to this macro expansion.

   * If LRK is set to LRK_SPELLING_LOCATION
   -------------------------------------

   The virtual location is resolved to the locus where the token has
   been spelled in the source.   This can follow through all the macro
   expansions that led to the token.

   * If LRK is set to LRK_MACRO_DEFINITION_LOCATION
   --------------------------------------

   The virtual location is resolved to the locus of the token in the
   context of the macro definition.

   If LOC is the locus of a token that is an argument of a
   function-like macro [replacing a parameter in the replacement list
   of the macro] the virtual location is resolved to the locus of the
   parameter that is replaced, in the context of the definition of the
   macro.

   If LOC is the locus of a token that is not an argument of a
   function-like macro, then the function behaves as if LRK was set to
   LRK_SPELLING_LOCATION.

   If LOC_MAP is not NULL, *LOC_MAP is set to the map encoding the
   returned location.  Note that if the returned location wasn't originally
   encoded by a map, the *MAP is set to NULL.  This can happen if LOC
   resolves to a location reserved for the client code, like
   UNKNOWN_LOCATION or BUILTINS_LOCATION in GCC.  */
