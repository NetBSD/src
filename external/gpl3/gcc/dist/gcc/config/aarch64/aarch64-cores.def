/* This is a list of cores that implement AArch64.

   Before using #include to read this file, define a macro:

      AARCH64_CORE(CORE_NAME, CORE_IDENT, ARCH, FLAGS, COSTS)

   The CORE_NAME is the name of the core, represented as a string constant.
   The CORE_IDENT is the name of the core, represented as an identifier.
   ARCH is the architecture revision implemented by the chip.
   FLAGS are the bitwise-or of the traits that apply to that core.
   This need not include flags implied by the architecture.
   COSTS is the name of the rtx_costs routine to use.  */

/* V8 Architecture Processors.
   This list currently contains example CPUs that implement AArch64, and
   therefore serves as a template for adding more CPUs in the future.  */
