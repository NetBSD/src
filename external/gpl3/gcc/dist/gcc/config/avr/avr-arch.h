AVR_ISA_RMW
  Only few avr devices have Read-Modify-Write (RMW) instructions
  (XCH, LAC, LAS and LAT)

AVR_SHORT_SP
  Stack Pointer has only 8 bit width.
  The device / multilib has an 8-bit stack pointer (no SPH).

AVR_ERRATA_SKIP
  Some AVR devices have a core erratum when skipping a 2-word instruction.
  Skip instructions are:  SBRC, SBRS, SBIC, SBIS, CPSE.
  Problems will occur with return address is IRQ executes during the
  skip sequence.

  A support ticket from Atmel returned the following information:

     Subject: (ATTicket:644469) On AVR skip-bug core Erratum
     From: avr@atmel.com                    Date: 2011-07-27
     (Please keep the subject when replying to this mail)

     This errata exists only in AT90S8515 and ATmega103 devices.
