/* This is a list of cores that implement RISC-V.

   Before using #include to read this file, define a macro:

      RISCV_CORE(CORE_NAME, ARCH, MICRO_ARCH, TUNE_INFO)

   The CORE_NAME is the name of the core, represented as a string.
   The ARCH is the default arch of the core, represented as a string,
   can be NULL if no default arch.
   The MICRO_ARCH is the name of the core for which scheduling decisions
   will be made, represented as an identifier.
   The TUNE_INFO is the detail cost model for this core, represented as an
   identifier, reference to riscv-tunes.def.  */
