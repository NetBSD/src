/* Helper routine for inverted_post_order_compute
   flow_dfs_compute_reverse_execute, and the reverse-CFG

   BB has to belong to a region of CFG
   unreachable by inverted traversal from the exit.
   i.e. there's no control flow path from ENTRY to EXIT
   that contains this BB.
   This can happen in two cases - if there's an infinite loop
   or if there's a block that has no successor
   (call to a function with no return).
   Some RTL passes deal with this condition by
   calling connect_infinite_loops_to_exit () and/or
   add_noreturn_fake_exit_edges ().
   However, those methods involve modifying the CFG itself
   which may not be desirable.
   Hence, we deal with the infinite loop/no return cases
   by identifying a unique basic block that can reach all blocks
   in such a region by inverted traversal.
   This function returns a basic block that guarantees
   that all blocks in the region are reachable

   If there's an infinite loop,
   a simple inverted traversal starting from the blocks

/* Compute dominance frontiers, ala Harvey, Ferrante, et al.

   This algorithm can be found in Timothy Harvey's PhD thesis, at
   http://www.cs.rice.edu/~harv/dissertation.pdf in the section on iterative
   dominance algorithms.

   First, we identify each join point, j (any node with more than one
   incoming edge is a join point).

   We then examine each predecessor, p, of j and walk up the dominator tree
   starting at p.

   We stop the walk when we reach j's immediate dominator - j is in the
   dominance frontier of each of  the nodes in the walk, except for j's
   immediate dominator. Intuitively, all of the rest of j's dominators are
   shared by j's predecessors as well.
   Since they dominate j, they will not have j in their dominance frontiers.

   The number of nodes touched by this algorithm is equal to the size
   of the dominance frontiers, no more, no less.
