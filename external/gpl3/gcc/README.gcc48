arch/feature list.  anything not here has been switched already:

architecture	tools	kernels	libgcc	native-gcc	make release	runs	atf

[1] ofppc/pegasos has issues with symtab loading.
    sandpoint works fine in multi-user, found an annoyance by com(4) change.
[3] relocations fail in libgcc
[4] cc1 gets segv compiling libgcc.
[7] m68k/vax/sh3 gcc seem to randomly get -fstack-protector/-Wstack-protector
    wrong, for example m68k flags alarm() as unprotected in
    libc/gen/alarm.c:53, vax ifinit() in sbin/routed/if.c:680.
   --> hacked around, now fixed?
[9] no kernels in evbcf port yet
