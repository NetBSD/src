lib:

	G_NOEXCEPTION_FLAGS -- need to use this

new stuff:
	cc1objcplus
	collect2 -- need to re-introduce?

	gcc-ar, -nm and -ranlib, for lto plugin stuff

	- what is libitm?

	- asan/libsanitizer

x86_64 port:
- copied manually i386-builtin-types.inc instead of generating it.

[1] ofppc/pegasos has issues with symtab loading.
    sandpoint works fine in multi-user, found an annoyance by com(4) change.
[2] weird failures.
[3] relocations fail in libgcc
[4] cc1 gets segv compiling libgcc.
[5] mips*eb kernels seem to work as well as gcc 4.5 ones.
[6] ia64 port is missing libc, libkvm and more support.  libgcc has some uncommited hacks.
[7] m68k/vax/sh3 gcc seem to randomly get -fstack-protector/-Wstack-protector
    wrong, for example m68k flags alarm() as unprotected in
    libc/gen/alarm.c:53, vax ifinit() in sbin/routed/if.c:680.
   --> hacked around
[8] LOONGSON kernel has general problems
[9] no kernels in evbcf port yet
