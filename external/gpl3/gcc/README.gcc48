new stuff:
	cc1objcplus
	collect2 -- need to re-introduce?

	gcc-ar, -nm and -ranlib, for lto plugin stuff

[1] ofppc/pegasos has issues with symtab loading.
    sandpoint works fine in multi-user, found an annoyance by com(4) change.
[2] a kernel has it's text overwritten by something before alpha_init
[3] relocations fail in libgcc
[4] mostly works, some tests fail.  same(?) has gcc 4.5
[5] mips*eb kernels seem to work as well as gcc 4.5 ones.
[7] shark atf-report fails with: Unexpected token `tc-start'; expected end of test program
[8] m68k/vax/sh3 gcc seem to randomly get -fstack-protector/-Wstack-protector
    wrong, for example m68k flags alarm() as unprotected in
    libc/gen/alarm.c:53, vax ifinit() in sbin/routed/if.c:680.
[9] LOONGSON kernel has general problems
[10] mips64el fails -- something in /sbin/init or /rescue/init jumps to zero.
    in -current.  a hack for o32 works.
[11] weird failures.
