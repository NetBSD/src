/* This module provides definitions used for creating and adding to
   the symbol table.  These routines are called from various symbol-
   file-reading routines.  This file holds the legacy API, which
   relies on a global variable to work properly.  New or maintained
   symbol readers should use the builder API in buildsym.h.

   The basic way this module is used is as follows:

   scoped_free_pendings free_pending;
   cust = start_compunit_symtab (...);
   ... read debug info ...
   cust = end_compunit_symtab (...);

   The compunit symtab pointer ("cust") is returned from both
   start_compunit_symtab and end_compunit_symtab to simplify the debug info readers.

   dbxread.c and xcoffread.c use another variation:

   scoped_free_pendings free_pending;
   cust = start_compunit_symtab (...);
   ... read debug info ...
   cust = end_compunit_symtab (...);
   ... start_compunit_symtab + read + end_compunit_symtab repeated ...
