/* This file is built for both GDBserver, and the in-process
   agent (IPA), a shared library that includes a tracing agent that is
   loaded by the inferior to support fast tracepoints.  Fast
   tracepoints (or more accurately, jump based tracepoints) are
   implemented by patching the tracepoint location with a jump into a
   small trampoline function whose job is to save the register state,
   call the in-process tracing agent, and then execute the original
   instruction that was under the tracepoint jump (possibly adjusted,
   if PC-relative, or some such).

   The current synchronization design is pull based.  That means,
   GDBserver does most of the work, by peeking/poking at the inferior
   agent's memory directly for downloading tracepoint and associated
   objects, and for uploading trace frames.  Whenever the IPA needs
   something from GDBserver (trace buffer is full, tracing stopped for
   some reason, etc.) the IPA calls a corresponding hook function
   where GDBserver has placed a breakpoint.

   Each of the agents has its own trace buffer.  When browsing the
   trace frames built from slow and fast tracepoints from GDB (tfind
   mode), there's no guarantee the user is seeing the trace frames in
   strict chronological creation order, although, GDBserver tries to
   keep the order relatively reasonable, by syncing the trace buffers
   at appropriate times.

   variable in size, they are never moved once created, and we only
   discard if we are doing a circular buffer, and then only the oldest
   ones.  Each trace frame includes its own size, so we don't need to

   first one, so we don't need to record numbers.  A trace frame also
   records the number of the tracepoint that created it.  The data
   itself is a series of blocks, each introduced by a single character
   and with a defined format.  Each type of block has enough
   type/length info to allow scanners to jump quickly from one block
   to the next without reading each byte in the block.  */

   case, the location of the first trace frame (trace_buffer_start)
   moves as old trace frames are discarded.  Also, since we grow trace
   frames incrementally as actions are performed, we wrap around to
   the beginning of the trace buffer.  This is per-block, so each
   block within a trace frame remains contiguous.  Things get messy

/* We have possibly both GDBserver and an inferior thread accessing
   the same IPA trace buffer memory.  The IPA is the producer (tries
   to put new frames in the buffer), while GDBserver occasionally
   consumes them, that is, flushes the IPA's buffer into its own
   buffer.  Both sides need to update the trace buffer control
   pointers (current head, tail, etc.).  We can't use a global lock to
   synchronize the accesses, as otherwise we could deadlock GDBserver
   (if the thread holding the lock stops for a signal, say).  So
   instead of that, we use a transaction scheme where GDBserver writes
   always prevail over the IPAs writes, and, we have the IPA detect
   the commit failure/overwrite, and retry the whole attempt.  This is
   mainly implemented by having a global token object that represents
   who wrote last to the buffer control structure.  We need to freeze
   any inferior writing to the buffer while GDBserver touches memory,
   so that the inferior can correctly detect that GDBserver had been
   there, otherwise, it could mistakingly think its commit was
   successful; that's implemented by simply having GDBserver set a
   breakpoint the inferior hits if it is the critical region.

   There are three cycling trace buffer control structure copies
   (buffer head, tail, etc.), with the token object including an index
   indicating which is current live copy.  The IPA tentatively builds
   an updated copy in a non-current control structure, while GDBserver
   always clobbers the current version directly.  The IPA then tries
   to atomically "commit" its version; if GDBserver clobbered the
   structure meanwhile, that will fail, and the IPA restarts the
   allocation process.

   Listing the step in further detail, we have:

  In-process agent (producer):

  - passes by `about_to_request_buffer_space' breakpoint/lock

  - reads current token, extracts current trace buffer control index,
    and starts tentatively updating the rightmost one (0->1, 1->2,
    2->0).  Note that only one inferior thread is executing this code
    at any given time, due to an outer lock in the jump pads.

  - updates counters, and tries to commit the token.

  - passes by second `about_to_request_buffer_space' breakpoint/lock,
    leaving the sync region.

  - checks if the update was effective.

  - if trace buffer was found full, hits flush_trace_buffer
    breakpoint, and restarts later afterwards.

  GDBserver (consumer):

  - sets `about_to_request_buffer_space' breakpoint/lock.

  - updates the token unconditionally, using the current buffer
    control index, since it knows that the IP agent always writes to
    the rightmost, and due to the breakpoint, at most one IP thread
    can try to update the trace buffer concurrently to GDBserver, so
    there will be no danger of trace buffer control index wrap making
    the IPA write to the same index as GDBserver.

  - flushes the IP agent's trace buffer completely, and updates the
    current trace buffer control structure.  GDBserver *always* wins.

  - removes the `about_to_request_buffer_space' breakpoint.

The token is stored in the `trace_buffer_ctrl_curr' variable.
Internally, it's bits are defined as:

 |-------------+-----+-------------+--------+-------------+--------------|
 | Bit offsets |  31 |   30 - 20   |   19   |    18-8     |     7-0      |
 |-------------+-----+-------------+--------+-------------+--------------|
 | What        | GSB | PC (11-bit) | unused | CC (11-bit) | TBCI (8-bit) |
 |-------------+-----+-------------+--------+-------------+--------------|

 GSB  - GDBserver Stamp Bit
 PC   - Previous Counter
 CC   - Current Counter
 TBCI - Trace Buffer Control Index


An IPA update of `trace_buffer_ctrl_curr' does:

    - read CC from the current token, save as PC.
    - updates pointers
    - atomically tries to write PC+1,CC

A GDBserver update of `trace_buffer_ctrl_curr' does:

    - reads PC and CC from the current token.
    - updates pointers
    - writes GSB,PC,CC
