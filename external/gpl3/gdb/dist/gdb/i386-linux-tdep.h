  extended state mask, which is the same as the extended control register
  0 (the XFEATURE_ENABLED_MASK register), XCR0.  We can use this mask
  together with the mask saved in the xstate_hdr_bytes to determine what
  states the processor/OS supports and what state, used or initialized,
  the process/thread is in.  */
