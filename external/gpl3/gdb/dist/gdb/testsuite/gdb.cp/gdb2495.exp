# In gdb inferior function calls, if a C++ exception is raised in the
# dummy-frame, and the exception handler is (normally, and expected to
# be) out-of-frame, the default C++ handler will (wrongly) be called
# in an inferior function call.
# This is incorrect as an exception can normally and legally be handled
# out-of-frame.  The confines of the dummy frame prevent the unwinder
# from finding the correct handler (or any handler, unless it is
# in-frame).  The default handler calls std::terminate.  This will kill
# the inferior.  Assert that terminate should never be called in an
# inferior function call.  These tests test the functionality around
# unwinding that sequence and also tests the flag behaviour gating this
# functionality.
