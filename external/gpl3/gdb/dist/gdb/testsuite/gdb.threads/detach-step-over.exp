# Test detaching from a process that is running and has threads
# constantly hitting a breakpoint and stepping over it, in all
# combinations of:
#
#  - maint target non-stop off/on
#  - set non-stop on/off
#  - displaced stepping on/off
#
# This stresses the edge cases of detaching while a displaced step or
# an in-line step over are in progress.
#
# A fail mode is that the inferior process dies after being detached.
# This can happen because e.g.:
#
# - GDB leaves a breakpoint installed behind, or
#
# - GDB leaves a thread running in the displaced step scratch buffer.
#   With no debugger around to run the finish step, the thread runs
#   off of the scratch buffer, with undefined results.
#
# To exercise this, the testcase reattaches to the process shortly
# after detaching, ensuring the process is still alive and well.
#
# In addition, since GDB may pause threads of all processes for
# stepping over a breakpoint, it needs to re-resume all threads if it
# detaches from the process that was just stepping over the
# breakpoint.  To ensure that, the testcase actually runs a second
# process at the same time as the one that is used to test detaching.
# After the first process is detached, the testcase sends a SIGUSR1 to
# the second process.  If threads failed to be resumed, then the
# SIGUSR1 is never reported to the user, resulting in timeout.  The
# threads of this second process will also be constantly stepping over
# a breakpoint, which has helped with exposing further corner case
# bugs.
