   Check that hardware watchpoints get correctly replicated to all
   existing threads when hardware watchpoints are created.  This test
   creates one hardware watchpoint per thread until a maximum is
   reached.  It originally addresses a deficiency seen on embedded
   powerpc targets with slotted hardware *point designs.
