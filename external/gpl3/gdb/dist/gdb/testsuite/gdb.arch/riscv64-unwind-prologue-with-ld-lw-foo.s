/* This testcase contains a function where the 'ld', 'c.ld', 'lw' or 'c.lw'
   instruction is used in the prologue before the RA register have been saved
   on the stack.

   This mimics a pattern observed in the __pthread_clockjoin_ex function
   in libpthread.so.0 (from glibc-2.33-0ubuntu5) where a canary value is
   loaded and placed on the stack in order to detect stack smashing.

   The skeleton for this file was generated using the following command:

      gcc -x c -S -c -o - - <<EOT
        static long int __canary = 42;
        extern int bar ();
        int foo () { return bar(); }
      EOT

   The result of this command is modified in the following way:
     - The prologue is adapted to reserve 16 more bytes on the stack.
     - A part that simulates the installation of a canary on the stack is
       added.  The canary is loaded multiple times to simulate the use of
       various instructions that could do the work (ld or c.ld for a 64 bit
       canary, lw or c.lw for a 32 bit canary).
     - The epilogue is adjusted to be able to return properly.  The epilogue
       does not check the canary value since this testcase is only interested
       in ensuring GDB can scan the prologue.  */
