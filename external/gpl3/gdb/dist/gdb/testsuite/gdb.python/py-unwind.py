        This unwinder can unwind the frames that have been deliberately
        corrupted in a specific way (functions in the accompanying
        py-unwind.c file do that.)
        This code is only on AMD64.
        On AMD64 $RBP points to the innermost frame (unless the code
        was compiled with -fomit-frame-pointer), which contains the
        address of the previous frame at offset 0. The functions
        deliberately corrupt their frames as follows:
                     Before                 After
                   Corruption:           Corruption:
                +--------------+       +--------------+
        RBP-8   |              |       | Previous RBP |
