# GDB support routines for a board using the MIPS remote debugging
# protocol.  These are actually pretty generic.

# DejaGnu currently assumes that debugging is being done over the main
# console port.  It would probably be more convenient for people using
# IDT boards to permit the debugging port and the connected port to be
# different, since an IDT board has two ports.  This would require
# extending some of the tests in a fashion similar to that done for
# VxWorks, because the test output would appear on the other port,
# rather than being displayed by gdb.
