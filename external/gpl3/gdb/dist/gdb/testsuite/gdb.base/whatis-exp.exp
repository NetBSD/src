# tests for whatis command on expressions.
# used in file eval.c. This flavor of whatis
# command performs evaluation of expressions w/o actually
# computing the value, but just the type
# of the result. It goes through the evaluate_subexp_standard
# with the EVAL_AVOID_SIDE_EFFECTS flag rather than EVAL_NORMAL
#

# test running programs
