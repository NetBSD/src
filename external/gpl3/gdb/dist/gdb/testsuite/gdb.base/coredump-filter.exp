# We do not do file-backed mappings in the test program, but it is

# load GDB with a corefile but without a binary, and then ask for the
# disassemble of a function (i.e., the binary's .text section).  GDB
# should fail in this case.  However, it must succeed if the binary is
# provided along with the corefile.  This is what we test here.
#
# A further complication is that Linux NT_FILE notes are now read from
# the corefile.  This note allows GDB to find the binary for file
# backed mappings even though the binary wasn't loaded by GDB in the
# conventional manner.  In order to see the expected failure for this
# case, we rename the binary in order to perform this test.
