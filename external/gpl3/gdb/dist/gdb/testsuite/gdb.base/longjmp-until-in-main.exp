# Test "until LINE", started in the "main()" frame, where the until
# command runs into a longjmp that lands in a frame that is inner than
# main.  GDB internally intercepts the longjmp, sets a breakpoint at
# the jump destination, and once there, decides whether to stop or
# ignore the breakpoint hit depending on whether the initiating frame
# is present on the frame chain.  GDB used to have a bug where it
# recorded the frame of the caller of main instead of the frame of
# main as the initiating frame, and then later on when deciding
# whether the longjmp landed somewhere inner than main, since
# unwinding normally stops at main, GDB would fail to find the
# initiating frame.
