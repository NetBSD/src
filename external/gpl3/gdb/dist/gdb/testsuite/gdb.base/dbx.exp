# In "testsuite/config/unix-gdb.exp", the routine "gdb_load"
# is defined as "gdb_file_cmd".  The binding of "gdb_file_cmd"
# is done at invocation time.  Before this file is processed,
# it binds to the definition in "testsuite/lib/gdb.exp"; after
# this file is processed, it binds to this definition.
# TCL lets us overrides a previous routine definition without a
# warning (isn't that special?).
#
# This means that tests before use "file" to load a target, and
# tests afterwards use the pair "symbol-file" "exec-file".
#
# I'm leaving it as it is for now because at the moment it
# is the only test we have of the use of the combination of
# "symbol-file" and "exec-file" to load a debugging target (the
# other definition uses "file". 
#
# Symbol-file and exec-file should be tested explicitly, not
# as a side effect of running a particular test (in this case,
# "testsuite/gdb.compat/dbx.exp").
#
# CM: Renamed the procedure so it does not override the orginal file name.
#     Having the test suite change behavior depending on the tests run makes
#     it extremely difficult to reproduce errors. I've also added a
#     "dbx_gdb_load" procedure.  This and only this test will call these
#     procedures now. I also added an "expect" to the "send exec-file" line.
#     The "expect" waits for a prompt to appear. Otherwise, if the tests run
#     too quickly, the caller could send another command before the prompt
#     of this command returns, causing the test to get out of sync and fail
#     seemingly randomly or only on a loaded system.
#
# Problem is, though, that the testsuite config files can override the definition of
# gdb_load (without notice, as was mentioned above). Unfortunately, the gdb_load proc
# that was copied into this test was a copy of the unix native version.
#
# The real problem that we're attempting to solve is how to load an exec and symbol
# file into gdb for a dbx session. So why not just override gdb_file_cmd with the
# right sequence of events, allowing gdb_load to do its normal thing? This way
# remotes and simulators will work, too.
#
# [drow 2002-03-30]: We can restore the old gdb_file_cmd afterwards, though.
