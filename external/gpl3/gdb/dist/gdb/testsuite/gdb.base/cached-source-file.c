/* Test for PR tui/25126.

   The bug is about a regression that makes GDB not reload its source
   code cache when the inferior's symbols are reloaded, which leads to
   wrong backtraces/listings.

   This bug is reproducible even without using the TUI.

   The .exp testcase depends on the line numbers and contents from
   this file  If you change this file, make sure to double-check the
   testcase.  */
