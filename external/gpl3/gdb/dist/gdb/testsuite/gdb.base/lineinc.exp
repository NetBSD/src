# The test program lineinc.c contains a mix of #line directives and
# #include directives that will cause the compiler to attribute more
# than one #inclusion to the same source line.  You can get similar
# effects using things like GCC's '-imacros' flag.
#
# Compiling lineinc.c with Dwarf 2 macro information will produce
# something like this:
# 
#     $ gcc -g3 lineinc.c -o lineinc
#     $ readelf -wml lineinc
#     ...
#      The File Name Table:
#       Entry	Dir	Time	Size	Name
#       1	0	0	0	lineinc.c
#       2	0	0	0	lineinc1.h
#       3	0	0	0	lineinc2.h
#       4	0	0	0	lineinc3.h
#     ...

# Note how the inclusions of lineinc1.h and lineinc2.h are both
# attributed to line 10 of lineinc.c, and the #inclusion of lineinc3.h
# is attributed to line 11.  This is all correct, given the #line
# directives in lineinc.c.
#
# Dwarf 2 macro information doesn't contain enough information to
# allow GDB to figure out what's really going on here --- it makes no
# mention of the #line directives --- so we just try to cope as best
# we can.  If the macro table were to attribute more than one
# #inclusion to the same source line, then GDB wouldn't be able to
# tell which #included file's #definitions and #undefinitions come
# first, so it can't tell which #definitions are in scope following
# all the #inclusions.  To cope with this, GDB puts all the files
# #included by a given source file in a list sorted by the line at
# which they were #included; this gives GDB the chance to detect
# multiple #inclusions at the same line, complain, and assign
# distinct, albiet incorrect, line numbers to each #inclusion.
#
# However, at one point GDB was sorting the list in reverse order,
# while the code to assign new, distinct line numbers assumed it was
# sorted in ascending order; GDB would get an internal error trying to
# read the above debugging info.
