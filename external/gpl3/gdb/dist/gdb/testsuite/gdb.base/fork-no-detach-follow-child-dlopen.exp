# This test is a regression test for when GDB debugs a program with:
# - set follow-fork-mode child
# - set detach-on-fork off
#
# If the program forks, and the child loads a shared library (via
# dlopen for example), GDB should still load the symtab for this objfile.
# When a breakpoint is hit in this file, GDB should display the location
# in the source of the shlib, and "list" should display the source where
# the program stopped.
