  /* Map 6 contiguous pages, and then unmap all second first, and
     second last.

     From GDB we will disassemble each of the _mapped_ pages, with a
     code-cache (dcache) line size bigger than the page size (twice
     bigger).  This makes GDB try to read one page before the mapped
     page once, and the page after another time.  GDB should give no
     error in either case.

     That is, depending on where the kernel aligns the pages, we get
     either:

      .---.---.---.---.---.---.
      | U | M | U | U | M | U |
      '---'---'---'---'---'---.
      |       |       |       |  <- line alignment
       ^^^^^^^         ^^^^^^^
          |               |
          + line1         + line2

     Or:

      .---.---.---.---.---.---.
      | U | M | U | U | M | U |
      '---'---'---'---'---'---.
          |       |       |      <- line alignment
           ^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^
              |       |
        line1 +       + line2

    Note we really want to test that dcache behaves correctly when
    reading a cache line fails.  We're just using unmapped memory as
    proxy for any kind of error.  */
