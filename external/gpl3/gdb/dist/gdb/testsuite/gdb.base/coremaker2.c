/*  This test has two large memory areas buf_rw and buf_ro. 

    buf_rw is written to by the program while buf_ro is initialized at
    compile / load time.  Thus, when a core file is created, buf_rw's
    memory should reside in the core file, but buf_ro probably won't be.
    Instead, the contents of buf_ro are available from the executable.

    Now, for the wrinkle:  We create a one page read-only mapping over
    both of these areas.  This will create a one page "hole" of all
    zeros in each area.

    Will GDB be able to correctly read memory from each of the four
    (or six, if you count the regions on the other side of each hole)
    memory regions?  */
