# This file is a dejagnu "board file" and is used to run the testsuite
# against local host, in remote host mode.
#
# This board file is used to emulate the real remote host testing, in
# which file system of host and build are not shared.  This is achieved
# by copying files from source directory to ${host_dir}.
#
# To use this file:
# bash$ cd ${build_dir}/gdb
# bash$ make check RUNTESTFLAGS="--host_board=local-remote-host-native --target_board=local-remote-host-native HOST_DIR=/tmp/foo/"
#
# We set both target board and host board together to test a native gdb
# (host == target) on a remote host (host != build).  $HOST_DIR is the
# directory for copying files to, to avoid messing up your HOME.  When
# it is absent, files are copied to ./remote-host.

if { $board_type == "target" } {
    set_board_info compiler gcc

# We have to explicitly specify GDB with the path to the copy in
# the build directory because otherwise it will be set to the
# result of "transform GDB" since the harness thinks we're using
# a remote host.  See lib/gdb.exp.
