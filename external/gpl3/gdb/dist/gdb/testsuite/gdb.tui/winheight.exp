# Check what happens when we switch from src layout to split layout.
# The interesting thing here is that the src layout has one flexible
# window (the src), the status window, which is of fixed size, and the
# cmd window, which tries to retain its size when a layout changes.
#
# In contrast, the split layout has both a src and asm window, plus
# the same status and cmd windows.
#
# Of particular interest here is the first test, where we maximise the
# cmd window before switching to split.  This requires gdb to realise
# that it has to shrink the cmd window, even though this is something
# gdb usually avoids doing.
#
# Each test here is a size for the src window in the 'src' layout.
# The test then switches to the 'split' layout, and calculates the
# expected window sizes.
