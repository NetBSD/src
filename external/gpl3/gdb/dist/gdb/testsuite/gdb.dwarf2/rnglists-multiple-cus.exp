# Test to reproduce the crash described in PR 26813.
#
# When reading a list in any table in the .debug_rnglists section, GDB would
# read the header at offset 0 in the section (the header of the first table).
# When the index of the list we read was greater than the number of lists of
# the first table, GDB would erroneously report that the index is invalid.
#
# So this test creates a .debug_rnglists section with two tables.  The second
# table has more lists than the first one and we try to read a high index in
# the second table.
