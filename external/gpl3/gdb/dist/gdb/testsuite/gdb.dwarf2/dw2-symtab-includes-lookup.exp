# Lookup a type in a partial unit with DW_AT_stmt_list.
#
# The test-case is setup such that the partial symtab expansion route is
# .h partial symtab -> shared partial symtab -> toplevel symtab.
#
# That is, the partial symtabs (as displayed by maint print objfiles) are:
#
#   ../sysdeps/x86_64/crtn.S at 0x3d944e0^M
#   elf-init.c at 0x3d94440^M
#   dw2-symtab-includes.h at 0x3d7c7a0^M
#   <unknown> at 0x31ef870^M
#   bla.c at 0x33985f0^M
#   ../sysdeps/x86_64/crti.S at 0x33e9a00^M
#   init.c at 0x33fa600^M
#   ../sysdeps/x86_64/start.S at 0x33f3fd0^M
#
# and the expansion of dw2-symtab-includes.h triggers the expansion of its
# includer <unknown>, which triggers expansion of user bla.c.
#
# The problem in PR28539 was that after expansion of dw2-symtab-includes.h
# the expansion_notify function in psymbol_functions::expand_symtabs_matching
# should be called with the bla.c symtab, but instead it got called with
# nullptr, which caused a segfault.
