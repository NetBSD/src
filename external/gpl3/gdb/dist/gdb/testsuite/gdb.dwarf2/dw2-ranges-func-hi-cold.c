/* The idea here is to, via use of the dwarf assembler, create a function
   which occupies two non-contiguous address ranges.

   foo_cold and foo will be combined into a single function foo with a
   function bar in between these two ranges.

   This test case was motivated by a bug in which a function which
   occupied two non-contiguous address ranges was calling another
   function which resides in between these ranges.  So we end up with
   a situation in which the low/start address of our constructed foo
   (in this case) will be less than any of the addresses in bar, but
   the high/end address of foo will be greater than any of bar's
   addresses.

   This situation was causing a problem in the caching code of
   find_pc_partial_function:  When the low and high addresses of foo
   are placed in the cache, the simple check that was used to see if
   the cache was applicable would (incorrectly) succeed when presented
   with an address in bar.  I.e. an address in bar presented as an
   input to find_pc_partial_function could produce the answer "this
   address belongs to foo".  */
