/* An observer is an entity who is interested in being notified when GDB
   reaches certain states, or certain events occur in GDB.  The entity being
   observed is called the Subject.  To receive notifications, the observer
   attaches a callback to the subject.  One subject can have several
   observers.

   This file implements an internal generic low-level event notification
   mechanism based on the Observer paradigm described in the book "Design
   Patterns".  This generic event notification mechansim is then re-used
   to implement the exported high-level notification management routines
   for all possible notifications.

   The current implementation of the generic observer provides support
   for contextual data.  This contextual data is given to the subject
   when attaching the callback.  In return, the subject will provide
   this contextual data back to the observer as a parameter of the
   callback.

   FIXME: The current support for the contextual data is only partial,
   as it lacks a mechanism that would deallocate this data when the
   callback is detached.  This is not a problem so far, as this contextual
   data is only used internally to hold a function pointer.  Later on,
   if a certain observer needs to provide support for user-level
   contextual data, then the generic notification mechanism will need
   need to be enhanced to allow the observer to provide a routine to
   deallocate the data when attaching the callback.

   This file is currently maintained by hand, but the long term plan
   if the number of different notifications starts growing is to create
   a new script (observer.sh) that would generate this file, and the
   associated documentation.  */
