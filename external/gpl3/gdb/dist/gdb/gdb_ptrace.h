/* The <sys/ptrace.h> header was introduced with 4.4BSD, and provided
   the PT_* symbolic constants for the ptrace(2) request numbers.  The
   ptrace(2) prototype was added later to the same header on BSD.
   SunOS and GNU/Linux have slightly different symbolic names for the
   constants that start with PTRACE_*.  System V still doesn't have
   (and probably never will have) a <sys/ptrace.h> with symbolic
   constants; the ptrace(2) prototype can be found in <unistd.h>.
   Fortunately all systems use the same numerical constants for the
   common ptrace requests.  */
