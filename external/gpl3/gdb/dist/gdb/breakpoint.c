   - Update the list of values that must be watched in B->loc.

   If the watchpoint disposition is disp_del_at_next_stop, then do
   nothing.  If this is local watchpoint that is out of scope, delete
   it.

   Even with `set breakpoint always-inserted on' the watchpoints are
   removed + inserted on each stop here.  Normal breakpoints must
   never be removed because they might be missed by a running thread
   when debugging in non-stop mode.  On the other hand, hardware
   watchpoints (is_hardware_watchpoint; processed here) are specific
   to each LWP since they are stored in each LWP's hardware debug
   registers.  Therefore, such LWP must be stopped first in order to
   be able to modify its hardware watchpoints.

   Hardware watchpoints must be reset exactly once after being
   presented to the user.  It cannot be done sooner, because it would
   reset the data used to present the watchpoint hit to the user.  And
   it must not be done later because it could display the same single
   watchpoint hit during multiple GDB stops.  Note that the latter is
   relevant only to the hardware watchpoint types bp_read_watchpoint
   and bp_access_watchpoint.  False hit by bp_hardware_watchpoint is
   not user-visible - its hit is suppressed if the memory content has
   not changed.

   The following constraints influence the location where we can reset
   hardware watchpoints:

   * target_stopped_by_watchpoint and target_stopped_data_address are
     called several times when GDB stops.

   [linux] 
   * Multiple hardware watchpoints can be hit at the same time,
     causing GDB to stop.  GDB only presents one hardware watchpoint
     hit at a time as the reason for stopping, and all the other hits
     are presented later, one after the other, each time the user
     requests the execution to be resumed.  Execution is not resumed
     for the threads still having pending hit event stored in
     LWP_INFO->STATUS.  While the watchpoint is already removed from
     the inferior on the first stop the thread hit event is kept being
     reported from its cached value by linux_nat_stopped_data_address
     until the real thread resume happens after the watchpoint gets
     presented and thus its LWP_INFO->STATUS gets reset.

   Therefore the hardware watchpoint hit can get safely reset on the
   watchpoint removal from inferior.  */

       carries them to the call-site of the current callee, by setting

       In the absence of a general solution for the "how do we know
       it's safe to delete something others may have handles to?"
       problem, what we'll do here is just uninsert the bp_finish, and

		     2. We're watching the triggered memory for both

		     2.1. This is a target that can't break on data
		     reads only, but can break on accesses (reads or
		     writes), such as e.g., x86.  We detect this case
		     at the time we try to insert read watchpoints.

		     2.2. Otherwise, the target supports read
		     watchpoints, but, the user set an access or write
		     watchpoint watching the same memory as this read
		     watchpoint.

		     If we're watching memory writes as well as reads,
		     ignore watchpoint hits when we find that the
		     value hasn't changed, as reads don't cause
		     changes.  This still gives false positives when
		     the program writes the same value to memory as

     Watchpoints of the first kind are never auto-deleted, and even

     from shared libraries, we need to reparse expression as libraries
     are loaded and unloaded.

     Watchpoints on local variables can also change meaning as result
     of solib event.  For example, if a watchpoint uses both a local
     and a global variables in expression, it's a local watchpoint,
     but unloading of a shared library will make the expression
     invalid.  This is not a very common use case, but we still
     re-evaluate expression, to avoid surprises to the user.

     Note that for local watchpoints, we re-evaluate it only if
     watchpoints frame id is still valid.  If it's not, it means the
     watchpoint is out of scope and will be deleted soon.  In fact,
     I'm not sure we'll ever be called in this case.

     If a local watchpoint's frame id is still valid, then

     behind to decide whether we can detect any possible change to the

		 We apply an heuristic to be able to distinguish such
		 SIGTRAPs from other random SIGTRAPs: we keep this
		 breakpoint location for a bit, and will retire it
		 after we see some number of events.  The theory here
		 is that reporting of events should, "on the average",
		 be fair, so after a while we'll see events from all
		 threads that have anything of interest, and no longer
		 need to keep this breakpoint location around.  We
		 don't hold locations forever so to reduce chances of
		 mistaking a non-breakpoint SIGTRAP for a breakpoint
		 SIGTRAP.

		 The heuristic failing can be disastrous on
		 decr_pc_after_break targets.

		 On decr_pc_after_break targets, like e.g., x86-linux,
		 if we fail to recognize a late breakpoint SIGTRAP,
		 because events_till_retirement has reached 0 too
		 soon, we'll fail to do the PC adjustment, and report
		 a random SIGTRAP to the user.  When the user resumes
		 the inferior, it will most likely immediately crash
		 with SIGILL/SIGBUS/SIGSEGV, or worse, get silently
		 corrupted, because of being resumed e.g., in the
		 middle of a multi-byte instruction, or skipped a
		 one-byte instruction.  This was actually seen happen
		 on native x86-linux, and should be less rare on
		 targets that do not support new thread events, like
		 remote, due to the heuristic depending on
		 thread_count.

		 Mistaking a random SIGTRAP for a breakpoint trap
		 causes similar symptoms (PC adjustment applied when
		 it shouldn't), but then again, playing with SIGTRAPs
		 behind the debugger's back is asking for trouble.

		 Since hardware watchpoint traps are always
		 distinguishable from other traps, so we don't need to
		 apply keep hardware watchpoint moribund locations
		 around.  We simply always ignore hardware watchpoint
		 traps we can no longer explain.  */

/* When symbols change, it probably means the sources changed as well,
   and it might mean the static tracepoint markers are no longer at
   the same address or line numbers they used to be at last we
   checked.  Losing your static tracepoints whenever you rebuild is
   undesirable.  This function tries to resync/rematch gdb static
   tracepoints with the markers on the target, for static tracepoints
   that have not been set by marker id.  Static tracepoint that have
   been set by marker id are reset by marker id in breakpoint_re_set.
   The heuristic is:

   1) For a tracepoint set at a specific address, look for a marker at
   the old PC.  If one is found there, assume to be the same marker.
   If the name / string id of the marker found is different from the
   previous known name, assume that means the user renamed the marker
   in the sources, and output a warning.

   2) For a tracepoint set at a given line number, look for a marker
   at the new address of the old line number.  If one is found there,
   assume to be the same marker.  If the name / string id of the
   marker found is different from the previous known name, assume that
   means the user renamed the marker in the sources, and output a
   warning.

   3) If a marker is no longer found at the same address or line, it
   may mean the marker no longer exists.  But it may also just mean
   the code changed a bit.  Maybe the user added a few lines of code
   that made the marker move up or down (in line number terms).  Ask
   the target for info about the marker with the string id as we knew
   it.  If found, update line number and address in the matching
   static tracepoint.  This will get confused if there's more than one
   marker with the same ID (possible in UST, although unadvised
   precisely because it confuses tools).  */
