/* Return the full pathname of a binary file (the main executable or a
   shared library file), or NULL if not found.  If FD is non-NULL, *FD
   is set to either -1 or an open file handle for the binary file.

   Global variable GDB_SYSROOT is used as a prefix directory
   to search for binary files if they have an absolute path.
   If GDB_SYSROOT starts with "target:" and target filesystem
   is the local filesystem then the "target:" prefix will be
   stripped before the search starts.  This ensures that the
   same search algorithm is used for local files regardless of
   whether a "target:" prefix was used.

   Global variable SOLIB_SEARCH_PATH is used as a prefix directory
   (or set of directories, as in LD_LIBRARY_PATH) to search for all
   shared libraries if not found in either the sysroot (if set) or
   the local filesystem.  SOLIB_SEARCH_PATH is not used when searching
   for the main executable.

   Search algorithm:
   * If a sysroot is set and path is absolute:
   *   Search for sysroot/path.
   * else
   *   Look for it literally (unmodified).
   * If IS_SOLIB is non-zero:
   *   Look in SOLIB_SEARCH_PATH.
   *   If available, use target defined search function.
   * If NO sysroot is set, perform the following two searches:
   *   Look in inferior's $PATH.
   *   If IS_SOLIB is non-zero:
   *     Look in inferior's $LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
   *
   * The last check avoids doing this search when targeting remote
   * machines since a sysroot will almost always be set.
