/* This structure describes the strings necessary to give small command
   sequences to the monitor, and parse the response.

   CMD is the actual command typed at the monitor.  Usually this has
   embedded sequences ala printf, which are substituted with the
   arguments appropriate to that type of command.  Ie: to examine a
   register, we substitute the register name for the first arg.  To
   modify memory, we substitute the memory location and the new
   contents for the first and second args, etc...

   RESP_DELIM used to home in on the response string, and is used to
   disambiguate the answer within the pile of text returned by the
   monitor.  This should be a unique string that immediately precedes
   the answer.  Ie: if your monitor prints out `PC: 00000001= ' in
   response to asking for the PC, you should use `: ' as the
   RESP_DELIM.  RESP_DELIM may be NULL if the res- ponse is going to
   be ignored, or has no particular leading text.

   TERM is the string that the monitor outputs to indicate that it is
   idle, and waiting for input.  This is usually a prompt of some
   sort.  In the previous example, it would be `= '.  It is important
   that TERM really means that the monitor is idle, otherwise GDB may
   try to type at it when it isn't ready for input.  This is a problem
   because many monitors cannot deal with type-ahead.  TERM may be
   NULL if the normal prompt is output.

   TERM_CMD is used to quit out of the subcommand mode and get back to
   the main prompt.  TERM_CMD may be NULL if it isn't necessary.  It
   will also be ignored if TERM is NULL.  */
