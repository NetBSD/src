/* UNDEF_DOMAIN is used when a domain has not been discovered or
   none of the following apply.  This usually indicates an error either
   in the symbol information or in gdb's handling of symbols.  */

SYM_DOMAIN (UNDEF)

/* VAR_DOMAIN is the usual domain.  In C, this contains variables,
   function names, typedef names and enum type values.  */

SYM_DOMAIN (VAR)

/* STRUCT_DOMAIN is used in C to hold struct, union and enum type names.
   Thus, if `struct foo' is used in a C program, it produces a symbol named
   `foo' in the STRUCT_DOMAIN.  */

SYM_DOMAIN (STRUCT)

/* MODULE_DOMAIN is used in Fortran to hold module type names.  */

SYM_DOMAIN (MODULE)

/* LABEL_DOMAIN may be used for names of labels (for gotos).  */

SYM_DOMAIN (LABEL)

/* Fortran common blocks.  Their naming must be separate from VAR_DOMAIN.
   They also always use LOC_COMMON_BLOCK.  */
SYM_DOMAIN (COMMON_BLOCK)

/* TYPE_DOMAIN is for types and typedefs.  Note that tags are not
   found here, see STRUCT_DOMAIN above.  If a language does not have a
   tag namespace, then all types (including structures, etc) are
   here.  */

SYM_DOMAIN (TYPE)

/* FUNCTION_DOMAIN is for functions and methods.  */

SYM_DOMAIN (FUNCTION)
