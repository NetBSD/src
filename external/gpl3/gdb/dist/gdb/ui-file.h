   This exists because there is no real line-buffering on Windows, see
   <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/86cebhfs%28v=vs.71%29.aspx>
   so the stdout is either fully-buffered or non-buffered.  We can't
   make stdout non-buffered, because of two concerns:

    1. Non-buffering hurts performance.
    2. Non-buffering may change GDB's behavior when it is interacting
       with a front-end, such as Emacs.

   We leave stdout as fully buffered, but flush it first when
   something is written to stderr.

   Note that the 'write_async_safe' method is not overridden, because
   there's no way to flush a stream in an async-safe manner.
   Fortunately, it doesn't really matter, because:

    1. That method is only used for printing internal debug output
       from signal handlers.

    2. Windows hosts don't have a concept of async-safeness.  Signal
       handlers run in a separate thread, so they can call the regular
       non-async-safe output routines freely.
