23.2.2.12 Inferiors In Python
.............................

Programs which are being run under GDB are called inferiors (*note
Inferiors and Programs::).  Python scripts can access information about
and manipulate inferiors controlled by GDB via objects of the
'gdb.Inferior' class.

   The following inferior-related functions are available in the 'gdb'
module:

 -- Function: gdb.inferiors ()
     Return a tuple containing all inferior objects.

 -- Function: gdb.selected_inferior ()
     Return an object representing the current inferior.

   A 'gdb.Inferior' object has the following attributes:

 -- Variable: Inferior.num
     ID of inferior, as assigned by GDB.

 -- Variable: Inferior.pid
     Process ID of the inferior, as assigned by the underlying operating
     system.

 -- Variable: Inferior.was_attached
     Boolean signaling whether the inferior was created using 'attach',
     or started by GDB itself.

   A 'gdb.Inferior' object has the following methods:

 -- Function: Inferior.is_valid ()
     Returns 'True' if the 'gdb.Inferior' object is valid, 'False' if
     not.  A 'gdb.Inferior' object will become invalid if the inferior
     no longer exists within GDB.  All other 'gdb.Inferior' methods will
     throw an exception if it is invalid at the time the method is
     called.

 -- Function: Inferior.threads ()
     This method returns a tuple holding all the threads which are valid
     when it is called.  If there are no valid threads, the method will
     return an empty tuple.

 -- Function: Inferior.read_memory (address, length)
     Read LENGTH bytes of memory from the inferior, starting at ADDRESS.
     Returns a buffer object, which behaves much like an array or a
     string.  It can be modified and given to the
     'Inferior.write_memory' function.  In 'Python' 3, the return value
     is a 'memoryview' object.

 -- Function: Inferior.write_memory (address, buffer [, length])
     Write the contents of BUFFER to the inferior, starting at ADDRESS.
     The BUFFER parameter must be a Python object which supports the
     buffer protocol, i.e., a string, an array or the object returned
     from 'Inferior.read_memory'.  If given, LENGTH determines the
     number of bytes from BUFFER to be written.

 -- Function: Inferior.search_memory (address, length, pattern)
     Search a region of the inferior memory starting at ADDRESS with the
     given LENGTH using the search pattern supplied in PATTERN.  The
     PATTERN parameter must be a Python object which supports the buffer
     protocol, i.e., a string, an array or the object returned from
     'gdb.read_memory'.  Returns a Python 'Long' containing the address
     where the pattern was found, or 'None' if the pattern could not be
     found.

23.2.2.13 Events In Python
..........................

GDB provides a general event facility so that Python code can be
notified of various state changes, particularly changes that occur in
the inferior.

   An "event" is just an object that describes some state change.  The
type of the object and its attributes will vary depending on the details
of the change.  All the existing events are described below.

   In order to be notified of an event, you must register an event
handler with an "event registry".  An event registry is an object in the
'gdb.events' module which dispatches particular events.  A registry
provides methods to register and unregister event handlers:

 -- Function: EventRegistry.connect (object)
     Add the given callable OBJECT to the registry.  This object will be
     called when an event corresponding to this registry occurs.

 -- Function: EventRegistry.disconnect (object)
     Remove the given OBJECT from the registry.  Once removed, the
     object will no longer receive notifications of events.

   Here is an example:

     def exit_handler (event):
         print "event type: exit"
         print "exit code: %d" % (event.exit_code)

     gdb.events.exited.connect (exit_handler)

   In the above example we connect our handler 'exit_handler' to the
registry 'events.exited'.  Once connected, 'exit_handler' gets called
when the inferior exits.  The argument "event" in this example is of
type 'gdb.ExitedEvent'.  As you can see in the example the 'ExitedEvent'
object has an attribute which indicates the exit code of the inferior.

   The following is a listing of the event registries that are available
and details of the events they emit:

'events.cont'
     Emits 'gdb.ThreadEvent'.

     Some events can be thread specific when GDB is running in non-stop
     mode.  When represented in Python, these events all extend
     'gdb.ThreadEvent'.  Note, this event is not emitted directly;
     instead, events which are emitted by this or other modules might
     extend this event.  Examples of these events are
     'gdb.BreakpointEvent' and 'gdb.ContinueEvent'.

      -- Variable: ThreadEvent.inferior_thread
          In non-stop mode this attribute will be set to the specific
          thread which was involved in the emitted event.  Otherwise, it
          will be set to 'None'.

     Emits 'gdb.ContinueEvent' which extends 'gdb.ThreadEvent'.

     This event indicates that the inferior has been continued after a
     stop.  For inherited attribute refer to 'gdb.ThreadEvent' above.

'events.exited'
     Emits 'events.ExitedEvent' which indicates that the inferior has
     exited.  'events.ExitedEvent' has two attributes:
      -- Variable: ExitedEvent.exit_code
          An integer representing the exit code, if available, which the
          inferior has returned.  (The exit code could be unavailable
          if, for example, GDB detaches from the inferior.)  If the exit
          code is unavailable, the attribute does not exist.
      -- Variable: ExitedEvent inferior
          A reference to the inferior which triggered the 'exited'
          event.

'events.stop'
     Emits 'gdb.StopEvent' which extends 'gdb.ThreadEvent'.

     Indicates that the inferior has stopped.  All events emitted by
     this registry extend StopEvent.  As a child of 'gdb.ThreadEvent',
     'gdb.StopEvent' will indicate the stopped thread when GDB is
     running in non-stop mode.  Refer to 'gdb.ThreadEvent' above for
     more details.

     Emits 'gdb.SignalEvent' which extends 'gdb.StopEvent'.

     This event indicates that the inferior or one of its threads has
     received as signal.  'gdb.SignalEvent' has the following
     attributes:

      -- Variable: SignalEvent.stop_signal
          A string representing the signal received by the inferior.  A
          list of possible signal values can be obtained by running the
          command 'info signals' in the GDB command prompt.

     Also emits 'gdb.BreakpointEvent' which extends 'gdb.StopEvent'.

     'gdb.BreakpointEvent' event indicates that one or more breakpoints
     have been hit, and has the following attributes:

      -- Variable: BreakpointEvent.breakpoints
          A sequence containing references to all the breakpoints (type
          'gdb.Breakpoint') that were hit.  *Note Breakpoints In
          Python::, for details of the 'gdb.Breakpoint' object.
      -- Variable: BreakpointEvent.breakpoint
          A reference to the first breakpoint that was hit.  This
          function is maintained for backward compatibility and is now
          deprecated in favor of the 'gdb.BreakpointEvent.breakpoints'
          attribute.

'events.new_objfile'
     Emits 'gdb.NewObjFileEvent' which indicates that a new object file
     has been loaded by GDB.  'gdb.NewObjFileEvent' has one attribute:

      -- Variable: NewObjFileEvent.new_objfile
          A reference to the object file ('gdb.Objfile') which has been
          loaded.  *Note Objfiles In Python::, for details of the
          'gdb.Objfile' object.

23.2.2.14 Threads In Python
...........................

Python scripts can access information about, and manipulate inferior
threads controlled by GDB, via objects of the 'gdb.InferiorThread'
class.

   The following thread-related functions are available in the 'gdb'
module:

 -- Function: gdb.selected_thread ()
     This function returns the thread object for the selected thread.
     If there is no selected thread, this will return 'None'.

   A 'gdb.InferiorThread' object has the following attributes:

 -- Variable: InferiorThread.name
     The name of the thread.  If the user specified a name using 'thread
     name', then this returns that name.  Otherwise, if an OS-supplied
     name is available, then it is returned.  Otherwise, this returns
     'None'.

     This attribute can be assigned to.  The new value must be a string
     object, which sets the new name, or 'None', which removes any
     user-specified thread name.

 -- Variable: InferiorThread.num
     ID of the thread, as assigned by GDB.

 -- Variable: InferiorThread.ptid
     ID of the thread, as assigned by the operating system.  This
     attribute is a tuple containing three integers.  The first is the
     Process ID (PID); the second is the Lightweight Process ID (LWPID),
     and the third is the Thread ID (TID). Either the LWPID or TID may
     be 0, which indicates that the operating system does not use that
     identifier.

   A 'gdb.InferiorThread' object has the following methods:

 -- Function: InferiorThread.is_valid ()
     Returns 'True' if the 'gdb.InferiorThread' object is valid, 'False'
     if not.  A 'gdb.InferiorThread' object will become invalid if the
     thread exits, or the inferior that the thread belongs is deleted.
     All other 'gdb.InferiorThread' methods will throw an exception if
     it is invalid at the time the method is called.

 -- Function: InferiorThread.switch ()
     This changes GDB's currently selected thread to the one represented
     by this object.

 -- Function: InferiorThread.is_stopped ()
     Return a Boolean indicating whether the thread is stopped.

 -- Function: InferiorThread.is_running ()
     Return a Boolean indicating whether the thread is running.

 -- Function: InferiorThread.is_exited ()
     Return a Boolean indicating whether the thread is exited.

23.2.2.15 Commands In Python
............................

You can implement new GDB CLI commands in Python.  A CLI command is
implemented using an instance of the 'gdb.Command' class, most commonly
using a subclass.

 -- Function: Command.__init__ (name, COMMAND_CLASS [, COMPLETER_CLASS
          [, PREFIX]])
     The object initializer for 'Command' registers the new command with
     GDB.  This initializer is normally invoked from the subclass' own
     '__init__' method.

     NAME is the name of the command.  If NAME consists of multiple
     words, then the initial words are looked for as prefix commands.
     In this case, if one of the prefix commands does not exist, an
     exception is raised.

     There is no support for multi-line commands.

     COMMAND_CLASS should be one of the 'COMMAND_' constants defined
     below.  This argument tells GDB how to categorize the new command
     in the help system.

     COMPLETER_CLASS is an optional argument.  If given, it should be
     one of the 'COMPLETE_' constants defined below.  This argument
     tells GDB how to perform completion for this command.  If not
     given, GDB will attempt to complete using the object's 'complete'
     method (see below); if no such method is found, an error will occur
     when completion is attempted.

     PREFIX is an optional argument.  If 'True', then the new command is
     a prefix command; sub-commands of this command may be registered.

     The help text for the new command is taken from the Python
     documentation string for the command's class, if there is one.  If
     no documentation string is provided, the default value "This
     command is not documented."  is used.

 -- Function: Command.dont_repeat ()
     By default, a GDB command is repeated when the user enters a blank
     line at the command prompt.  A command can suppress this behavior
     by invoking the 'dont_repeat' method.  This is similar to the user
     command 'dont-repeat', see *note dont-repeat: Define.

 -- Function: Command.invoke (argument, from_tty)
     This method is called by GDB when this command is invoked.

     ARGUMENT is a string.  It is the argument to the command, after
     leading and trailing whitespace has been stripped.

     FROM_TTY is a boolean argument.  When true, this means that the
     command was entered by the user at the terminal; when false it
     means that the command came from elsewhere.

     If this method throws an exception, it is turned into a GDB 'error'
     call.  Otherwise, the return value is ignored.

     To break ARGUMENT up into an argv-like string use
     'gdb.string_to_argv'.  This function behaves identically to GDB's
     internal argument lexer 'buildargv'.  It is recommended to use this
     for consistency.  Arguments are separated by spaces and may be
     quoted.  Example:

          print gdb.string_to_argv ("1 2\ \\\"3 '4 \"5' \"6 '7\"")
          ['1', '2 "3', '4 "5', "6 '7"]

 -- Function: Command.complete (text, word)
     This method is called by GDB when the user attempts completion on
     this command.  All forms of completion are handled by this method,
     that is, the <TAB> and <M-?> key bindings (*note Completion::), and
     the 'complete' command (*note complete: Help.).

     The arguments TEXT and WORD are both strings.  TEXT holds the
     complete command line up to the cursor's location.  WORD holds the
     last word of the command line; this is computed using a
     word-breaking heuristic.

     The 'complete' method can return several values:
        * If the return value is a sequence, the contents of the
          sequence are used as the completions.  It is up to 'complete'
          to ensure that the contents actually do complete the word.  A
          zero-length sequence is allowed, it means that there were no
          completions available.  Only string elements of the sequence
          are used; other elements in the sequence are ignored.

        * If the return value is one of the 'COMPLETE_' constants
          defined below, then the corresponding GDB-internal completion
          function is invoked, and its result is used.

        * All other results are treated as though there were no
          available completions.

   When a new command is registered, it must be declared as a member of
some general class of commands.  This is used to classify top-level
commands in the on-line help system; note that prefix commands are not
listed under their own category but rather that of their top-level
command.  The available classifications are represented by constants
defined in the 'gdb' module:

'gdb.COMMAND_NONE'
     The command does not belong to any particular class.  A command in
     this category will not be displayed in any of the help categories.

'gdb.COMMAND_RUNNING'
     The command is related to running the inferior.  For example,
     'start', 'step', and 'continue' are in this category.  Type 'help
     running' at the GDB prompt to see a list of commands in this
     category.

'gdb.COMMAND_DATA'
     The command is related to data or variables.  For example, 'call',
     'find', and 'print' are in this category.  Type 'help data' at the
     GDB prompt to see a list of commands in this category.

'gdb.COMMAND_STACK'
     The command has to do with manipulation of the stack.  For example,
     'backtrace', 'frame', and 'return' are in this category.  Type
     'help stack' at the GDB prompt to see a list of commands in this
     category.

'gdb.COMMAND_FILES'
     This class is used for file-related commands.  For example, 'file',
     'list' and 'section' are in this category.  Type 'help files' at
     the GDB prompt to see a list of commands in this category.

'gdb.COMMAND_SUPPORT'
     This should be used for "support facilities", generally meaning
     things that are useful to the user when interacting with GDB, but
     not related to the state of the inferior.  For example, 'help',
     'make', and 'shell' are in this category.  Type 'help support' at
     the GDB prompt to see a list of commands in this category.

'gdb.COMMAND_STATUS'
     The command is an 'info'-related command, that is, related to the
     state of GDB itself.  For example, 'info', 'macro', and 'show' are
     in this category.  Type 'help status' at the GDB prompt to see a
     list of commands in this category.

'gdb.COMMAND_BREAKPOINTS'
     The command has to do with breakpoints.  For example, 'break',
     'clear', and 'delete' are in this category.  Type 'help
     breakpoints' at the GDB prompt to see a list of commands in this
     category.

'gdb.COMMAND_TRACEPOINTS'
     The command has to do with tracepoints.  For example, 'trace',
     'actions', and 'tfind' are in this category.  Type 'help
     tracepoints' at the GDB prompt to see a list of commands in this
     category.

'gdb.COMMAND_USER'
     The command is a general purpose command for the user, and
     typically does not fit in one of the other categories.  Type 'help
     user-defined' at the GDB prompt to see a list of commands in this
     category, as well as the list of gdb macros (*note Sequences::).

'gdb.COMMAND_OBSCURE'
     The command is only used in unusual circumstances, or is not of
     general interest to users.  For example, 'checkpoint', 'fork', and
     'stop' are in this category.  Type 'help obscure' at the GDB prompt
     to see a list of commands in this category.

'gdb.COMMAND_MAINTENANCE'
     The command is only useful to GDB maintainers.  The 'maintenance'
     and 'flushregs' commands are in this category.  Type 'help
     internals' at the GDB prompt to see a list of commands in this
     category.

   A new command can use a predefined completion function, either by
specifying it via an argument at initialization, or by returning it from
the 'complete' method.  These predefined completion constants are all
defined in the 'gdb' module:

'gdb.COMPLETE_NONE'
     This constant means that no completion should be done.

'gdb.COMPLETE_FILENAME'
     This constant means that filename completion should be performed.

'gdb.COMPLETE_LOCATION'
     This constant means that location completion should be done.  *Note
     Specify Location::.

'gdb.COMPLETE_COMMAND'
     This constant means that completion should examine GDB command
     names.

'gdb.COMPLETE_SYMBOL'
     This constant means that completion should be done using symbol
     names as the source.

'gdb.COMPLETE_EXPRESSION'
     This constant means that completion should be done on expressions.
     Often this means completing on symbol names, but some language
     parsers also have support for completing on field names.

   The following code snippet shows how a trivial CLI command can be
implemented in Python:

     class HelloWorld (gdb.Command):
       """Greet the whole world."""

       def __init__ (self):
         super (HelloWorld, self).__init__ ("hello-world", gdb.COMMAND_USER)

       def invoke (self, arg, from_tty):
         print "Hello, World!"

     HelloWorld ()

   The last line instantiates the class, and is necessary to trigger the
registration of the command with GDB.  Depending on how the Python code
is read into GDB, you may need to import the 'gdb' module explicitly.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Parameters In Python,  Next: Functions In Python,  Prev: Commands In Python,  Up: Python API

23.2.2.16 Parameters In Python
..............................

You can implement new GDB parameters using Python.  A new parameter is
implemented as an instance of the 'gdb.Parameter' class.

   Parameters are exposed to the user via the 'set' and 'show' commands.
*Note Help::.

   There are many parameters that already exist and can be set in GDB.
Two examples are: 'set follow fork' and 'set charset'.  Setting these
parameters influences certain behavior in GDB.  Similarly, you can
define parameters that can be used to influence behavior in custom
Python scripts and commands.

 -- Function: Parameter.__init__ (name, COMMAND-CLASS, PARAMETER-CLASS
          [, ENUM-SEQUENCE])
     The object initializer for 'Parameter' registers the new parameter
     with GDB.  This initializer is normally invoked from the subclass'
     own '__init__' method.

     NAME is the name of the new parameter.  If NAME consists of
     multiple words, then the initial words are looked for as prefix
     parameters.  An example of this can be illustrated with the 'set
     print' set of parameters.  If NAME is 'print foo', then 'print'
     will be searched as the prefix parameter.  In this case the
     parameter can subsequently be accessed in GDB as 'set print foo'.

     If NAME consists of multiple words, and no prefix parameter group
     can be found, an exception is raised.

     COMMAND-CLASS should be one of the 'COMMAND_' constants (*note
     Commands In Python::).  This argument tells GDB how to categorize
     the new parameter in the help system.

     PARAMETER-CLASS should be one of the 'PARAM_' constants defined
     below.  This argument tells GDB the type of the new parameter; this
     information is used for input validation and completion.

     If PARAMETER-CLASS is 'PARAM_ENUM', then ENUM-SEQUENCE must be a
     sequence of strings.  These strings represent the possible values
     for the parameter.

     If PARAMETER-CLASS is not 'PARAM_ENUM', then the presence of a
     fourth argument will cause an exception to be thrown.

     The help text for the new parameter is taken from the Python
     documentation string for the parameter's class, if there is one.
     If there is no documentation string, a default value is used.

 -- Variable: Parameter.set_doc
     If this attribute exists, and is a string, then its value is used
     as the help text for this parameter's 'set' command.  The value is
     examined when 'Parameter.__init__' is invoked; subsequent changes
     have no effect.

 -- Variable: Parameter.show_doc
     If this attribute exists, and is a string, then its value is used
     as the help text for this parameter's 'show' command.  The value is
     examined when 'Parameter.__init__' is invoked; subsequent changes
     have no effect.

 -- Variable: Parameter.value
     The 'value' attribute holds the underlying value of the parameter.
     It can be read and assigned to just as any other attribute.  GDB
     does validation when assignments are made.

   There are two methods that should be implemented in any 'Parameter'
class.  These are:

 -- Function: Parameter.get_set_string (self)
     GDB will call this method when a PARAMETER's value has been changed
     via the 'set' API (for example, 'set foo off').  The 'value'
     attribute has already been populated with the new value and may be
     used in output.  This method must return a string.

 -- Function: Parameter.get_show_string (self, svalue)
     GDB will call this method when a PARAMETER's 'show' API has been
     invoked (for example, 'show foo').  The argument 'svalue' receives
     the string representation of the current value.  This method must
     return a string.

   When a new parameter is defined, its type must be specified.  The
available types are represented by constants defined in the 'gdb'
module:

'gdb.PARAM_BOOLEAN'
     The value is a plain boolean.  The Python boolean values, 'True'
     and 'False' are the only valid values.

'gdb.PARAM_AUTO_BOOLEAN'
     The value has three possible states: true, false, and 'auto'.  In
     Python, true and false are represented using boolean constants, and
     'auto' is represented using 'None'.

'gdb.PARAM_UINTEGER'
     The value is an unsigned integer.  The value of 0 should be
     interpreted to mean "unlimited".

'gdb.PARAM_INTEGER'
     The value is a signed integer.  The value of 0 should be
     interpreted to mean "unlimited".

'gdb.PARAM_STRING'
     The value is a string.  When the user modifies the string, any
     escape sequences, such as '\t', '\f', and octal escapes, are
     translated into corresponding characters and encoded into the
     current host charset.

'gdb.PARAM_STRING_NOESCAPE'
     The value is a string.  When the user modifies the string, escapes
     are passed through untranslated.

'gdb.PARAM_OPTIONAL_FILENAME'
     The value is a either a filename (a string), or 'None'.

'gdb.PARAM_FILENAME'
     The value is a filename.  This is just like
     'PARAM_STRING_NOESCAPE', but uses file names for completion.

'gdb.PARAM_ZINTEGER'
     The value is an integer.  This is like 'PARAM_INTEGER', except 0 is
     interpreted as itself.

'gdb.PARAM_ENUM'
     The value is a string, which must be one of a collection string
     constants provided when the parameter is created.

You can implement new convenience functions (*note Convenience Vars::)
in Python.  A convenience function is an instance of a subclass of the
class 'gdb.Function'.

 -- Function: Function.__init__ (name)
     The initializer for 'Function' registers the new function with GDB.
     The argument NAME is the name of the function, a string.  The
     function will be visible to the user as a convenience variable of
     type 'internal function', whose name is the same as the given NAME.

     The documentation for the new function is taken from the
     documentation string for the new class.

 -- Function: Function.invoke (*ARGS)
     When a convenience function is evaluated, its arguments are
     converted to instances of 'gdb.Value', and then the function's
     'invoke' method is called.  Note that GDB does not predetermine the
     arity of convenience functions.  Instead, all available arguments
     are passed to 'invoke', following the standard Python calling
     convention.  In particular, a convenience function can have default
     values for parameters without ill effect.

     The return value of this method is used as its value in the
     enclosing expression.  If an ordinary Python value is returned, it
     is converted to a 'gdb.Value' following the usual rules.

   The following code snippet shows how a trivial convenience function
can be implemented in Python:

     class Greet (gdb.Function):
       """Return string to greet someone.
     Takes a name as argument."""

       def __init__ (self):
         super (Greet, self).__init__ ("greet")

       def invoke (self, name):
         return "Hello, %s!" % name.string ()

     Greet ()

   The last line instantiates the class, and is necessary to trigger the
registration of the function with GDB.  Depending on how the Python code
is read into GDB, you may need to import the 'gdb' module explicitly.

   Now you can use the function in an expression:

     (gdb) print $greet("Bob")
     $1 = "Hello, Bob!"

23.2.2.18 Program Spaces In Python
..................................

A program space, or "progspace", represents a symbolic view of an
address space.  It consists of all of the objfiles of the program.
*Note Objfiles In Python::.  *Note program spaces: Inferiors and
Programs, for more details about program spaces.

   The following progspace-related functions are available in the 'gdb'
module:

 -- Function: gdb.current_progspace ()
     This function returns the program space of the currently selected
     inferior.  *Note Inferiors and Programs::.

 -- Function: gdb.progspaces ()
     Return a sequence of all the progspaces currently known to GDB.

   Each progspace is represented by an instance of the 'gdb.Progspace'
class.

 -- Variable: Progspace.filename
     The file name of the progspace as a string.

 -- Variable: Progspace.pretty_printers
     The 'pretty_printers' attribute is a list of functions.  It is used
     to look up pretty-printers.  A 'Value' is passed to each function
     in order; if the function returns 'None', then the search
     continues.  Otherwise, the return value should be an object which
     is used to format the value.  *Note Pretty Printing API::, for more
     information.

 -- Variable: Progspace.type_printers
     The 'type_printers' attribute is a list of type printer objects.
     *Note Type Printing API::, for more information.

 -- Variable: Progspace.frame_filters
     The 'frame_filters' attribute is a dictionary of frame filter
     objects.  *Note Frame Filter API::, for more information.

23.2.2.19 Objfiles In Python
............................

GDB loads symbols for an inferior from various symbol-containing files
(*note Files::).  These include the primary executable file, any shared
libraries used by the inferior, and any separate debug info files (*note
Separate Debug Files::).  GDB calls these symbol-containing files
"objfiles".

   The following objfile-related functions are available in the 'gdb'
module:

 -- Function: gdb.current_objfile ()
     When auto-loading a Python script (*note Python Auto-loading::),
     GDB sets the "current objfile" to the corresponding objfile.  This
     function returns the current objfile.  If there is no current
     objfile, this function returns 'None'.

 -- Function: gdb.objfiles ()
     Return a sequence of all the objfiles current known to GDB.  *Note
     Objfiles In Python::.

   Each objfile is represented by an instance of the 'gdb.Objfile'
class.

 -- Variable: Objfile.filename
     The file name of the objfile as a string.

 -- Variable: Objfile.pretty_printers
     The 'pretty_printers' attribute is a list of functions.  It is used
     to look up pretty-printers.  A 'Value' is passed to each function
     in order; if the function returns 'None', then the search
     continues.  Otherwise, the return value should be an object which
     is used to format the value.  *Note Pretty Printing API::, for more
     information.

 -- Variable: Objfile.type_printers
     The 'type_printers' attribute is a list of type printer objects.
     *Note Type Printing API::, for more information.

 -- Variable: Objfile.frame_filters
     The 'frame_filters' attribute is a dictionary of frame filter
     objects.  *Note Frame Filter API::, for more information.

   A 'gdb.Objfile' object has the following methods:

 -- Function: Objfile.is_valid ()
     Returns 'True' if the 'gdb.Objfile' object is valid, 'False' if
     not.  A 'gdb.Objfile' object can become invalid if the object file
     it refers to is not loaded in GDB any longer.  All other
     'gdb.Objfile' methods will throw an exception if it is invalid at
     the time the method is called.

23.2.2.20 Accessing inferior stack frames from Python.
......................................................

When the debugged program stops, GDB is able to analyze its call stack
(*note Stack frames: Frames.).  The 'gdb.Frame' class represents a frame
in the stack.  A 'gdb.Frame' object is only valid while its
corresponding frame exists in the inferior's stack.  If you try to use
an invalid frame object, GDB will throw a 'gdb.error' exception (*note
Exception Handling::).

   Two 'gdb.Frame' objects can be compared for equality with the '=='
operator, like:

     (gdb) python print gdb.newest_frame() == gdb.selected_frame ()
     True

   The following frame-related functions are available in the 'gdb'
module:

 -- Function: gdb.selected_frame ()
     Return the selected frame object.  (*note Selecting a Frame:
     Selection.).

 -- Function: gdb.newest_frame ()
     Return the newest frame object for the selected thread.

 -- Function: gdb.frame_stop_reason_string (reason)
     Return a string explaining the reason why GDB stopped unwinding
     frames, as expressed by the given REASON code (an integer, see the
     'unwind_stop_reason' method further down in this section).

   A 'gdb.Frame' object has the following methods:

 -- Function: Frame.is_valid ()
     Returns true if the 'gdb.Frame' object is valid, false if not.  A
     frame object can become invalid if the frame it refers to doesn't
     exist anymore in the inferior.  All 'gdb.Frame' methods will throw
     an exception if it is invalid at the time the method is called.

 -- Function: Frame.name ()
     Returns the function name of the frame, or 'None' if it can't be
     obtained.

 -- Function: Frame.architecture ()
     Returns the 'gdb.Architecture' object corresponding to the frame's
     architecture.  *Note Architectures In Python::.

 -- Function: Frame.type ()
     Returns the type of the frame.  The value can be one of:
     'gdb.NORMAL_FRAME'
          An ordinary stack frame.

     'gdb.DUMMY_FRAME'
          A fake stack frame that was created by GDB when performing an
          inferior function call.

     'gdb.INLINE_FRAME'
          A frame representing an inlined function.  The function was
          inlined into a 'gdb.NORMAL_FRAME' that is older than this one.

     'gdb.TAILCALL_FRAME'
          A frame representing a tail call.  *Note Tail Call Frames::.

     'gdb.SIGTRAMP_FRAME'
          A signal trampoline frame.  This is the frame created by the
          OS when it calls into a signal handler.

     'gdb.ARCH_FRAME'
          A fake stack frame representing a cross-architecture call.

     'gdb.SENTINEL_FRAME'
          This is like 'gdb.NORMAL_FRAME', but it is only used for the
          newest frame.

 -- Function: Frame.unwind_stop_reason ()
     Return an integer representing the reason why it's not possible to
     find more frames toward the outermost frame.  Use
     'gdb.frame_stop_reason_string' to convert the value returned by
     this function to a string.  The value can be one of:

     'gdb.FRAME_UNWIND_NO_REASON'
          No particular reason (older frames should be available).

     'gdb.FRAME_UNWIND_NULL_ID'
          The previous frame's analyzer returns an invalid result.  This
          is no longer used by GDB, and is kept only for backward
          compatibility.

     'gdb.FRAME_UNWIND_OUTERMOST'
          This frame is the outermost.

     'gdb.FRAME_UNWIND_UNAVAILABLE'
          Cannot unwind further, because that would require knowing the
          values of registers or memory that have not been collected.

     'gdb.FRAME_UNWIND_INNER_ID'
          This frame ID looks like it ought to belong to a NEXT frame,
          but we got it for a PREV frame.  Normally, this is a sign of
          unwinder failure.  It could also indicate stack corruption.

     'gdb.FRAME_UNWIND_SAME_ID'
          This frame has the same ID as the previous one.  That means
          that unwinding further would almost certainly give us another
          frame with exactly the same ID, so break the chain.  Normally,
          this is a sign of unwinder failure.  It could also indicate
          stack corruption.

     'gdb.FRAME_UNWIND_NO_SAVED_PC'
          The frame unwinder did not find any saved PC, but we needed
          one to unwind further.

     'gdb.FRAME_UNWIND_FIRST_ERROR'
          Any stop reason greater or equal to this value indicates some
          kind of error.  This special value facilitates writing code
          that tests for errors in unwinding in a way that will work
          correctly even if the list of the other values is modified in
          future GDB versions.  Using it, you could write:
               reason = gdb.selected_frame().unwind_stop_reason ()
               reason_str =  gdb.frame_stop_reason_string (reason)
               if reason >=  gdb.FRAME_UNWIND_FIRST_ERROR:
                   print "An error occured: %s" % reason_str

 -- Function: Frame.pc ()
     Returns the frame's resume address.

 -- Function: Frame.block ()
     Return the frame's code block.  *Note Blocks In Python::.

 -- Function: Frame.function ()
     Return the symbol for the function corresponding to this frame.
     *Note Symbols In Python::.

 -- Function: Frame.older ()
     Return the frame that called this frame.

 -- Function: Frame.newer ()
     Return the frame called by this frame.

 -- Function: Frame.find_sal ()
     Return the frame's symtab and line object.  *Note Symbol Tables In
     Python::.

 -- Function: Frame.read_var (variable [, block])
     Return the value of VARIABLE in this frame.  If the optional
     argument BLOCK is provided, search for the variable from that
     block; otherwise start at the frame's current block (which is
     determined by the frame's current program counter).  VARIABLE must
     be a string or a 'gdb.Symbol' object.  BLOCK must be a 'gdb.Block'
     object.

 -- Function: Frame.select ()
     Set this frame to be the selected frame.  *Note Examining the
     Stack: Stack.

23.2.2.21 Accessing blocks from Python.
.......................................

In GDB, symbols are stored in blocks.  A block corresponds roughly to a
scope in the source code.  Blocks are organized hierarchically, and are
represented individually in Python as a 'gdb.Block'.  Blocks rely on
debugging information being available.

   A frame has a block.  Please see *note Frames In Python::, for a more
in-depth discussion of frames.

   The outermost block is known as the "global block".  The global block
typically holds public global variables and functions.

   The block nested just inside the global block is the "static block".
The static block typically holds file-scoped variables and functions.

   GDB provides a method to get a block's superblock, but there is
currently no way to examine the sub-blocks of a block, or to iterate
over all the blocks in a symbol table (*note Symbol Tables In Python::).

   Here is a short example that should help explain blocks:

     /* This is in the global block.  */
     int global;

     /* This is in the static block.  */
     static int file_scope;

     /* 'function' is in the global block, and 'argument' is
        in a block nested inside of 'function'.  */
     int function (int argument)
     {
       /* 'local' is in a block inside 'function'.  It may or may
          not be in the same block as 'argument'.  */
       int local;

       {
          /* 'inner' is in a block whose superblock is the one holding
             'local'.  */
          int inner;

          /* If this call is expanded by the compiler, you may see
             a nested block here whose function is 'inline_function'
             and whose superblock is the one holding 'inner'.  */
          inline_function ();
       }
     }

   A 'gdb.Block' is iterable.  The iterator returns the symbols (*note
Symbols In Python::) local to the block.  Python programs should not
assume that a specific block object will always contain a given symbol,
since changes in GDB features and infrastructure may cause symbols move
across blocks in a symbol table.

   The following block-related functions are available in the 'gdb'
module:

 -- Function: gdb.block_for_pc (pc)
     Return the innermost 'gdb.Block' containing the given PC value.  If
     the block cannot be found for the PC value specified, the function
     will return 'None'.

   A 'gdb.Block' object has the following methods:

 -- Function: Block.is_valid ()
     Returns 'True' if the 'gdb.Block' object is valid, 'False' if not.
     A block object can become invalid if the block it refers to doesn't
     exist anymore in the inferior.  All other 'gdb.Block' methods will
     throw an exception if it is invalid at the time the method is
     called.  The block's validity is also checked during iteration over
     symbols of the block.

   A 'gdb.Block' object has the following attributes:

 -- Variable: Block.start
     The start address of the block.  This attribute is not writable.

 -- Variable: Block.end
     The end address of the block.  This attribute is not writable.

 -- Variable: Block.function
     The name of the block represented as a 'gdb.Symbol'.  If the block
     is not named, then this attribute holds 'None'.  This attribute is
     not writable.

     For ordinary function blocks, the superblock is the static block.
     However, you should note that it is possible for a function block
     to have a superblock that is not the static block - for instance
     this happens for an inlined function.

 -- Variable: Block.superblock
     The block containing this block.  If this parent block does not
     exist, this attribute holds 'None'.  This attribute is not
     writable.

 -- Variable: Block.global_block
     The global block associated with this block.  This attribute is not
     writable.

 -- Variable: Block.static_block
     The static block associated with this block.  This attribute is not
     writable.

 -- Variable: Block.is_global
     'True' if the 'gdb.Block' object is a global block, 'False' if not.
     This attribute is not writable.

 -- Variable: Block.is_static
     'True' if the 'gdb.Block' object is a static block, 'False' if not.
     This attribute is not writable.

23.2.2.22 Python representation of Symbols.
...........................................

GDB represents every variable, function and type as an entry in a symbol
table.  *Note Examining the Symbol Table: Symbols.  Similarly, Python
represents these symbols in GDB with the 'gdb.Symbol' object.

   The following symbol-related functions are available in the 'gdb'
module:

 -- Function: gdb.lookup_symbol (name [, block [, domain]])
     This function searches for a symbol by name.  The search scope can
     be restricted to the parameters defined in the optional domain and
     block arguments.

     NAME is the name of the symbol.  It must be a string.  The optional
     BLOCK argument restricts the search to symbols visible in that
     BLOCK.  The BLOCK argument must be a 'gdb.Block' object.  If
     omitted, the block for the current frame is used.  The optional
     DOMAIN argument restricts the search to the domain type.  The
     DOMAIN argument must be a domain constant defined in the 'gdb'
     module and described later in this chapter.

     The result is a tuple of two elements.  The first element is a
     'gdb.Symbol' object or 'None' if the symbol is not found.  If the
     symbol is found, the second element is 'True' if the symbol is a
     field of a method's object (e.g., 'this' in C++), otherwise it is
     'False'.  If the symbol is not found, the second element is
     'False'.

 -- Function: gdb.lookup_global_symbol (name [, domain])
     This function searches for a global symbol by name.  The search
     scope can be restricted to by the domain argument.

     NAME is the name of the symbol.  It must be a string.  The optional
     DOMAIN argument restricts the search to the domain type.  The
     DOMAIN argument must be a domain constant defined in the 'gdb'
     module and described later in this chapter.

     The result is a 'gdb.Symbol' object or 'None' if the symbol is not
     found.

   A 'gdb.Symbol' object has the following attributes:

 -- Variable: Symbol.type
     The type of the symbol or 'None' if no type is recorded.  This
     attribute is represented as a 'gdb.Type' object.  *Note Types In
     Python::.  This attribute is not writable.

 -- Variable: Symbol.symtab
     The symbol table in which the symbol appears.  This attribute is
     represented as a 'gdb.Symtab' object.  *Note Symbol Tables In
     Python::.  This attribute is not writable.

 -- Variable: Symbol.line
     The line number in the source code at which the symbol was defined.
     This is an integer.

 -- Variable: Symbol.name
     The name of the symbol as a string.  This attribute is not
     writable.

 -- Variable: Symbol.linkage_name
     The name of the symbol, as used by the linker (i.e., may be
     mangled).  This attribute is not writable.

 -- Variable: Symbol.print_name
     The name of the symbol in a form suitable for output.  This is
     either 'name' or 'linkage_name', depending on whether the user
     asked GDB to display demangled or mangled names.

 -- Variable: Symbol.addr_class
     The address class of the symbol.  This classifies how to find the
     value of a symbol.  Each address class is a constant defined in the
     'gdb' module and described later in this chapter.

 -- Variable: Symbol.needs_frame
     This is 'True' if evaluating this symbol's value requires a frame
     (*note Frames In Python::) and 'False' otherwise.  Typically, local
     variables will require a frame, but other symbols will not.

 -- Variable: Symbol.is_argument
     'True' if the symbol is an argument of a function.

 -- Variable: Symbol.is_constant
     'True' if the symbol is a constant.

 -- Variable: Symbol.is_function
     'True' if the symbol is a function or a method.

 -- Variable: Symbol.is_variable
     'True' if the symbol is a variable.

   A 'gdb.Symbol' object has the following methods:

 -- Function: Symbol.is_valid ()
     Returns 'True' if the 'gdb.Symbol' object is valid, 'False' if not.
     A 'gdb.Symbol' object can become invalid if the symbol it refers to
     does not exist in GDB any longer.  All other 'gdb.Symbol' methods
     will throw an exception if it is invalid at the time the method is
     called.

 -- Function: Symbol.value ([frame])
     Compute the value of the symbol, as a 'gdb.Value'.  For functions,
     this computes the address of the function, cast to the appropriate
     type.  If the symbol requires a frame in order to compute its
     value, then FRAME must be given.  If FRAME is not given, or if
     FRAME is invalid, then this method will throw an exception.

   The available domain categories in 'gdb.Symbol' are represented as
constants in the 'gdb' module:

'gdb.SYMBOL_UNDEF_DOMAIN'
     This is used when a domain has not been discovered or none of the
     following domains apply.  This usually indicates an error either in
     the symbol information or in GDB's handling of symbols.
'gdb.SYMBOL_VAR_DOMAIN'
     This domain contains variables, function names, typedef names and
     enum type values.
'gdb.SYMBOL_STRUCT_DOMAIN'
     This domain holds struct, union and enum type names.
'gdb.SYMBOL_LABEL_DOMAIN'
     This domain contains names of labels (for gotos).
'gdb.SYMBOL_VARIABLES_DOMAIN'
     This domain holds a subset of the 'SYMBOLS_VAR_DOMAIN'; it contains
     everything minus functions and types.
'gdb.SYMBOL_FUNCTION_DOMAIN'
     This domain contains all functions.
'gdb.SYMBOL_TYPES_DOMAIN'
     This domain contains all types.

   The available address class categories in 'gdb.Symbol' are
represented as constants in the 'gdb' module:

'gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_UNDEF'
     If this is returned by address class, it indicates an error either
     in the symbol information or in GDB's handling of symbols.
'gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_CONST'
     Value is constant int.
'gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_STATIC'
     Value is at a fixed address.
'gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_REGISTER'
     Value is in a register.
'gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_ARG'
     Value is an argument.  This value is at the offset stored within
     the symbol inside the frame's argument list.
'gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_REF_ARG'
     Value address is stored in the frame's argument list.  Just like
     'LOC_ARG' except that the value's address is stored at the offset,
     not the value itself.
'gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_REGPARM_ADDR'
     Value is a specified register.  Just like 'LOC_REGISTER' except the
     register holds the address of the argument instead of the argument
     itself.
'gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_LOCAL'
     Value is a local variable.
'gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_TYPEDEF'
     Value not used.  Symbols in the domain 'SYMBOL_STRUCT_DOMAIN' all
     have this class.
'gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_BLOCK'
     Value is a block.
'gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_CONST_BYTES'
     Value is a byte-sequence.
'gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_UNRESOLVED'
     Value is at a fixed address, but the address of the variable has to
     be determined from the minimal symbol table whenever the variable
     is referenced.
'gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_OPTIMIZED_OUT'
     The value does not actually exist in the program.
'gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_COMPUTED'
     The value's address is a computed location.

23.2.2.23 Symbol table representation in Python.
................................................

Access to symbol table data maintained by GDB on the inferior is exposed
to Python via two objects: 'gdb.Symtab_and_line' and 'gdb.Symtab'.
Symbol table and line data for a frame is returned from the 'find_sal'
method in 'gdb.Frame' object.  *Note Frames In Python::.

   For more information on GDB's symbol table management, see *note
Examining the Symbol Table: Symbols, for more information.

   A 'gdb.Symtab_and_line' object has the following attributes:

 -- Variable: Symtab_and_line.symtab
     The symbol table object ('gdb.Symtab') for this frame.  This
     attribute is not writable.

 -- Variable: Symtab_and_line.pc
     Indicates the start of the address range occupied by code for the
     current source line.  This attribute is not writable.

 -- Variable: Symtab_and_line.last
     Indicates the end of the address range occupied by code for the
     current source line.  This attribute is not writable.

 -- Variable: Symtab_and_line.line
     Indicates the current line number for this object.  This attribute
     is not writable.

   A 'gdb.Symtab_and_line' object has the following methods:

 -- Function: Symtab_and_line.is_valid ()
     Returns 'True' if the 'gdb.Symtab_and_line' object is valid,
     'False' if not.  A 'gdb.Symtab_and_line' object can become invalid
     if the Symbol table and line object it refers to does not exist in
     GDB any longer.  All other 'gdb.Symtab_and_line' methods will throw
     an exception if it is invalid at the time the method is called.

   A 'gdb.Symtab' object has the following attributes:

 -- Variable: Symtab.filename
     The symbol table's source filename.  This attribute is not
     writable.

 -- Variable: Symtab.objfile
     The symbol table's backing object file.  *Note Objfiles In
     Python::.  This attribute is not writable.

   A 'gdb.Symtab' object has the following methods:

 -- Function: Symtab.is_valid ()
     Returns 'True' if the 'gdb.Symtab' object is valid, 'False' if not.
     A 'gdb.Symtab' object can become invalid if the symbol table it
     refers to does not exist in GDB any longer.  All other 'gdb.Symtab'
     methods will throw an exception if it is invalid at the time the
     method is called.

 -- Function: Symtab.fullname ()
     Return the symbol table's source absolute file name.

 -- Function: Symtab.global_block ()
     Return the global block of the underlying symbol table.  *Note
     Blocks In Python::.

 -- Function: Symtab.static_block ()
     Return the static block of the underlying symbol table.  *Note
     Blocks In Python::.

 -- Function: Symtab.linetable ()
     Return the line table associated with the symbol table.  *Note Line
     Tables In Python::.

23.2.2.24 Manipulating line tables using Python
...............................................

Python code can request and inspect line table information from a symbol
table that is loaded in GDB.  A line table is a mapping of source lines
to their executable locations in memory.  To acquire the line table
information for a particular symbol table, use the 'linetable' function
(*note Symbol Tables In Python::).

   A 'gdb.LineTable' is iterable.  The iterator returns 'LineTableEntry'
objects that correspond to the source line and address for each line
table entry.  'LineTableEntry' objects have the following attributes:

 -- Variable: LineTableEntry.line
     The source line number for this line table entry.  This number
     corresponds to the actual line of source.  This attribute is not
     writable.

 -- Variable: LineTableEntry.pc
     The address that is associated with the line table entry where the
     executable code for that source line resides in memory.  This
     attribute is not writable.

   As there can be multiple addresses for a single source line, you may
receive multiple 'LineTableEntry' objects with matching 'line'
attributes, but with different 'pc' attributes.  The iterator is sorted
in ascending 'pc' order.  Here is a small example illustrating iterating
over a line table.

     symtab = gdb.selected_frame().find_sal().symtab
     linetable = symtab.linetable()
     for line in linetable:
        print "Line: "+str(line.line)+" Address: "+hex(line.pc)

   This will have the following output:

     Line: 33 Address: 0x4005c8L
     Line: 37 Address: 0x4005caL
     Line: 39 Address: 0x4005d2L
     Line: 40 Address: 0x4005f8L
     Line: 42 Address: 0x4005ffL
     Line: 44 Address: 0x400608L
     Line: 42 Address: 0x40060cL
     Line: 45 Address: 0x400615L

   In addition to being able to iterate over a 'LineTable', it also has
the following direct access methods:

 -- Function: LineTable.line (line)
     Return a Python 'Tuple' of 'LineTableEntry' objects for any entries
     in the line table for the given LINE.  LINE refers to the source
     code line.  If there are no entries for that source code LINE, the
     Python 'None' is returned.

 -- Function: LineTable.has_line (line)
     Return a Python 'Boolean' indicating whether there is an entry in
     the line table for this source line.  Return 'True' if an entry is
     found, or 'False' if not.

 -- Function: LineTable.source_lines ()
     Return a Python 'List' of the source line numbers in the symbol
     table.  Only lines with executable code locations are returned.
     The contents of the 'List' will just be the source line entries
     represented as Python 'Long' values.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Breakpoints In Python,  Next: Finish Breakpoints in Python,  Prev: Line Tables In Python,  Up: Python API

23.2.2.25 Manipulating breakpoints using Python
...............................................

Python code can manipulate breakpoints via the 'gdb.Breakpoint' class.

 -- Function: Breakpoint.__init__ (spec [, type [, wp_class [,internal
          [,temporary]]]])
     Create a new breakpoint.  SPEC is a string naming the location of
     the breakpoint, or an expression that defines a watchpoint.  The
     contents can be any location recognized by the 'break' command, or
     in the case of a watchpoint, by the 'watch' command.  The optional
     TYPE denotes the breakpoint to create from the types defined later
     in this chapter.  This argument can be either: 'gdb.BP_BREAKPOINT'
     or 'gdb.BP_WATCHPOINT'.  TYPE defaults to 'gdb.BP_BREAKPOINT'.  The
     optional INTERNAL argument allows the breakpoint to become
     invisible to the user.  The breakpoint will neither be reported
     when created, nor will it be listed in the output from 'info
     breakpoints' (but will be listed with the 'maint info breakpoints'
     command).  The optional TEMPORARY argument makes the breakpoint a
     temporary breakpoint.  Temporary breakpoints are deleted after they
     have been hit.  Any further access to the Python breakpoint after
     it has been hit will result in a runtime error (as that breakpoint
     has now been automatically deleted).  The optional WP_CLASS
     argument defines the class of watchpoint to create, if TYPE is
     'gdb.BP_WATCHPOINT'.  If a watchpoint class is not provided, it is
     assumed to be a 'gdb.WP_WRITE' class.

 -- Function: Breakpoint.stop (self)
     The 'gdb.Breakpoint' class can be sub-classed and, in particular,
     you may choose to implement the 'stop' method.  If this method is
     defined in a sub-class of 'gdb.Breakpoint', it will be called when
     the inferior reaches any location of a breakpoint which
     instantiates that sub-class.  If the method returns 'True', the
     inferior will be stopped at the location of the breakpoint,
     otherwise the inferior will continue.

     If there are multiple breakpoints at the same location with a
     'stop' method, each one will be called regardless of the return
     status of the previous.  This ensures that all 'stop' methods have
     a chance to execute at that location.  In this scenario if one of
     the methods returns 'True' but the others return 'False', the
     inferior will still be stopped.

     You should not alter the execution state of the inferior (i.e.,
     step, next, etc.), alter the current frame context (i.e., change
     the current active frame), or alter, add or delete any breakpoint.
     As a general rule, you should not alter any data within GDB or the
     inferior at this time.

     Example 'stop' implementation:

          class MyBreakpoint (gdb.Breakpoint):
                def stop (self):
                  inf_val = gdb.parse_and_eval("foo")
                  if inf_val == 3:
                    return True
                  return False

   The available watchpoint types represented by constants are defined
in the 'gdb' module:

'gdb.WP_READ'
     Read only watchpoint.

'gdb.WP_WRITE'
     Write only watchpoint.

'gdb.WP_ACCESS'
     Read/Write watchpoint.

 -- Function: Breakpoint.is_valid ()
     Return 'True' if this 'Breakpoint' object is valid, 'False'
     otherwise.  A 'Breakpoint' object can become invalid if the user
     deletes the breakpoint.  In this case, the object still exists, but
     the underlying breakpoint does not.  In the cases of watchpoint
     scope, the watchpoint remains valid even if execution of the
     inferior leaves the scope of that watchpoint.

 -- Function: Breakpoint.delete
     Permanently deletes the GDB breakpoint.  This also invalidates the
     Python 'Breakpoint' object.  Any further access to this object's
     attributes or methods will raise an error.

 -- Variable: Breakpoint.enabled
     This attribute is 'True' if the breakpoint is enabled, and 'False'
     otherwise.  This attribute is writable.

 -- Variable: Breakpoint.silent
     This attribute is 'True' if the breakpoint is silent, and 'False'
     otherwise.  This attribute is writable.

     Note that a breakpoint can also be silent if it has commands and
     the first command is 'silent'.  This is not reported by the
     'silent' attribute.

 -- Variable: Breakpoint.thread
     If the breakpoint is thread-specific, this attribute holds the
     thread id.  If the breakpoint is not thread-specific, this
     attribute is 'None'.  This attribute is writable.

 -- Variable: Breakpoint.task
     If the breakpoint is Ada task-specific, this attribute holds the
     Ada task id.  If the breakpoint is not task-specific (or the
     underlying language is not Ada), this attribute is 'None'.  This
     attribute is writable.

 -- Variable: Breakpoint.ignore_count
     This attribute holds the ignore count for the breakpoint, an
     integer.  This attribute is writable.

 -- Variable: Breakpoint.number
     This attribute holds the breakpoint's number -- the identifier used
     by the user to manipulate the breakpoint.  This attribute is not
     writable.

 -- Variable: Breakpoint.type
     This attribute holds the breakpoint's type -- the identifier used
     to determine the actual breakpoint type or use-case.  This
     attribute is not writable.

 -- Variable: Breakpoint.visible
     This attribute tells whether the breakpoint is visible to the user
     when set, or when the 'info breakpoints' command is run.  This
     attribute is not writable.

 -- Variable: Breakpoint.temporary
     This attribute indicates whether the breakpoint was created as a
     temporary breakpoint.  Temporary breakpoints are automatically
     deleted after that breakpoint has been hit.  Access to this
     attribute, and all other attributes and functions other than the
     'is_valid' function, will result in an error after the breakpoint
     has been hit (as it has been automatically deleted).  This
     attribute is not writable.

   The available types are represented by constants defined in the 'gdb'
module:

'gdb.BP_BREAKPOINT'
     Normal code breakpoint.

'gdb.BP_WATCHPOINT'
     Watchpoint breakpoint.

'gdb.BP_HARDWARE_WATCHPOINT'
     Hardware assisted watchpoint.

'gdb.BP_READ_WATCHPOINT'
     Hardware assisted read watchpoint.

'gdb.BP_ACCESS_WATCHPOINT'
     Hardware assisted access watchpoint.

 -- Variable: Breakpoint.hit_count
     This attribute holds the hit count for the breakpoint, an integer.
     This attribute is writable, but currently it can only be set to
     zero.

 -- Variable: Breakpoint.location
     This attribute holds the location of the breakpoint, as specified
     by the user.  It is a string.  If the breakpoint does not have a
     location (that is, it is a watchpoint) the attribute's value is
     'None'.  This attribute is not writable.

 -- Variable: Breakpoint.expression
     This attribute holds a breakpoint expression, as specified by the
     user.  It is a string.  If the breakpoint does not have an
     expression (the breakpoint is not a watchpoint) the attribute's
     value is 'None'.  This attribute is not writable.

 -- Variable: Breakpoint.condition
     This attribute holds the condition of the breakpoint, as specified
     by the user.  It is a string.  If there is no condition, this
     attribute's value is 'None'.  This attribute is writable.

 -- Variable: Breakpoint.commands
     This attribute holds the commands attached to the breakpoint.  If
     there are commands, this attribute's value is a string holding all
     the commands, separated by newlines.  If there are no commands,
     this attribute is 'None'.  This attribute is not writable.

23.2.2.26 Finish Breakpoints
............................

A finish breakpoint is a temporary breakpoint set at the return address
of a frame, based on the 'finish' command.  'gdb.FinishBreakpoint'
extends 'gdb.Breakpoint'.  The underlying breakpoint will be disabled
and deleted when the execution will run out of the breakpoint scope
(i.e. 'Breakpoint.stop' or 'FinishBreakpoint.out_of_scope' triggered).
Finish breakpoints are thread specific and must be create with the right
thread selected.

 -- Function: FinishBreakpoint.__init__ ([frame] [, internal])
     Create a finish breakpoint at the return address of the 'gdb.Frame'
     object FRAME.  If FRAME is not provided, this defaults to the
     newest frame.  The optional INTERNAL argument allows the breakpoint
     to become invisible to the user.  *Note Breakpoints In Python::,
     for further details about this argument.

 -- Function: FinishBreakpoint.out_of_scope (self)
     In some circumstances (e.g. 'longjmp', C++ exceptions, GDB 'return'
     command, ...), a function may not properly terminate, and thus
     never hit the finish breakpoint.  When GDB notices such a
     situation, the 'out_of_scope' callback will be triggered.

     You may want to sub-class 'gdb.FinishBreakpoint' and override this
     method:

          class MyFinishBreakpoint (gdb.FinishBreakpoint)
              def stop (self):
                  print "normal finish"
                  return True

              def out_of_scope ():
                  print "abnormal finish"

 -- Variable: FinishBreakpoint.return_value
     When GDB is stopped at a finish breakpoint and the frame used to
     build the 'gdb.FinishBreakpoint' object had debug symbols, this
     attribute will contain a 'gdb.Value' object corresponding to the
     return value of the function.  The value will be 'None' if the
     function return type is 'void' or if the return value was not
     computable.  This attribute is not writable.

23.2.2.27 Python representation of lazy strings.
................................................

A "lazy string" is a string whose contents is not retrieved or encoded
until it is needed.

   A 'gdb.LazyString' is represented in GDB as an 'address' that points
to a region of memory, an 'encoding' that will be used to encode that
region of memory, and a 'length' to delimit the region of memory that
represents the string.  The difference between a 'gdb.LazyString' and a
string wrapped within a 'gdb.Value' is that a 'gdb.LazyString' will be
treated differently by GDB when printing.  A 'gdb.LazyString' is
retrieved and encoded during printing, while a 'gdb.Value' wrapping a
string is immediately retrieved and encoded on creation.

   A 'gdb.LazyString' object has the following functions:

 -- Function: LazyString.value ()
     Convert the 'gdb.LazyString' to a 'gdb.Value'.  This value will
     point to the string in memory, but will lose all the delayed
     retrieval, encoding and handling that GDB applies to a
     'gdb.LazyString'.

 -- Variable: LazyString.address
     This attribute holds the address of the string.  This attribute is
     not writable.

 -- Variable: LazyString.length
     This attribute holds the length of the string in characters.  If
     the length is -1, then the string will be fetched and encoded up to
     the first null of appropriate width.  This attribute is not
     writable.

 -- Variable: LazyString.encoding
     This attribute holds the encoding that will be applied to the
     string when the string is printed by GDB.  If the encoding is not
     set, or contains an empty string, then GDB will select the most
     appropriate encoding when the string is printed.  This attribute is
     not writable.

 -- Variable: LazyString.type
     This attribute holds the type that is represented by the lazy
     string's type.  For a lazy string this will always be a pointer
     type.  To resolve this to the lazy string's character type, use the
     type's 'target' method.  *Note Types In Python::.  This attribute
     is not writable.

23.2.2.28 Python representation of architectures
................................................

GDB uses architecture specific parameters and artifacts in a number of
its various computations.  An architecture is represented by an instance
of the 'gdb.Architecture' class.

   A 'gdb.Architecture' class has the following methods:

 -- Function: Architecture.name ()
     Return the name (string value) of the architecture.

 -- Function: Architecture.disassemble (START_PC [, END_PC [, COUNT]])
     Return a list of disassembled instructions starting from the memory
     address START_PC.  The optional arguments END_PC and COUNT
     determine the number of instructions in the returned list.  If both
     the optional arguments END_PC and COUNT are specified, then a list
     of at most COUNT disassembled instructions whose start address
     falls in the closed memory address interval from START_PC to END_PC
     are returned.  If END_PC is not specified, but COUNT is specified,
     then COUNT number of instructions starting from the address
     START_PC are returned.  If COUNT is not specified but END_PC is
     specified, then all instructions whose start address falls in the
     closed memory address interval from START_PC to END_PC are
     returned.  If neither END_PC nor COUNT are specified, then a single
     instruction at START_PC is returned.  For all of these cases, each
     element of the returned list is a Python 'dict' with the following
     string keys:

     'addr'
          The value corresponding to this key is a Python long integer
          capturing the memory address of the instruction.

     'asm'
          The value corresponding to this key is a string value which
          represents the instruction with assembly language mnemonics.
          The assembly language flavor used is the same as that
          specified by the current CLI variable 'disassembly-flavor'.
          *Note Machine Code::.

     'length'
          The value corresponding to this key is the length (integer
          value) of the instruction in bytes.

23.2.3 Python Auto-loading
--------------------------

When a new object file is read (for example, due to the 'file' command,
or because the inferior has loaded a shared library), GDB will look for
Python support scripts in several ways: 'OBJFILE-gdb.py' and
'.debug_gdb_scripts' section.  *Note Auto-loading extensions::.

   The auto-loading feature is useful for supplying application-specific
debugging commands and scripts.

   Auto-loading can be enabled or disabled, and the list of auto-loaded
scripts can be printed.

'set auto-load python-scripts [on|off]'
     Enable or disable the auto-loading of Python scripts.

'show auto-load python-scripts'
     Show whether auto-loading of Python scripts is enabled or disabled.

'info auto-load python-scripts [REGEXP]'
     Print the list of all Python scripts that GDB auto-loaded.

     Also printed is the list of Python scripts that were mentioned in
     the '.debug_gdb_scripts' section and were not found (*note
     dotdebug_gdb_scripts section::).  This is useful because their
     names are not printed when GDB tries to load them and fails.  There
     may be many of them, and printing an error message for each one is
     problematic.

     If REGEXP is supplied only Python scripts with matching names are
     printed.

     Example:

          (gdb) info auto-load python-scripts
          Loaded Script
          Yes    py-section-script.py
                 full name: /tmp/py-section-script.py
          No     my-foo-pretty-printers.py

   When reading an auto-loaded file, GDB sets the "current objfile".
This is available via the 'gdb.current_objfile' function (*note Objfiles
In Python::).  This can be useful for registering objfile-specific
pretty-printers and frame-filters.

23.2.4 Python modules
---------------------

GDB comes with several modules to assist writing Python code.

* Menu:

* gdb.printing::       Building and registering pretty-printers.

* gdb.prompt::         Utilities for prompt value substitution.

23.2.4.1 gdb.printing
.....................

This module provides a collection of utilities for working with
pretty-printers.

'PrettyPrinter (NAME, SUBPRINTERS=None)'
     This class specifies the API that makes 'info pretty-printer',
     'enable pretty-printer' and 'disable pretty-printer' work.
     Pretty-printers should generally inherit from this class.

'SubPrettyPrinter (NAME)'
     For printers that handle multiple types, this class specifies the
     corresponding API for the subprinters.

'RegexpCollectionPrettyPrinter (NAME)'
     Utility class for handling multiple printers, all recognized via
     regular expressions.  *Note Writing a Pretty-Printer::, for an
     example.

'FlagEnumerationPrinter (NAME)'
     A pretty-printer which handles printing of 'enum' values.  Unlike
     GDB's built-in 'enum' printing, this printer attempts to work
     properly when there is some overlap between the enumeration
     constants.  NAME is the name of the printer and also the name of
     the 'enum' type to look up.

'register_pretty_printer (OBJ, PRINTER, REPLACE=False)'
     Register PRINTER with the pretty-printer list of OBJ.  If REPLACE
     is 'True' then any existing copy of the printer is replaced.
     Otherwise a 'RuntimeError' exception is raised if a printer with
     the same name already exists.

23.2.4.2 gdb.types
..................

This module provides a collection of utilities for working with
'gdb.Type' objects.

'get_basic_type (TYPE)'
     Return TYPE with const and volatile qualifiers stripped, and with
     typedefs and C++ references converted to the underlying type.

     C++ example:

          typedef const int const_int;
          const_int foo (3);
          const_int& foo_ref (foo);
          int main () { return 0; }

     Then in gdb:

          (gdb) start
          (gdb) python import gdb.types
          (gdb) python foo_ref = gdb.parse_and_eval("foo_ref")
          (gdb) python print gdb.types.get_basic_type(foo_ref.type)
          int

'has_field (TYPE, FIELD)'
     Return 'True' if TYPE, assumed to be a type with fields (e.g., a
     structure or union), has field FIELD.

'make_enum_dict (ENUM_TYPE)'
     Return a Python 'dictionary' type produced from ENUM_TYPE.

'deep_items (TYPE)'
     Returns a Python iterator similar to the standard
     'gdb.Type.iteritems' method, except that the iterator returned by
     'deep_items' will recursively traverse anonymous struct or union
     fields.  For example:

          struct A
          {
              int a;
              union {
                  int b0;
                  int b1;
              };
          };

     Then in GDB:
          (gdb) python import gdb.types
          (gdb) python struct_a = gdb.lookup_type("struct A")
          (gdb) python print struct_a.keys ()
          {['a', '']}
          (gdb) python print [k for k,v in gdb.types.deep_items(struct_a)]
          {['a', 'b0', 'b1']}

'get_type_recognizers ()'
     Return a list of the enabled type recognizers for the current
     context.  This is called by GDB during the type-printing process
     (*note Type Printing API::).

'apply_type_recognizers (recognizers, type_obj)'
     Apply the type recognizers, RECOGNIZERS, to the type object
     TYPE_OBJ.  If any recognizer returns a string, return that string.
     Otherwise, return 'None'.  This is called by GDB during the
     type-printing process (*note Type Printing API::).

'register_type_printer (locus, printer)'
     This is a convenience function to register a type printer.  PRINTER
     is the type printer to register.  It must implement the type
     printer protocol.  LOCUS is either a 'gdb.Objfile', in which case
     the printer is registered with that objfile; a 'gdb.Progspace', in
     which case the printer is registered with that progspace; or
     'None', in which case the printer is registered globally.

'TypePrinter'
     This is a base class that implements the type printer protocol.
     Type printers are encouraged, but not required, to derive from this
     class.  It defines a constructor:

23.2.4.3 gdb.prompt
...................

This module provides a method for prompt value-substitution.

'substitute_prompt (STRING)'
     Return STRING with escape sequences substituted by values.  Some
     escape sequences take arguments.  You can specify arguments inside
     "{}" immediately following the escape sequence.

     The escape sequences you can pass to this function are:

     '\\'
          Substitute a backslash.
     '\e'
          Substitute an ESC character.
     '\f'
          Substitute the selected frame; an argument names a frame
          parameter.
     '\n'
          Substitute a newline.
     '\p'
          Substitute a parameter's value; the argument names the
          parameter.
     '\r'
          Substitute a carriage return.
     '\t'
          Substitute the selected thread; an argument names a thread
          parameter.
     '\v'
          Substitute the version of GDB.
     '\w'
          Substitute the current working directory.
     '\['
          Begin a sequence of non-printing characters.  These sequences
          are typically used with the ESC character, and are not counted
          in the string length.  Example: "\[\e[0;34m\](gdb)\[\e[0m\]"
          will return a blue-colored "(gdb)" prompt where the length is
          five.
     '\]'
          End a sequence of non-printing characters.

     For example:

          substitute_prompt (``frame: \f,
                             print arguments: \p{print frame-arguments}'')

will return the string:

          "frame: main, print arguments: scalars"

23.3 Auto-loading extensions
============================

GDB provides two mechanisms for automatically loading extensions when a
new object file is read (for example, due to the 'file' command, or
because the inferior has loaded a shared library): 'OBJFILE-gdb.EXT' and
the '.debug_gdb_scripts' section of modern file formats like ELF.

* Menu:

* objfile-gdb.ext file: objfile-gdbdotext file.  The 'OBJFILE-gdb.EXT' file
* .debug_gdb_scripts section: dotdebug_gdb_scripts section.  The '.debug_gdb_scripts' section
* Which flavor to choose?::

   The auto-loading feature is useful for supplying application-specific
debugging commands and features.

   Auto-loading can be enabled or disabled, and the list of auto-loaded
scripts can be printed.  See the 'auto-loading' section of each
extension language for more information.  For GDB command files see
*note Auto-loading sequences::.  For Python files see *note Python
Auto-loading::.

   Note that loading of this script file also requires accordingly
configured 'auto-load safe-path' (*note Auto-loading safe path::).


File: gdb.info,  Node: objfile-gdbdotext file,  Next: dotdebug_gdb_scripts section,  Up: Auto-loading extensions

23.3.1 The 'OBJFILE-gdb.EXT' file
---------------------------------

When a new object file is read, GDB looks for a file named
'OBJFILE-gdb.EXT' (we call it SCRIPT-NAME below), where OBJFILE is the
object file's name and where EXT is the file extension for the extension
language:

'OBJFILE-gdb.gdb'
     GDB's own command language
'OBJFILE-gdb.py'
     Python

   SCRIPT-NAME is formed by ensuring that the file name of OBJFILE is
absolute, following all symlinks, and resolving '.' and '..' components,
and appending the '-gdb.EXT' suffix.  If this file exists and is
readable, GDB will evaluate it as a script in the specified extension
language.

   If this file does not exist, then GDB will look for SCRIPT-NAME file
in all of the directories as specified below.

   Note that loading of these files requires an accordingly configured
'auto-load safe-path' (*note Auto-loading safe path::).

   For object files using '.exe' suffix GDB tries to load first the
scripts normally according to its '.exe' filename.  But if no scripts
are found GDB also tries script filenames matching the object file
without its '.exe' suffix.  This '.exe' stripping is case insensitive
and it is attempted on any platform.  This makes the script filenames
compatible between Unix and MS-Windows hosts.

'set auto-load scripts-directory [DIRECTORIES]'
     Control GDB auto-loaded scripts location.  Multiple directory
     entries may be delimited by the host platform path separator in use
     (':' on Unix, ';' on MS-Windows and MS-DOS).

     Each entry here needs to be covered also by the security setting
     'set auto-load safe-path' (*note set auto-load safe-path::).

     This variable defaults to '$debugdir:$datadir/auto-load'.  The
     default 'set auto-load safe-path' value can be also overriden by
     GDB configuration option '--with-auto-load-dir'.

     Any reference to '$debugdir' will get replaced by
     DEBUG-FILE-DIRECTORY value (*note Separate Debug Files::) and any
     reference to '$datadir' will get replaced by DATA-DIRECTORY which
     is determined at GDB startup (*note Data Files::).  '$debugdir' and
     '$datadir' must be placed as a directory component -- either alone
     or delimited by '/' or '\' directory separators, depending on the
     host platform.

     The list of directories uses path separator (':' on GNU and Unix
     systems, ';' on MS-Windows and MS-DOS) to separate directories,
     similarly to the 'PATH' environment variable.

'show auto-load scripts-directory'
     Show GDB auto-loaded scripts location.

   GDB does not track which files it has already auto-loaded this way.
GDB will load the associated script every time the corresponding OBJFILE
is opened.  So your '-gdb.EXT' file should be careful to avoid errors if
it is evaluated more than once.


File: gdb.info,  Node: dotdebug_gdb_scripts section,  Next: Which flavor to choose?,  Prev: objfile-gdbdotext file,  Up: Auto-loading extensions

23.3.2 The '.debug_gdb_scripts' section
---------------------------------------

For systems using file formats like ELF and COFF, when GDB loads a new
object file it will look for a special section named
'.debug_gdb_scripts'.  If this section exists, its contents is a list of
NUL-terminated names of scripts to load.  Each entry begins with a
non-NULL prefix byte that specifies the kind of entry, typically the
extension language.

   GDB will look for each specified script file first in the current
directory and then along the source search path (*note Specifying Source
Directories: Source Path.), except that '$cdir' is not searched, since
the compilation directory is not relevant to scripts.

   Entries can be placed in section '.debug_gdb_scripts' with, for
example, this GCC macro for Python scripts.

     /* Note: The "MS" section flags are to remove duplicates.  */
     #define DEFINE_GDB_PY_SCRIPT(script_name) \
       asm("\
     .pushsection \".debug_gdb_scripts\", \"MS\",@progbits,1\n\
     .byte 1 /* Python */\n\
     .asciz \"" script_name "\"\n\
     .popsection \n\
     ");

Then one can reference the macro in a header or source file like this:

     DEFINE_GDB_PY_SCRIPT ("my-app-scripts.py")

   The script name may include directories if desired.

   Note that loading of this script file also requires accordingly
configured 'auto-load safe-path' (*note Auto-loading safe path::).

   If the macro invocation is put in a header, any application or
library using this header will get a reference to the specified script,
and with the use of '"MS"' attributes on the section, the linker will
remove duplicates.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Which flavor to choose?,  Prev: dotdebug_gdb_scripts section,  Up: Auto-loading extensions

23.3.3 Which flavor to choose?
------------------------------

Given the multiple ways of auto-loading extensions, it might not always
be clear which one to choose.  This section provides some guidance.

Benefits of the '-gdb.EXT' way:

   * Can be used with file formats that don't support multiple sections.

   * Ease of finding scripts for public libraries.

     Scripts specified in the '.debug_gdb_scripts' section are searched
     for in the source search path.  For publicly installed libraries,
     e.g., 'libstdc++', there typically isn't a source directory in
     which to find the script.

   * Doesn't require source code additions.

Benefits of the '.debug_gdb_scripts' way:

   * Works with static linking.

     Scripts for libraries done the '-gdb.EXT' way require an objfile to
     trigger their loading.  When an application is statically linked
     the only objfile available is the executable, and it is cumbersome
     to attach all the scripts from all the input libraries to the
     executable's '-gdb.EXT' script.

   * Works with classes that are entirely inlined.

     Some classes can be entirely inlined, and thus there may not be an
     associated shared library to attach a '-gdb.EXT' script to.

   * Scripts needn't be copied out of the source tree.

     In some circumstances, apps can be built out of large collections
     of internal libraries, and the build infrastructure necessary to
     install the '-gdb.EXT' scripts in a place where GDB can find them
     is cumbersome.  It may be easier to specify the scripts in the
     '.debug_gdb_scripts' section as relative paths, and add a path to
     the top of the source tree to the source search path.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Aliases,  Prev: Auto-loading extensions,  Up: Extending GDB

23.4 Creating new spellings of existing commands
================================================

It is often useful to define alternate spellings of existing commands.
For example, if a new GDB command defined in Python has a long name to
type, it is handy to have an abbreviated version of it that involves
less typing.

   GDB itself uses aliases.  For example 's' is an alias of the 'step'
command even though it is otherwise an ambiguous abbreviation of other
commands like 'set' and 'show'.

   Aliases are also used to provide shortened or more common versions of
multi-word commands.  For example, GDB provides the 'tty' alias of the
'set inferior-tty' command.

   You can define a new alias with the 'alias' command.

'alias [-a] [--] ALIAS = COMMAND'

   ALIAS specifies the name of the new alias.  Each word of ALIAS must
consist of letters, numbers, dashes and underscores.

   COMMAND specifies the name of an existing command that is being
aliased.

   The '-a' option specifies that the new alias is an abbreviation of
the command.  Abbreviations are not shown in command lists displayed by
the 'help' command.

   The '--' option specifies the end of options, and is useful when
ALIAS begins with a dash.

   Here is a simple example showing how to make an abbreviation of a
command so that there is less to type.  Suppose you were tired of typing
'disas', the current shortest unambiguous abbreviation of the
'disassemble' command and you wanted an even shorter version named 'di'.
The following will accomplish this.

     (gdb) alias -a di = disas

   Note that aliases are different from user-defined commands.  With a
user-defined command, you also need to write documentation for it with
the 'document' command.  An alias automatically picks up the
documentation of the existing command.

   Here is an example where we make 'elms' an abbreviation of 'elements'
in the 'set print elements' command.  This is to show that you can make
an abbreviation of any part of a command.

     (gdb) alias -a set print elms = set print elements
     (gdb) alias -a show print elms = show print elements
     (gdb) set p elms 20
     (gdb) show p elms
     Limit on string chars or array elements to print is 200.

   Note that if you are defining an alias of a 'set' command, and you
want to have an alias for the corresponding 'show' command, then you
need to define the latter separately.

   Unambiguously abbreviated commands are allowed in COMMAND and ALIAS,
just as they are normally.

     (gdb) alias -a set pr elms = set p ele

   Finally, here is an example showing the creation of a one word alias
for a more complex command.  This creates alias 'spe' of the command
'set print elements'.

     (gdb) alias spe = set print elements
     (gdb) spe 20

24 Command Interpreters
***********************

GDB supports multiple command interpreters, and some command
infrastructure to allow users or user interface writers to switch
between interpreters or run commands in other interpreters.

   GDB currently supports two command interpreters, the console
interpreter (sometimes called the command-line interpreter or CLI) and
the machine interface interpreter (or GDB/MI).  This manual describes
both of these interfaces in great detail.

   By default, GDB will start with the console interpreter.  However,
the user may choose to start GDB with another interpreter by specifying
the '-i' or '--interpreter' startup options.  Defined interpreters
include:

'console'
     The traditional console or command-line interpreter.  This is the
     most often used interpreter with GDB.  With no interpreter
     specified at runtime, GDB will use this interpreter.

'mi'
     The newest GDB/MI interface (currently 'mi2').  Used primarily by
     programs wishing to use GDB as a backend for a debugger GUI or an
     IDE. For more information, see *note The GDB/MI Interface: GDB/MI.

'mi2'
     The current GDB/MI interface.

'mi1'
     The GDB/MI interface included in GDB 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3.

   The interpreter being used by GDB may not be dynamically switched at
runtime.  Although possible, this could lead to a very precarious
situation.  Consider an IDE using GDB/MI.  If a user enters the command
"interpreter-set console" in a console view, GDB would switch to using
the console interpreter, rendering the IDE inoperable!

   Although you may only choose a single interpreter at startup, you may
execute commands in any interpreter from the current interpreter using
the appropriate command.  If you are running the console interpreter,
simply use the 'interpreter-exec' command:

     interpreter-exec mi "-data-list-register-names"

   GDB/MI has a similar command, although it is only available in
versions of GDB which support GDB/MI version 2 (or greater).

25 GDB Text User Interface
**************************

* Menu:

* TUI Overview::                TUI overview
* TUI Keys::                    TUI key bindings
* TUI Single Key Mode::         TUI single key mode
* TUI Commands::                TUI-specific commands
* TUI Configuration::           TUI configuration variables

The GDB Text User Interface (TUI) is a terminal interface which uses the
'curses' library to show the source file, the assembly output, the
program registers and GDB commands in separate text windows.  The TUI
mode is supported only on platforms where a suitable version of the
'curses' library is available.

   The TUI mode is enabled by default when you invoke GDB as 'gdb -tui'.
You can also switch in and out of TUI mode while GDB runs by using
various TUI commands and key bindings, such as 'C-x C-a'.  *Note TUI Key
Bindings: TUI Keys.


File: gdb.info,  Node: TUI Overview,  Next: TUI Keys,  Up: TUI

25.1 TUI Overview
=================

In TUI mode, GDB can display several text windows:

_command_
     This window is the GDB command window with the GDB prompt and the
     GDB output.  The GDB input is still managed using readline.

_source_
     The source window shows the source file of the program.  The
     current line and active breakpoints are displayed in this window.

_assembly_
     The assembly window shows the disassembly output of the program.

_register_
     This window shows the processor registers.  Registers are
     highlighted when their values change.

   The source and assembly windows show the current program position by
highlighting the current line and marking it with a '>' marker.
Breakpoints are indicated with two markers.  The first marker indicates
the breakpoint type:

'B'
     Breakpoint which was hit at least once.

'b'
     Breakpoint which was never hit.

'H'
     Hardware breakpoint which was hit at least once.

'h'
     Hardware breakpoint which was never hit.

   The second marker indicates whether the breakpoint is enabled or not:

'+'
     Breakpoint is enabled.

'-'
     Breakpoint is disabled.

   The source, assembly and register windows are updated when the
current thread changes, when the frame changes, or when the program
counter changes.

   These windows are not all visible at the same time.  The command
window is always visible.  The others can be arranged in several
layouts:

   * source only,

   * assembly only,

   * source and assembly,

   * source and registers, or

   * assembly and registers.

   A status line above the command window shows the following
information:

_target_
     Indicates the current GDB target.  (*note Specifying a Debugging
     Target: Targets.).

_process_
     Gives the current process or thread number.  When no process is
     being debugged, this field is set to 'No process'.

_function_
     Gives the current function name for the selected frame.  The name
     is demangled if demangling is turned on (*note Print Settings::).
     When there is no symbol corresponding to the current program
     counter, the string '??' is displayed.

_line_
     Indicates the current line number for the selected frame.  When the
     current line number is not known, the string '??' is displayed.

_pc_
     Indicates the current program counter address.

25.2 TUI Key Bindings
=====================

The TUI installs several key bindings in the readline keymaps (*note
Command Line Editing::).  The following key bindings are installed for
both TUI mode and the GDB standard mode.

'C-x C-a'
'C-x a'
'C-x A'
     Enter or leave the TUI mode.  When leaving the TUI mode, the curses
     window management stops and GDB operates using its standard mode,
     writing on the terminal directly.  When reentering the TUI mode,
     control is given back to the curses windows.  The screen is then
     refreshed.

'C-x 1'
     Use a TUI layout with only one window.  The layout will either be
     'source' or 'assembly'.  When the TUI mode is not active, it will
     switch to the TUI mode.

     Think of this key binding as the Emacs 'C-x 1' binding.

'C-x 2'
     Use a TUI layout with at least two windows.  When the current
     layout already has two windows, the next layout with two windows is
     used.  When a new layout is chosen, one window will always be
     common to the previous layout and the new one.

     Think of it as the Emacs 'C-x 2' binding.

'C-x o'
     Change the active window.  The TUI associates several key bindings
     (like scrolling and arrow keys) with the active window.  This
     command gives the focus to the next TUI window.

     Think of it as the Emacs 'C-x o' binding.

'C-x s'
     Switch in and out of the TUI SingleKey mode that binds single keys
     to GDB commands (*note TUI Single Key Mode::).

   The following key bindings only work in the TUI mode:

<PgUp>
     Scroll the active window one page up.

<PgDn>
     Scroll the active window one page down.

<Up>
     Scroll the active window one line up.

<Down>
     Scroll the active window one line down.

<Left>
     Scroll the active window one column left.

<Right>
     Scroll the active window one column right.

'C-L'
     Refresh the screen.

   Because the arrow keys scroll the active window in the TUI mode, they
are not available for their normal use by readline unless the command
window has the focus.  When another window is active, you must use other
readline key bindings such as 'C-p', 'C-n', 'C-b' and 'C-f' to control
the command window.


File: gdb.info,  Node: TUI Single Key Mode,  Next: TUI Commands,  Prev: TUI Keys,  Up: TUI

25.3 TUI Single Key Mode
========================

The TUI also provides a "SingleKey" mode, which binds several frequently
used GDB commands to single keys.  Type 'C-x s' to switch into this
mode, where the following key bindings are used:

'c'
     continue

'd'
     down

'f'
     finish

'n'
     next

'q'
     exit the SingleKey mode.

'r'
     run

's'
     step

'u'
     up

'v'
     info locals

'w'
     where

   Other keys temporarily switch to the GDB command prompt.  The key
that was pressed is inserted in the editing buffer so that it is
possible to type most GDB commands without interaction with the TUI
SingleKey mode.  Once the command is entered the TUI SingleKey mode is
restored.  The only way to permanently leave this mode is by typing 'q'
or 'C-x s'.


File: gdb.info,  Node: TUI Commands,  Next: TUI Configuration,  Prev: TUI Single Key Mode,  Up: TUI

25.4 TUI-specific Commands
==========================

The TUI has specific commands to control the text windows.  These
commands are always available, even when GDB is not in the TUI mode.
When GDB is in the standard mode, most of these commands will
automatically switch to the TUI mode.

   Note that if GDB's 'stdout' is not connected to a terminal, or GDB
has been started with the machine interface interpreter (*note The
GDB/MI Interface: GDB/MI.), most of these commands will fail with an
error, because it would not be possible or desirable to enable curses
window management.

'info win'
     List and give the size of all displayed windows.

'layout next'
     Display the next layout.

'layout prev'
     Display the previous layout.

'layout src'
     Display the source window only.

'layout asm'
     Display the assembly window only.

'layout split'
     Display the source and assembly window.

'layout regs'
     Display the register window together with the source or assembly
     window.

'focus next'
     Make the next window active for scrolling.

'focus prev'
     Make the previous window active for scrolling.

'focus src'
     Make the source window active for scrolling.

'focus asm'
     Make the assembly window active for scrolling.

'focus regs'
     Make the register window active for scrolling.

'focus cmd'
     Make the command window active for scrolling.

'refresh'
     Refresh the screen.  This is similar to typing 'C-L'.

'tui reg float'
     Show the floating point registers in the register window.

'tui reg general'
     Show the general registers in the register window.

'tui reg next'
     Show the next register group.  The list of register groups as well
     as their order is target specific.  The predefined register groups
     are the following: 'general', 'float', 'system', 'vector', 'all',
     'save', 'restore'.

'tui reg system'
     Show the system registers in the register window.

'update'
     Update the source window and the current execution point.

'winheight NAME +COUNT'
'winheight NAME -COUNT'
     Change the height of the window NAME by COUNT lines.  Positive
     counts increase the height, while negative counts decrease it.

'tabset NCHARS'
     Set the width of tab stops to be NCHARS characters.

25.5 TUI Configuration Variables
================================

Several configuration variables control the appearance of TUI windows.

'set tui border-kind KIND'
     Select the border appearance for the source, assembly and register
     windows.  The possible values are the following:
     'space'
          Use a space character to draw the border.

     'ascii'
          Use ASCII characters '+', '-' and '|' to draw the border.

     'acs'
          Use the Alternate Character Set to draw the border.  The
          border is drawn using character line graphics if the terminal
          supports them.

'set tui border-mode MODE'
'set tui active-border-mode MODE'
     Select the display attributes for the borders of the inactive
     windows or the active window.  The MODE can be one of the
     following:
     'normal'
          Use normal attributes to display the border.

     'standout'
          Use standout mode.

     'reverse'
          Use reverse video mode.

     'half'
          Use half bright mode.

     'half-standout'
          Use half bright and standout mode.

     'bold'
          Use extra bright or bold mode.

     'bold-standout'
          Use extra bright or bold and standout mode.

26 Using GDB under GNU Emacs
****************************

A special interface allows you to use GNU Emacs to view (and edit) the
source files for the program you are debugging with GDB.

   To use this interface, use the command 'M-x gdb' in Emacs.  Give the
executable file you want to debug as an argument.  This command starts
GDB as a subprocess of Emacs, with input and output through a newly
created Emacs buffer.

   Running GDB under Emacs can be just like running GDB normally except
for two things:

   * All "terminal" input and output goes through an Emacs buffer,
     called the GUD buffer.

     This applies both to GDB commands and their output, and to the
     input and output done by the program you are debugging.

     This is useful because it means that you can copy the text of
     previous commands and input them again; you can even use parts of
     the output in this way.

     All the facilities of Emacs' Shell mode are available for
     interacting with your program.  In particular, you can send signals
     the usual way--for example, 'C-c C-c' for an interrupt, 'C-c C-z'
     for a stop.

   * GDB displays source code through Emacs.

     Each time GDB displays a stack frame, Emacs automatically finds the
     source file for that frame and puts an arrow ('=>') at the left
     margin of the current line.  Emacs uses a separate buffer for
     source display, and splits the screen to show both your GDB session
     and the source.

     Explicit GDB 'list' or search commands still produce output as
     usual, but you probably have no reason to use them from Emacs.

   We call this "text command mode".  Emacs 22.1, and later, also uses a
graphical mode, enabled by default, which provides further buffers that
can control the execution and describe the state of your program.  *Note
(Emacs)GDB Graphical Interface::.

   If you specify an absolute file name when prompted for the 'M-x gdb'
argument, then Emacs sets your current working directory to where your
program resides.  If you only specify the file name, then Emacs sets
your current working directory to the directory associated with the
previous buffer.  In this case, GDB may find your program by searching
your environment's 'PATH' variable, but on some operating systems it
might not find the source.  So, although the GDB input and output
session proceeds normally, the auxiliary buffer does not display the
current source and line of execution.

   The initial working directory of GDB is printed on the top line of
the GUD buffer and this serves as a default for the commands that
specify files for GDB to operate on.  *Note Commands to Specify Files:
Files.

   By default, 'M-x gdb' calls the program called 'gdb'.  If you need to
call GDB by a different name (for example, if you keep several
configurations around, with different names) you can customize the Emacs
variable 'gud-gdb-command-name' to run the one you want.

   In the GUD buffer, you can use these special Emacs commands in
addition to the standard Shell mode commands:

'C-h m'
     Describe the features of Emacs' GUD Mode.

'C-c C-s'
     Execute to another source line, like the GDB 'step' command; also
     update the display window to show the current file and location.

'C-c C-n'
     Execute to next source line in this function, skipping all function
     calls, like the GDB 'next' command.  Then update the display window
     to show the current file and location.

'C-c C-i'
     Execute one instruction, like the GDB 'stepi' command; update
     display window accordingly.

'C-c C-f'
     Execute until exit from the selected stack frame, like the GDB
     'finish' command.

'C-c C-r'
     Continue execution of your program, like the GDB 'continue'
     command.

'C-c <'
     Go up the number of frames indicated by the numeric argument (*note
     Numeric Arguments: (Emacs)Arguments.), like the GDB 'up' command.

'C-c >'
     Go down the number of frames indicated by the numeric argument,
     like the GDB 'down' command.

   In any source file, the Emacs command 'C-x <SPC>' ('gud-break') tells
GDB to set a breakpoint on the source line point is on.

   In text command mode, if you type 'M-x speedbar', Emacs displays a
separate frame which shows a backtrace when the GUD buffer is current.
Move point to any frame in the stack and type <RET> to make it become
the current frame and display the associated source in the source
buffer.  Alternatively, click 'Mouse-2' to make the selected frame
become the current one.  In graphical mode, the speedbar displays watch
expressions.

   If you accidentally delete the source-display buffer, an easy way to
get it back is to type the command 'f' in the GDB buffer, to request a
frame display; when you run under Emacs, this recreates the source
buffer if necessary to show you the context of the current frame.

   The source files displayed in Emacs are in ordinary Emacs buffers
which are visiting the source files in the usual way.  You can edit the
files with these buffers if you wish; but keep in mind that GDB
communicates with Emacs in terms of line numbers.  If you add or delete
lines from the text, the line numbers that GDB knows cease to correspond
properly with the code.

   A more detailed description of Emacs' interaction with GDB is given
in the Emacs manual (*note (Emacs)Debuggers::).

27 The GDB/MI Interface
***********************

Function and Purpose
====================

GDB/MI is a line based machine oriented text interface to GDB and is
activated by specifying using the '--interpreter' command line option
(*note Mode Options::).  It is specifically intended to support the
development of systems which use the debugger as just one small
component of a larger system.

   This chapter is a specification of the GDB/MI interface.  It is
written in the form of a reference manual.

   Note that GDB/MI is still under construction, so some of the features
described below are incomplete and subject to change (*note GDB/MI
Development and Front Ends: GDB/MI Development and Front Ends.).

Notation and Terminology
========================

This chapter uses the following notation:

   * '|' separates two alternatives.

   * '[ SOMETHING ]' indicates that SOMETHING is optional: it may or may
     not be given.

   * '( GROUP )*' means that GROUP inside the parentheses may repeat
     zero or more times.

   * '( GROUP )+' means that GROUP inside the parentheses may repeat one
     or more times.

   * '"STRING"' means a literal STRING.

27.1 GDB/MI General Design
==========================

Interaction of a GDB/MI frontend with GDB involves three parts--commands
sent to GDB, responses to those commands and notifications.  Each
command results in exactly one response, indicating either successful
completion of the command, or an error.  For the commands that do not
resume the target, the response contains the requested information.  For
the commands that resume the target, the response only indicates whether
the target was successfully resumed.  Notifications is the mechanism for
reporting changes in the state of the target, or in GDB state, that
cannot conveniently be associated with a command and reported as part of
that command response.

   The important examples of notifications are:

   * Exec notifications.  These are used to report changes in target
     state--when a target is resumed, or stopped.  It would not be
     feasible to include this information in response of resuming
     commands, because one resume commands can result in multiple events
     in different threads.  Also, quite some time may pass before any
     event happens in the target, while a frontend needs to know whether
     the resuming command itself was successfully executed.

   * Console output, and status notifications.  Console output
     notifications are used to report output of CLI commands, as well as
     diagnostics for other commands.  Status notifications are used to
     report the progress of a long-running operation.  Naturally,
     including this information in command response would mean no output
     is produced until the command is finished, which is undesirable.

   * General notifications.  Commands may have various side effects on
     the GDB or target state beyond their official purpose.  For
     example, a command may change the selected thread.  Although such
     changes can be included in command response, using notification
     allows for more orthogonal frontend design.

   There's no guarantee that whenever an MI command reports an error,
GDB or the target are in any specific state, and especially, the state
is not reverted to the state before the MI command was processed.
Therefore, whenever an MI command results in an error, we recommend that
the frontend refreshes all the information shown in the user interface.

File: gdb.info,  Node: Context management,  Next: Asynchronous and non-stop modes,  Up: GDB/MI General Design

27.1.1 Context management
-------------------------

27.1.1.1 Threads and Frames
...........................

In most cases when GDB accesses the target, this access is done in
context of a specific thread and frame (*note Frames::).  Often, even
when accessing global data, the target requires that a thread be
specified.  The CLI interface maintains the selected thread and frame,
and supplies them to target on each command.  This is convenient,
because a command line user would not want to specify that information
explicitly on each command, and because user interacts with GDB via a
single terminal, so no confusion is possible as to what thread and frame
are the current ones.

   In the case of MI, the concept of selected thread and frame is less
useful.  First, a frontend can easily remember this information itself.
Second, a graphical frontend can have more than one window, each one
used for debugging a different thread, and the frontend might want to
access additional threads for internal purposes.  This increases the
risk that by relying on implicitly selected thread, the frontend may be
operating on a wrong one.  Therefore, each MI command should explicitly
specify which thread and frame to operate on.  To make it possible, each
MI command accepts the '--thread' and '--frame' options, the value to
each is GDB identifier for thread and frame to operate on.

   Usually, each top-level window in a frontend allows the user to
select a thread and a frame, and remembers the user selection for
further operations.  However, in some cases GDB may suggest that the
current thread be changed.  For example, when stopping on a breakpoint
it is reasonable to switch to the thread where breakpoint is hit.  For
another example, if the user issues the CLI 'thread' command via the
frontend, it is desirable to change the frontend's selected thread to
the one specified by user.  GDB communicates the suggestion to change
current thread using the '=thread-selected' notification.  No such
notification is available for the selected frame at the moment.

   Note that historically, MI shares the selected thread with CLI, so
frontends used the '-thread-select' to execute commands in the right
context.  However, getting this to work right is cumbersome.  The
simplest way is for frontend to emit '-thread-select' command before
every command.  This doubles the number of commands that need to be
sent.  The alternative approach is to suppress '-thread-select' if the
selected thread in GDB is supposed to be identical to the thread the
frontend wants to operate on.  However, getting this optimization right
can be tricky.  In particular, if the frontend sends several commands to
GDB, and one of the commands changes the selected thread, then the
behaviour of subsequent commands will change.  So, a frontend should
either wait for response from such problematic commands, or explicitly
add '-thread-select' for all subsequent commands.  No frontend is known
to do this exactly right, so it is suggested to just always pass the
'--thread' and '--frame' options.

27.1.1.2 Language
.................

The execution of several commands depends on which language is selected.
By default, the current language (*note show language::) is used.  But
for commands known to be language-sensitive, it is recommended to use
the '--language' option.  This option takes one argument, which is the
name of the language to use while executing the command.  For instance:

     -data-evaluate-expression --language c "sizeof (void*)"
     ^done,value="4"
     (gdb)

   The valid language names are the same names accepted by the 'set
language' command (*note Manually::), excluding 'auto', 'local' or
'unknown'.

27.1.2 Asynchronous command execution and non-stop mode
-------------------------------------------------------

On some targets, GDB is capable of processing MI commands even while the
target is running.  This is called "asynchronous command execution"
(*note Background Execution::).  The frontend may specify a preferrence
for asynchronous execution using the '-gdb-set target-async 1' command,
which should be emitted before either running the executable or
attaching to the target.  After the frontend has started the executable
or attached to the target, it can find if asynchronous execution is
enabled using the '-list-target-features' command.

   Even if GDB can accept a command while target is running, many
commands that access the target do not work when the target is running.
Therefore, asynchronous command execution is most useful when combined
with non-stop mode (*note Non-Stop Mode::).  Then, it is possible to
examine the state of one thread, while other threads are running.

   When a given thread is running, MI commands that try to access the
target in the context of that thread may not work, or may work only on
some targets.  In particular, commands that try to operate on thread's
stack will not work, on any target.  Commands that read memory, or
modify breakpoints, may work or not work, depending on the target.  Note
that even commands that operate on global state, such as 'print', 'set',
and breakpoint commands, still access the target in the context of a
specific thread, so frontend should try to find a stopped thread and
perform the operation on that thread (using the '--thread' option).

   Which commands will work in the context of a running thread is highly
target dependent.  However, the two commands '-exec-interrupt', to stop
a thread, and '-thread-info', to find the state of a thread, will always
work.

27.1.3 Thread groups
--------------------

GDB may be used to debug several processes at the same time.  On some
platfroms, GDB may support debugging of several hardware systems, each
one having several cores with several different processes running on
each core.  This section describes the MI mechanism to support such
debugging scenarios.

   The key observation is that regardless of the structure of the
target, MI can have a global list of threads, because most commands that
accept the '--thread' option do not need to know what process that
thread belongs to.  Therefore, it is not necessary to introduce neither
additional '--process' option, nor an notion of the current process in
the MI interface.  The only strictly new feature that is required is the
ability to find how the threads are grouped into processes.

   To allow the user to discover such grouping, and to support arbitrary
hierarchy of machines/cores/processes, MI introduces the concept of a
"thread group".  Thread group is a collection of threads and other
thread groups.  A thread group always has a string identifier, a type,
and may have additional attributes specific to the type.  A new command,
'-list-thread-groups', returns the list of top-level thread groups,
which correspond to processes that GDB is debugging at the moment.  By
passing an identifier of a thread group to the '-list-thread-groups'
command, it is possible to obtain the members of specific thread group.

   To allow the user to easily discover processes, and other objects, he
wishes to debug, a concept of "available thread group" is introduced.
Available thread group is an thread group that GDB is not debugging, but
that can be attached to, using the '-target-attach' command.  The list
of available top-level thread groups can be obtained using
'-list-thread-groups --available'.  In general, the content of a thread
group may be only retrieved only after attaching to that thread group.

   Thread groups are related to inferiors (*note Inferiors and
Programs::).  Each inferior corresponds to a thread group of a special
type 'process', and some additional operations are permitted on such
thread groups.

Notes:

   * The CLI commands are still handled by the MI interpreter; their
     output is described below.

   * The 'TOKEN', when present, is passed back when the command
     finishes.

   * Some MI commands accept optional arguments as part of the parameter
     list.  Each option is identified by a leading '-' (dash) and may be
     followed by an optional argument parameter.  Options occur first in
     the parameter list and can be delimited from normal parameters
     using '--' (this is useful when some parameters begin with a dash).

   Pragmatics:

   * We want easy access to the existing CLI syntax (for debugging).

   * We want it to be easy to spot a MI operation.

followed, optionally, by a single result record.  This result record is

terminated by '(gdb)'.

   If an input command was prefixed with a 'TOKEN' then the

Notes:

   * All output sequences end in a single line containing a period.

   * The 'TOKEN' is from the corresponding request.  Note that for all
     async output, while the token is allowed by the grammar and may be
     output by future versions of GDB for select async output messages,
     it is generally omitted.  Frontends should treat all async output
     as reporting general changes in the state of the target and there
     should be no need to associate async output to any prior command.

   * STATUS-ASYNC-OUTPUT contains on-going status information about the
     progress of a slow operation.  It can be discarded.  All status
     output is prefixed by '+'.

   * EXEC-ASYNC-OUTPUT contains asynchronous state change on the target
     (stopped, started, disappeared).  All async output is prefixed by
     '*'.

   * NOTIFY-ASYNC-OUTPUT contains supplementary information that the
     client should handle (e.g., a new breakpoint information).  All
     notify output is prefixed by '='.

   * CONSOLE-STREAM-OUTPUT is output that should be displayed as is in
     the console.  It is the textual response to a CLI command.  All the
     console output is prefixed by '~'.

   * TARGET-STREAM-OUTPUT is the output produced by the target program.
     All the target output is prefixed by '@'.

   * LOG-STREAM-OUTPUT is output text coming from GDB's internals, for
     instance messages that should be displayed as part of an error log.
     All the log output is prefixed by '&'.

   * New GDB/MI commands should only output LISTS containing VALUES.

27.3 GDB/MI Compatibility with CLI
==================================

For the developers convenience CLI commands can be entered directly, but
there may be some unexpected behaviour.  For example, commands that
query the user will behave as if the user replied yes, breakpoint
command lists are not executed and some CLI commands, such as 'if',
'when' and 'define', prompt for further input with '>', which is not
valid MI output.

   This feature may be removed at some stage in the future and it is
recommended that front ends use the '-interpreter-exec' command (*note
-interpreter-exec::).

27.4 GDB/MI Development and Front Ends
======================================

The application which takes the MI output and presents the state of the
program being debugged to the user is called a "front end".

   Although GDB/MI is still incomplete, it is currently being used by a
variety of front ends to GDB.  This makes it difficult to introduce new
functionality without breaking existing usage.  This section tries to
minimize the problems by describing how the protocol might change.

   Some changes in MI need not break a carefully designed front end, and
for these the MI version will remain unchanged.  The following is a list
of changes that may occur within one level, so front ends should parse
MI output in a way that can handle them:

   * New MI commands may be added.

   * New fields may be added to the output of any MI command.

   * The range of values for fields with specified values, e.g.,
     'in_scope' (*note -var-update::) may be extended.

   If the changes are likely to break front ends, the MI version level
will be increased by one.  This will allow the front end to parse the
output according to the MI version.  Apart from mi0, new versions of GDB
will not support old versions of MI and it will be the responsibility of
the front end to work with the new one.

   The best way to avoid unexpected changes in MI that might break your
front end is to make your project known to GDB developers and follow
development on <gdb@sourceware.org> and <gdb-patches@sourceware.org>.

27.5.1 GDB/MI Result Records
----------------------------

In addition to a number of out-of-band notifications, the response to a
GDB/MI command includes one of the following result indications:

'"^done" [ "," RESULTS ]'
     The synchronous operation was successful, 'RESULTS' are the return
     values.

'"^running"'
     This result record is equivalent to '^done'.  Historically, it was
     output instead of '^done' if the command has resumed the target.
     This behaviour is maintained for backward compatibility, but all
     frontends should treat '^done' and '^running' identically and rely
     on the '*running' output record to determine which threads are
     resumed.

'"^connected"'
     GDB has connected to a remote target.

'"^error" "," "msg=" C-STRING [ "," "code=" C-STRING ]'
     The operation failed.  The 'msg=C-STRING' variable contains the
     corresponding error message.

     If present, the 'code=C-STRING' variable provides an error code on
     which consumers can rely on to detect the corresponding error
     condition.  At present, only one error code is defined:

     '"undefined-command"'
          Indicates that the command causing the error does not exist.

'"^exit"'
     GDB has terminated.

27.5.2 GDB/MI Stream Records
----------------------------

GDB internally maintains a number of output streams: the console, the
target, and the log.  The output intended for each of these streams is
funneled through the GDB/MI interface using "stream records".

   Each stream record begins with a unique "prefix character" which
identifies its stream (*note GDB/MI Output Syntax: GDB/MI Output
Syntax.).  In addition to the prefix, each stream record contains a
'STRING-OUTPUT'.  This is either raw text (with an implicit new line) or
a quoted C string (which does not contain an implicit newline).

'"~" STRING-OUTPUT'
     The console output stream contains text that should be displayed in
     the CLI console window.  It contains the textual responses to CLI
     commands.

'"@" STRING-OUTPUT'
     The target output stream contains any textual output from the
     running target.  This is only present when GDB's event loop is
     truly asynchronous, which is currently only the case for remote
     targets.

'"&" STRING-OUTPUT'
     The log stream contains debugging messages being produced by GDB's
     internals.

27.5.3 GDB/MI Async Records
---------------------------

"Async" records are used to notify the GDB/MI client of additional
changes that have occurred.  Those changes can either be a consequence
of GDB/MI commands (e.g., a breakpoint modified) or a result of target
activity (e.g., target stopped).

   The following is the list of possible async records:

'*running,thread-id="THREAD"'
     The target is now running.  The THREAD field tells which specific
     thread is now running, and can be 'all' if all threads are running.
     The frontend should assume that no interaction with a running
     thread is possible after this notification is produced.  The
     frontend should not assume that this notification is output only
     once for any command.  GDB may emit this notification several
     times, either for different threads, because it cannot resume all
     threads together, or even for a single thread, if the thread must
     be stepped though some code before letting it run freely.

'*stopped,reason="REASON",thread-id="ID",stopped-threads="STOPPED",core="CORE"'
     The target has stopped.  The REASON field can have one of the
     following values:

     'breakpoint-hit'
          A breakpoint was reached.
     'watchpoint-trigger'
          A watchpoint was triggered.
     'read-watchpoint-trigger'
          A read watchpoint was triggered.
     'access-watchpoint-trigger'
          An access watchpoint was triggered.
     'function-finished'
          An -exec-finish or similar CLI command was accomplished.
     'location-reached'
          An -exec-until or similar CLI command was accomplished.
     'watchpoint-scope'
          A watchpoint has gone out of scope.
     'end-stepping-range'
          An -exec-next, -exec-next-instruction, -exec-step,
          -exec-step-instruction or similar CLI command was
          accomplished.
     'exited-signalled'
          The inferior exited because of a signal.
     'exited'
          The inferior exited.
     'exited-normally'
          The inferior exited normally.
     'signal-received'
          A signal was received by the inferior.
     'solib-event'
          The inferior has stopped due to a library being loaded or
          unloaded.  This can happen when 'stop-on-solib-events' (*note
          Files::) is set or when a 'catch load' or 'catch unload'
          catchpoint is in use (*note Set Catchpoints::).
     'fork'
          The inferior has forked.  This is reported when 'catch fork'
          (*note Set Catchpoints::) has been used.
     'vfork'
          The inferior has vforked.  This is reported in when 'catch
          vfork' (*note Set Catchpoints::) has been used.
     'syscall-entry'
          The inferior entered a system call.  This is reported when
          'catch syscall' (*note Set Catchpoints::) has been used.
     'syscall-entry'
          The inferior returned from a system call.  This is reported
          when 'catch syscall' (*note Set Catchpoints::) has been used.
     'exec'
          The inferior called 'exec'.  This is reported when 'catch
          exec' (*note Set Catchpoints::) has been used.

     The ID field identifies the thread that directly caused the stop -
     for example by hitting a breakpoint.  Depending on whether all-stop
     mode is in effect (*note All-Stop Mode::), GDB may either stop all
     threads, or only the thread that directly triggered the stop.  If
     all threads are stopped, the STOPPED field will have the value of
     '"all"'.  Otherwise, the value of the STOPPED field will be a list
     of thread identifiers.  Presently, this list will always include a
     single thread, but frontend should be prepared to see several
     threads in the list.  The CORE field reports the processor core on
     which the stop event has happened.  This field may be absent if
     such information is not available.

'=thread-group-added,id="ID"'
'=thread-group-removed,id="ID"'
     A thread group was either added or removed.  The ID field contains
     the GDB identifier of the thread group.  When a thread group is
     added, it generally might not be associated with a running process.
     When a thread group is removed, its id becomes invalid and cannot
     be used in any way.

'=thread-group-started,id="ID",pid="PID"'
     A thread group became associated with a running program, either
     because the program was just started or the thread group was
     attached to a program.  The ID field contains the GDB identifier of
     the thread group.  The PID field contains process identifier,
     specific to the operating system.

'=thread-group-exited,id="ID"[,exit-code="CODE"]'
     A thread group is no longer associated with a running program,
     either because the program has exited, or because it was detached
     from.  The ID field contains the GDB identifier of the thread
     group.  CODE is the exit code of the inferior; it exists only when
     the inferior exited with some code.

'=thread-created,id="ID",group-id="GID"'
'=thread-exited,id="ID",group-id="GID"'
     A thread either was created, or has exited.  The ID field contains
     the GDB identifier of the thread.  The GID field identifies the
     thread group this thread belongs to.

'=thread-selected,id="ID"'
     Informs that the selected thread was changed as result of the last
     command.  This notification is not emitted as result of
     '-thread-select' command but is emitted whenever an MI command that
     is not documented to change the selected thread actually changes
     it.  In particular, invoking, directly or indirectly (via
     user-defined command), the CLI 'thread' command, will generate this
     notification.

     We suggest that in response to this notification, front ends
     highlight the selected thread and cause subsequent commands to
     apply to that thread.

'=library-loaded,...'
     Reports that a new library file was loaded by the program.  This
     notification has 4 fields--ID, TARGET-NAME, HOST-NAME, and
     SYMBOLS-LOADED.  The ID field is an opaque identifier of the
     library.  For remote debugging case, TARGET-NAME and HOST-NAME
     fields give the name of the library file on the target, and on the
     host respectively.  For native debugging, both those fields have
     the same value.  The SYMBOLS-LOADED field is emitted only for
     backward compatibility and should not be relied on to convey any
     useful information.  The THREAD-GROUP field, if present, specifies
     the id of the thread group in whose context the library was loaded.
     If the field is absent, it means the library was loaded in the
     context of all present thread groups.

'=library-unloaded,...'
     Reports that a library was unloaded by the program.  This
     notification has 3 fields--ID, TARGET-NAME and HOST-NAME with the
     same meaning as for the '=library-loaded' notification.  The
     THREAD-GROUP field, if present, specifies the id of the thread
     group in whose context the library was unloaded.  If the field is
     absent, it means the library was unloaded in the context of all
     present thread groups.

'=traceframe-changed,num=TFNUM,tracepoint=TPNUM'
'=traceframe-changed,end'
     Reports that the trace frame was changed and its new number is
     TFNUM.  The number of the tracepoint associated with this trace
     frame is TPNUM.

'=tsv-created,name=NAME,initial=INITIAL'
     Reports that the new trace state variable NAME is created with
     initial value INITIAL.

'=tsv-deleted,name=NAME'
'=tsv-deleted'
     Reports that the trace state variable NAME is deleted or all trace
     state variables are deleted.

'=tsv-modified,name=NAME,initial=INITIAL[,current=CURRENT]'
     Reports that the trace state variable NAME is modified with the
     initial value INITIAL.  The current value CURRENT of trace state
     variable is optional and is reported if the current value of trace
     state variable is known.

'=breakpoint-created,bkpt={...}'
'=breakpoint-modified,bkpt={...}'
'=breakpoint-deleted,id=NUMBER'
     Reports that a breakpoint was created, modified, or deleted,
     respectively.  Only user-visible breakpoints are reported to the MI
     user.

     The BKPT argument is of the same form as returned by the various
     breakpoint commands; *Note GDB/MI Breakpoint Commands::.  The
     NUMBER is the ordinal number of the breakpoint.

     Note that if a breakpoint is emitted in the result record of a
     command, then it will not also be emitted in an async record.

'=record-started,thread-group="ID"'
'=record-stopped,thread-group="ID"'
     Execution log recording was either started or stopped on an
     inferior.  The ID is the GDB identifier of the thread group
     corresponding to the affected inferior.

'=cmd-param-changed,param=PARAM,value=VALUE'
     Reports that a parameter of the command 'set PARAM' is changed to
     VALUE.  In the multi-word 'set' command, the PARAM is the whole
     parameter list to 'set' command.  For example, In command 'set
     check type on', PARAM is 'check type' and VALUE is 'on'.

'=memory-changed,thread-group=ID,addr=ADDR,len=LEN[,type="code"]'
     Reports that bytes from ADDR to DATA + LEN were written in an
     inferior.  The ID is the identifier of the thread group
     corresponding to the affected inferior.  The optional 'type="code"'
     part is reported if the memory written to holds executable code.

27.5.4 GDB/MI Breakpoint Information
------------------------------------

When GDB reports information about a breakpoint, a tracepoint, a
watchpoint, or a catchpoint, it uses a tuple with the following fields:

'number'
     The breakpoint number.  For a breakpoint that represents one
     location of a multi-location breakpoint, this will be a dotted
     pair, like '1.2'.

'type'
     The type of the breakpoint.  For ordinary breakpoints this will be
     'breakpoint', but many values are possible.

'catch-type'
     If the type of the breakpoint is 'catchpoint', then this indicates
     the exact type of catchpoint.

'disp'
     This is the breakpoint disposition--either 'del', meaning that the
     breakpoint will be deleted at the next stop, or 'keep', meaning
     that the breakpoint will not be deleted.

'enabled'
     This indicates whether the breakpoint is enabled, in which case the
     value is 'y', or disabled, in which case the value is 'n'.  Note
     that this is not the same as the field 'enable'.

'addr'
     The address of the breakpoint.  This may be a hexidecimal number,
     giving the address; or the string '<PENDING>', for a pending
     breakpoint; or the string '<MULTIPLE>', for a breakpoint with
     multiple locations.  This field will not be present if no address
     can be determined.  For example, a watchpoint does not have an
     address.

'func'
     If known, the function in which the breakpoint appears.  If not
     known, this field is not present.

'filename'
     The name of the source file which contains this function, if known.
     If not known, this field is not present.

'fullname'
     The full file name of the source file which contains this function,
     if known.  If not known, this field is not present.

'line'
     The line number at which this breakpoint appears, if known.  If not
     known, this field is not present.

'at'
     If the source file is not known, this field may be provided.  If
     provided, this holds the address of the breakpoint, possibly
     followed by a symbol name.

'pending'
     If this breakpoint is pending, this field is present and holds the
     text used to set the breakpoint, as entered by the user.

'evaluated-by'
     Where this breakpoint's condition is evaluated, either 'host' or
     'target'.

'thread'
     If this is a thread-specific breakpoint, then this identifies the
     thread in which the breakpoint can trigger.

'task'
     If this breakpoint is restricted to a particular Ada task, then
     this field will hold the task identifier.

'cond'
     If the breakpoint is conditional, this is the condition expression.

'ignore'
     The ignore count of the breakpoint.

'enable'
     The enable count of the breakpoint.

'traceframe-usage'
     FIXME.

'static-tracepoint-marker-string-id'
     For a static tracepoint, the name of the static tracepoint marker.

'mask'
     For a masked watchpoint, this is the mask.

'pass'
     A tracepoint's pass count.

'original-location'
     The location of the breakpoint as originally specified by the user.
     This field is optional.

'times'
     The number of times the breakpoint has been hit.

'installed'
     This field is only given for tracepoints.  This is either 'y',
     meaning that the tracepoint is installed, or 'n', meaning that it
     is not.

'what'
     Some extra data, the exact contents of which are type-dependent.

   For example, here is what the output of '-break-insert' (*note GDB/MI
Breakpoint Commands::) might be:

     -> -break-insert main
     <- ^done,bkpt={number="1",type="breakpoint",disp="keep",
         enabled="y",addr="0x08048564",func="main",file="myprog.c",
         fullname="/home/nickrob/myprog.c",line="68",thread-groups=["i1"],
         times="0"}
     <- (gdb)

27.5.5 GDB/MI Frame Information
-------------------------------

Response from many MI commands includes an information about stack
frame.  This information is a tuple that may have the following fields:

'level'
     The level of the stack frame.  The innermost frame has the level of
     zero.  This field is always present.

'func'
     The name of the function corresponding to the frame.  This field
     may be absent if GDB is unable to determine the function name.

'addr'
     The code address for the frame.  This field is always present.

'file'
     The name of the source files that correspond to the frame's code
     address.  This field may be absent.

'line'
     The source line corresponding to the frames' code address.  This
     field may be absent.

'from'
     The name of the binary file (either executable or shared library)
     the corresponds to the frame's code address.  This field may be
     absent.

27.5.6 GDB/MI Thread Information
--------------------------------

Whenever GDB has to report an information about a thread, it uses a
tuple with the following fields:

'id'
     The numeric id assigned to the thread by GDB.  This field is always
     present.

'target-id'
     Target-specific string identifying the thread.  This field is
     always present.

'details'
     Additional information about the thread provided by the target.  It
     is supposed to be human-readable and not interpreted by the
     frontend.  This field is optional.

'state'
     Either 'stopped' or 'running', depending on whether the thread is
     presently running.  This field is always present.

'core'
     The value of this field is an integer number of the processor core
     the thread was last seen on.  This field is optional.

27.5.7 GDB/MI Ada Exception Information
---------------------------------------

Whenever a '*stopped' record is emitted because the program stopped
after hitting an exception catchpoint (*note Set Catchpoints::), GDB
provides the name of the exception that was raised via the
'exception-name' field.

27.6 Simple Examples of GDB/MI Interaction
==========================================

This subsection presents several simple examples of interaction using
the GDB/MI interface.  In these examples, '->' means that the following
line is passed to GDB/MI as input, while '<-' means the output received
from GDB/MI.

   Note the line breaks shown in the examples are here only for
readability, they don't appear in the real output.

Setting a Breakpoint
--------------------

Setting a breakpoint generates synchronous output which contains
detailed information of the breakpoint.

     -> -break-insert main
     <- ^done,bkpt={number="1",type="breakpoint",disp="keep",
         enabled="y",addr="0x08048564",func="main",file="myprog.c",
         fullname="/home/nickrob/myprog.c",line="68",thread-groups=["i1"],
         times="0"}
     <- (gdb)

Program Execution
-----------------

Program execution generates asynchronous records and MI gives the reason
that execution stopped.

     -> -exec-run
     <- ^running
     <- (gdb)
     <- *stopped,reason="breakpoint-hit",disp="keep",bkptno="1",thread-id="0",
        frame={addr="0x08048564",func="main",
        args=[{name="argc",value="1"},{name="argv",value="0xbfc4d4d4"}],
        file="myprog.c",fullname="/home/nickrob/myprog.c",line="68"}
     <- (gdb)
     -> -exec-continue
     <- ^running
     <- (gdb)
     <- *stopped,reason="exited-normally"
     <- (gdb)

Quitting GDB
------------

Quitting GDB just prints the result class '^exit'.

     -> (gdb)
     <- -gdb-exit
     <- ^exit

   Please note that '^exit' is printed immediately, but it might take
some time for GDB to actually exit.  During that time, GDB performs
necessary cleanups, including killing programs being debugged or
disconnecting from debug hardware, so the frontend should wait till GDB
exits and should only forcibly kill GDB if it fails to exit in
reasonable time.

A Bad Command
-------------

Here's what happens if you pass a non-existent command:

     -> -rubbish
     <- ^error,msg="Undefined MI command: rubbish"
     <- (gdb)

27.8 GDB/MI Breakpoint Commands
===============================

This section documents GDB/MI commands for manipulating breakpoints.

The '-break-after' Command
--------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -break-after NUMBER COUNT

   The breakpoint number NUMBER is not in effect until it has been hit
COUNT times.  To see how this is reflected in the output of the
'-break-list' command, see the description of the '-break-list' command
below.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'ignore'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -break-insert main
     ^done,bkpt={number="1",type="breakpoint",disp="keep",
     enabled="y",addr="0x000100d0",func="main",file="hello.c",
     fullname="/home/foo/hello.c",line="5",thread-groups=["i1"],
     times="0"}
     (gdb)
     -break-after 1 3
     ~
     ^done
     (gdb)
     -break-list
     ^done,BreakpointTable={nr_rows="1",nr_cols="6",
     hdr=[{width="3",alignment="-1",col_name="number",colhdr="Num"},
     {width="14",alignment="-1",col_name="type",colhdr="Type"},

     line="5",thread-groups=["i1"],times="0",ignore="3"}]}
     (gdb)

The '-break-commands' Command
-----------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -break-commands NUMBER [ COMMAND1 ... COMMANDN ]

   Specifies the CLI commands that should be executed when breakpoint
NUMBER is hit.  The parameters COMMAND1 to COMMANDN are the commands.
If no command is specified, any previously-set commands are cleared.
*Note Break Commands::.  Typical use of this functionality is tracing a
program, that is, printing of values of some variables whenever
breakpoint is hit and then continuing.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'commands'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -break-insert main
     ^done,bkpt={number="1",type="breakpoint",disp="keep",

     ^done
     (gdb)

The '-break-condition' Command
------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -break-condition NUMBER EXPR

   Breakpoint NUMBER will stop the program only if the condition in EXPR
is true.  The condition becomes part of the '-break-list' output (see
the description of the '-break-list' command below).

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'condition'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -break-condition 1 1

     line="5",cond="1",thread-groups=["i1"],times="0",ignore="3"}]}
     (gdb)

The '-break-delete' Command
---------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -break-delete ( BREAKPOINT )+

   Delete the breakpoint(s) whose number(s) are specified in the
argument list.  This is obviously reflected in the breakpoint list.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'delete'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -break-delete 1
     ^done
     (gdb)
     -break-list
     ^done,BreakpointTable={nr_rows="0",nr_cols="6",
     hdr=[{width="3",alignment="-1",col_name="number",colhdr="Num"},
     {width="14",alignment="-1",col_name="type",colhdr="Type"},
     {width="4",alignment="-1",col_name="disp",colhdr="Disp"},
     {width="3",alignment="-1",col_name="enabled",colhdr="Enb"},
     {width="10",alignment="-1",col_name="addr",colhdr="Address"},
     {width="40",alignment="2",col_name="what",colhdr="What"}],
     body=[]}
     (gdb)

The '-break-disable' Command
----------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -break-disable ( BREAKPOINT )+

   Disable the named BREAKPOINT(s).  The field 'enabled' in the break
list is now set to 'n' for the named BREAKPOINT(s).

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'disable'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -break-disable 2
     ^done
     (gdb)
     -break-list
     ^done,BreakpointTable={nr_rows="1",nr_cols="6",

The '-break-passcount' Command
------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -break-passcount TRACEPOINT-NUMBER PASSCOUNT

   Set the passcount for tracepoint TRACEPOINT-NUMBER to PASSCOUNT.  If
the breakpoint referred to by TRACEPOINT-NUMBER is not a tracepoint,
error is emitted.  This corresponds to CLI command 'passcount'.

The '-break-watch' Command
--------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -break-watch [ -a | -r ]

   Create a watchpoint.  With the '-a' option it will create an "access"
watchpoint, i.e., a watchpoint that triggers either on a read from or on
a write to the memory location.  With the '-r' option, the watchpoint
created is a "read" watchpoint, i.e., it will trigger only when the
memory location is accessed for reading.  Without either of the options,
the watchpoint created is a regular watchpoint, i.e., it will trigger
when the memory location is accessed for writing.  *Note Setting
Watchpoints: Set Watchpoints.

   Note that '-break-list' will report a single list of watchpoints and
breakpoints inserted.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB commands are 'watch', 'awatch', and 'rwatch'.

Example
.......

Setting a watchpoint on a variable in the 'main' function:

     (gdb)
     -break-watch x
     ^done,wpt={number="2",exp="x"}
     (gdb)
     -exec-continue
     ^running
     (gdb)
     *stopped,reason="watchpoint-trigger",wpt={number="2",exp="x"},
     value={old="-268439212",new="55"},
     frame={func="main",args=[],file="recursive2.c",
     fullname="/home/foo/bar/recursive2.c",line="5"}
     (gdb)

   Setting a watchpoint on a variable local to a function.  GDB will
stop the program execution twice: first for the variable changing value,
then for the watchpoint going out of scope.

     (gdb)
     -break-watch C
     ^done,wpt={number="5",exp="C"}
     (gdb)
     -exec-continue

     (gdb)

   Listing breakpoints and watchpoints, at different points in the
program execution.  Note that once the watchpoint goes out of scope, it
is deleted.

stop the execution when Ada exceptions are being raised.

The '-catch-assert' Command
---------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -catch-assert [ -c CONDITION] [ -d ] [ -t ]

   Add a catchpoint for failed Ada assertions.

   The possible optional parameters for this command are:

'-c CONDITION'
     Make the catchpoint conditional on CONDITION.
'-d'
     Create a disabled catchpoint.
'-t'
     Create a temporary catchpoint.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'catch assert'.

Example
.......

     -catch-assert
     ^done,bkptno="5",bkpt={number="5",type="breakpoint",disp="keep",

The '-catch-exception' Command
------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -catch-exception [ -c CONDITION] [ -d ] [ -e EXCEPTION-NAME ]
         [ -t ] [ -u ]

   Add a catchpoint stopping when Ada exceptions are raised.  By
default, the command stops the program when any Ada exception gets
raised.  But it is also possible, by using some of the optional
parameters described below, to create more selective catchpoints.

   The possible optional parameters for this command are:

'-c CONDITION'
     Make the catchpoint conditional on CONDITION.
'-d'
     Create a disabled catchpoint.
'-e EXCEPTION-NAME'
     Only stop when EXCEPTION-NAME is raised.  This option cannot be
     used combined with '-u'.
'-t'
     Create a temporary catchpoint.
'-u'
     Stop only when an unhandled exception gets raised.  This option
     cannot be used combined with '-e'.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB commands are 'catch exception' and 'catch
exception unhandled'.

Example
.......

The '-environment-directory' Command
------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -environment-directory [ -r ] [ PATHDIR ]+

   Add directories PATHDIR to beginning of search path for source files.
If the '-r' option is used, the search path is reset to the default
search path.  If directories PATHDIR are supplied in addition to the
'-r' option, the search path is first reset and then addition occurs as
normal.  Multiple directories may be specified, separated by blanks.
Specifying multiple directories in a single command results in the
directories added to the beginning of the search path in the same order
they were presented in the command.  If blanks are needed as part of a
directory name, double-quotes should be used around the name.  In the
command output, the path will show up separated by the system
directory-separator character.  The directory-separator character must
not be used in any directory name.  If no directories are specified, the
current search path is displayed.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'dir'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -environment-directory /kwikemart/marge/ezannoni/flathead-dev/devo/gdb
     ^done,source-path="/kwikemart/marge/ezannoni/flathead-dev/devo/gdb:$cdir:$cwd"
     (gdb)
     -environment-directory ""
     ^done,source-path="/kwikemart/marge/ezannoni/flathead-dev/devo/gdb:$cdir:$cwd"

     (gdb)

The '-environment-path' Command
-------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -environment-path [ -r ] [ PATHDIR ]+

   Add directories PATHDIR to beginning of search path for object files.
If the '-r' option is used, the search path is reset to the original
search path that existed at gdb start-up.  If directories PATHDIR are
supplied in addition to the '-r' option, the search path is first reset
and then addition occurs as normal.  Multiple directories may be
specified, separated by blanks.  Specifying multiple directories in a
single command results in the directories added to the beginning of the
search path in the same order they were presented in the command.  If
blanks are needed as part of a directory name, double-quotes should be
used around the name.  In the command output, the path will show up
separated by the system directory-separator character.  The
directory-separator character must not be used in any directory name.
If no directories are specified, the current path is displayed.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'path'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -environment-path
     ^done,path="/usr/bin"
     (gdb)
     -environment-path /kwikemart/marge/ezannoni/flathead-dev/ppc-eabi/gdb /bin
     ^done,path="/kwikemart/marge/ezannoni/flathead-dev/ppc-eabi/gdb:/bin:/usr/bin"
     (gdb)
     -environment-path -r /usr/local/bin
     ^done,path="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin"
     (gdb)

The '-environment-pwd' Command
------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -environment-pwd

   Show the current working directory.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'pwd'.

Example
.......

27.11 GDB/MI Thread Commands
============================

The '-thread-info' Command
--------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -thread-info [ THREAD-ID ]

   Reports information about either a specific thread, if the THREAD-ID
parameter is present, or about all threads.  When printing information
about all threads, also reports the current thread.

GDB Command
...........

The 'info thread' command prints the same information about all threads.

Result
......

The result is a list of threads.  The following attributes are defined
for a given thread:

'current'
     This field exists only for the current thread.  It has the value
     '*'.

'id'
     The identifier that GDB uses to refer to the thread.

'target-id'
     The identifier that the target uses to refer to the thread.

'details'
     Extra information about the thread, in a target-specific format.
     This field is optional.

'name'
     The name of the thread.  If the user specified a name using the
     'thread name' command, then this name is given.  Otherwise, if GDB
     can extract the thread name from the target, then that name is
     given.  If GDB cannot find the thread name, then this field is
     omitted.

'frame'
     The stack frame currently executing in the thread.

'state'
     The thread's state.  The 'state' field may have the following
     values:

     'stopped'
          The thread is stopped.  Frame information is available for
          stopped threads.

     'running'
          The thread is running.  There's no frame information for
          running threads.

'core'
     If GDB can find the CPU core on which this thread is running, then
     this field is the core identifier.  This field is optional.

Example
.......

     -thread-info
     ^done,threads=[
     {id="2",target-id="Thread 0xb7e14b90 (LWP 21257)",
        frame={level="0",addr="0xffffe410",func="__kernel_vsyscall",
                args=[]},state="running"},
     {id="1",target-id="Thread 0xb7e156b0 (LWP 21254)",
        frame={level="0",addr="0x0804891f",func="foo",
                args=[{name="i",value="10"}],
                file="/tmp/a.c",fullname="/tmp/a.c",line="158"},
                state="running"}],
     current-thread-id="1"
     (gdb)

The '-thread-list-ids' Command
------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -thread-list-ids

   Produces a list of the currently known GDB thread ids.  At the end of
the list it also prints the total number of such threads.

   This command is retained for historical reasons, the '-thread-info'
command should be used instead.

GDB Command
...........

Part of 'info threads' supplies the same information.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -thread-list-ids
     ^done,thread-ids={thread-id="3",thread-id="2",thread-id="1"},
     current-thread-id="1",number-of-threads="3"
     (gdb)

The '-thread-select' Command
----------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -thread-select THREADNUM

   Make THREADNUM the current thread.  It prints the number of the new
current thread, and the topmost frame for that thread.

   This command is deprecated in favor of explicitly using the
'--thread' option to each command.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'thread'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -exec-next
     ^running
     (gdb)
     *stopped,reason="end-stepping-range",thread-id="2",line="187",
     file="../../../devo/gdb/testsuite/gdb.threads/linux-dp.c"
     (gdb)
     -thread-list-ids
     ^done,
     thread-ids={thread-id="3",thread-id="2",thread-id="1"},
     number-of-threads="3"
     (gdb)
     -thread-select 3
     ^done,new-thread-id="3",
     frame={level="0",func="vprintf",
     args=[{name="format",value="0x8048e9c \"%*s%c %d %c\\n\""},
     {name="arg",value="0x2"}],file="vprintf.c",line="31"}

27.12 GDB/MI Ada Tasking Commands
=================================

The '-ada-task-info' Command
----------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -ada-task-info [ TASK-ID ]

   Reports information about either a specific Ada task, if the TASK-ID
parameter is present, or about all Ada tasks.

GDB Command
...........

The 'info tasks' command prints the same information about all Ada tasks
(*note Ada Tasks::).

Result
......

The result is a table of Ada tasks.  The following columns are defined
for each Ada task:

'current'
     This field exists only for the current thread.  It has the value
     '*'.

'id'
     The identifier that GDB uses to refer to the Ada task.

'task-id'
     The identifier that the target uses to refer to the Ada task.

'thread-id'
     The identifier of the thread corresponding to the Ada task.

     This field should always exist, as Ada tasks are always implemented
     on top of a thread.  But if GDB cannot find this corresponding
     thread for any reason, the field is omitted.

'parent-id'
     This field exists only when the task was created by another task.
     In this case, it provides the ID of the parent task.

'priority'
     The base priority of the task.

'state'
     The current state of the task.  For a detailed description of the
     possible states, see *note Ada Tasks::.

'name'
     The name of the task.

Example
.......

     -ada-task-info
     ^done,tasks={nr_rows="3",nr_cols="8",
     hdr=[{width="1",alignment="-1",col_name="current",colhdr=""},
     {width="3",alignment="1",col_name="id",colhdr="ID"},
     {width="9",alignment="1",col_name="task-id",colhdr="TID"},
     {width="4",alignment="1",col_name="thread-id",colhdr=""},
     {width="4",alignment="1",col_name="parent-id",colhdr="P-ID"},
     {width="3",alignment="1",col_name="priority",colhdr="Pri"},
     {width="22",alignment="-1",col_name="state",colhdr="State"},
     {width="1",alignment="2",col_name="name",colhdr="Name"}],
     body=[{current="*",id="1",task-id="   644010",thread-id="1",priority="48",
     state="Child Termination Wait",name="main_task"}]}

27.13 GDB/MI Program Execution
==============================

These are the asynchronous commands which generate the out-of-band
record '*stopped'.  Currently GDB only really executes asynchronously
with remote targets and this interaction is mimicked in other cases.

The '-exec-continue' Command
----------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -exec-continue [--reverse] [--all|--thread-group N]

   Resumes the execution of the inferior program, which will continue to
execute until it reaches a debugger stop event.  If the '--reverse'
option is specified, execution resumes in reverse until it reaches a
stop event.  Stop events may include
   * breakpoints or watchpoints
   * signals or exceptions
   * the end of the process (or its beginning under '--reverse')
   * the end or beginning of a replay log if one is being used.
   In all-stop mode (*note All-Stop Mode::), may resume only one thread,
or all threads, depending on the value of the 'scheduler-locking'
variable.  If '--all' is specified, all threads (in all inferiors) will
be resumed.  The '--all' option is ignored in all-stop mode.  If the
'--thread-group' options is specified, then all threads in that thread
group are resumed.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB corresponding is 'continue'.

Example
.......

     -exec-continue
     ^running
     (gdb)
     @Hello world
     *stopped,reason="breakpoint-hit",disp="keep",bkptno="2",frame={
     func="foo",args=[],file="hello.c",fullname="/home/foo/bar/hello.c",
     line="13"}
     (gdb)

The '-exec-finish' Command
--------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -exec-finish [--reverse]

   Resumes the execution of the inferior program until the current
function is exited.  Displays the results returned by the function.  If
the '--reverse' option is specified, resumes the reverse execution of
the inferior program until the point where current function was called.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'finish'.

Example
.......

Function returning 'void'.

     -exec-finish
     ^running
     (gdb)
     @hello from foo
     *stopped,reason="function-finished",frame={func="main",args=[],
     file="hello.c",fullname="/home/foo/bar/hello.c",line="7"}
     (gdb)

   Function returning other than 'void'.  The name of the internal GDB
variable storing the result is printed, together with the value itself.

     -exec-finish
     ^running
     (gdb)
     *stopped,reason="function-finished",frame={addr="0x000107b0",func="foo",
     args=[{name="a",value="1"],{name="b",value="9"}},
     file="recursive2.c",fullname="/home/foo/bar/recursive2.c",line="14"},
     gdb-result-var="$1",return-value="0"
     (gdb)

The '-exec-interrupt' Command
-----------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -exec-interrupt [--all|--thread-group N]

   Interrupts the background execution of the target.  Note how the
token associated with the stop message is the one for the execution
command that has been interrupted.  The token for the interrupt itself
only appears in the '^done' output.  If the user is trying to interrupt
a non-running program, an error message will be printed.

   Note that when asynchronous execution is enabled, this command is
asynchronous just like other execution commands.  That is, first the
'^done' response will be printed, and the target stop will be reported
after that using the '*stopped' notification.

   In non-stop mode, only the context thread is interrupted by default.
All threads (in all inferiors) will be interrupted if the '--all' option
is specified.  If the '--thread-group' option is specified, all threads
in that group will be interrupted.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'interrupt'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     111-exec-continue
     111^running

     (gdb)
     222-exec-interrupt
     222^done
     (gdb)
     111*stopped,signal-name="SIGINT",signal-meaning="Interrupt",
     frame={addr="0x00010140",func="foo",args=[],file="try.c",
     fullname="/home/foo/bar/try.c",line="13"}
     (gdb)

     (gdb)
     -exec-interrupt
     ^error,msg="mi_cmd_exec_interrupt: Inferior not executing."
     (gdb)

The '-exec-jump' Command
------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -exec-jump LOCATION

   Resumes execution of the inferior program at the location specified
by parameter.  *Note Specify Location::, for a description of the
different forms of LOCATION.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'jump'.

Example
.......

     -exec-jump foo.c:10
     *running,thread-id="all"
     ^running

The '-exec-next' Command
------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -exec-next [--reverse]

   Resumes execution of the inferior program, stopping when the
beginning of the next source line is reached.

   If the '--reverse' option is specified, resumes reverse execution of
the inferior program, stopping at the beginning of the previous source
line.  If you issue this command on the first line of a function, it
will take you back to the caller of that function, to the source line
where the function was called.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'next'.

Example
.......

     -exec-next
     ^running
     (gdb)
     *stopped,reason="end-stepping-range",line="8",file="hello.c"
     (gdb)

The '-exec-next-instruction' Command
------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -exec-next-instruction [--reverse]

   Executes one machine instruction.  If the instruction is a function
call, continues until the function returns.  If the program stops at an
instruction in the middle of a source line, the address will be printed
as well.

   If the '--reverse' option is specified, resumes reverse execution of
the inferior program, stopping at the previous instruction.  If the
previously executed instruction was a return from another function, it
will continue to execute in reverse until the call to that function
(from the current stack frame) is reached.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'nexti'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -exec-next-instruction
     ^running

     (gdb)
     *stopped,reason="end-stepping-range",
     addr="0x000100d4",line="5",file="hello.c"
     (gdb)

The '-exec-return' Command
--------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -exec-return

   Makes current function return immediately.  Doesn't execute the
inferior.  Displays the new current frame.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'return'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     200-break-insert callee4
     200^done,bkpt={number="1",addr="0x00010734",
     file="../../../devo/gdb/testsuite/gdb.mi/basics.c",line="8"}
     (gdb)
     000-exec-run
     000^running
     (gdb)
     000*stopped,reason="breakpoint-hit",disp="keep",bkptno="1",
     frame={func="callee4",args=[],
     file="../../../devo/gdb/testsuite/gdb.mi/basics.c",
     fullname="/home/foo/bar/devo/gdb/testsuite/gdb.mi/basics.c",line="8"}
     (gdb)
     205-break-delete
     205^done
     (gdb)
     111-exec-return
     111^done,frame={level="0",func="callee3",
     args=[{name="strarg",
     value="0x11940 \"A string argument.\""}],
     file="../../../devo/gdb/testsuite/gdb.mi/basics.c",
     fullname="/home/foo/bar/devo/gdb/testsuite/gdb.mi/basics.c",line="18"}
     (gdb)

The '-exec-run' Command
-----------------------

Synopsis
........

      -exec-run [ --all | --thread-group N ] [ --start ]

   Starts execution of the inferior from the beginning.  The inferior
executes until either a breakpoint is encountered or the program exits.
In the latter case the output will include an exit code, if the program
has exited exceptionally.

   When neither the '--all' nor the '--thread-group' option is
specified, the current inferior is started.  If the '--thread-group'
option is specified, it should refer to a thread group of type
'process', and that thread group will be started.  If the '--all' option
is specified, then all inferiors will be started.

   Using the '--start' option instructs the debugger to stop the
execution at the start of the inferior's main subprogram, following the
same behavior as the 'start' command (*note Starting::).

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'run'.

Examples
........

     (gdb)
     -break-insert main
     ^done,bkpt={number="1",addr="0x0001072c",file="recursive2.c",line="4"}
     (gdb)
     -exec-run
     ^running
     (gdb)
     *stopped,reason="breakpoint-hit",disp="keep",bkptno="1",
     frame={func="main",args=[],file="recursive2.c",
     fullname="/home/foo/bar/recursive2.c",line="4"}
     (gdb)

Program exited normally:

     (gdb)
     -exec-run
     ^running
     (gdb)
     x = 55
     *stopped,reason="exited-normally"
     (gdb)

Program exited exceptionally:

     (gdb)
     -exec-run
     ^running
     (gdb)
     x = 55
     *stopped,reason="exited",exit-code="01"
     (gdb)

   Another way the program can terminate is if it receives a signal such
as 'SIGINT'.  In this case, GDB/MI displays this:

     (gdb)
     *stopped,reason="exited-signalled",signal-name="SIGINT",
     signal-meaning="Interrupt"

The '-exec-step' Command
------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -exec-step [--reverse]

   Resumes execution of the inferior program, stopping when the
beginning of the next source line is reached, if the next source line is
not a function call.  If it is, stop at the first instruction of the
called function.  If the '--reverse' option is specified, resumes
reverse execution of the inferior program, stopping at the beginning of
the previously executed source line.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'step'.

Example
.......

Stepping into a function:

     -exec-step
     ^running
     (gdb)
     *stopped,reason="end-stepping-range",
     frame={func="foo",args=[{name="a",value="10"},
     {name="b",value="0"}],file="recursive2.c",
     fullname="/home/foo/bar/recursive2.c",line="11"}
     (gdb)

   Regular stepping:

     -exec-step
     ^running
     (gdb)
     *stopped,reason="end-stepping-range",line="14",file="recursive2.c"
     (gdb)

The '-exec-step-instruction' Command
------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -exec-step-instruction [--reverse]

   Resumes the inferior which executes one machine instruction.  If the
'--reverse' option is specified, resumes reverse execution of the
inferior program, stopping at the previously executed instruction.  The
output, once GDB has stopped, will vary depending on whether we have
stopped in the middle of a source line or not.  In the former case, the
address at which the program stopped will be printed as well.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'stepi'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -exec-step-instruction
     ^running

     (gdb)
     *stopped,reason="end-stepping-range",
     frame={func="foo",args=[],file="try.c",
     fullname="/home/foo/bar/try.c",line="10"}
     (gdb)
     -exec-step-instruction
     ^running

     (gdb)
     *stopped,reason="end-stepping-range",
     frame={addr="0x000100f4",func="foo",args=[],file="try.c",
     fullname="/home/foo/bar/try.c",line="10"}
     (gdb)

The '-exec-until' Command
-------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -exec-until [ LOCATION ]

   Executes the inferior until the LOCATION specified in the argument is
reached.  If there is no argument, the inferior executes until a source
line greater than the current one is reached.  The reason for stopping
in this case will be 'location-reached'.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'until'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -exec-until recursive2.c:6
     ^running
     (gdb)
     x = 55
     *stopped,reason="location-reached",frame={func="main",args=[],

27.14 GDB/MI Stack Manipulation Commands
========================================

The '-enable-frame-filters' Command
-----------------------------------

     -enable-frame-filters

   GDB allows Python-based frame filters to affect the output of the MI
commands relating to stack traces.  As there is no way to implement this
in a fully backward-compatible way, a front end must request that this
functionality be enabled.

   Once enabled, this feature cannot be disabled.

   Note that if Python support has not been compiled into GDB, this
command will still succeed (and do nothing).

The '-stack-info-frame' Command
-------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -stack-info-frame

   Get info on the selected frame.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'info frame' or 'frame' (without
arguments).

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -stack-info-frame
     ^done,frame={level="1",addr="0x0001076c",func="callee3",
     file="../../../devo/gdb/testsuite/gdb.mi/basics.c",
     fullname="/home/foo/bar/devo/gdb/testsuite/gdb.mi/basics.c",line="17"}
     (gdb)

The '-stack-info-depth' Command
-------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -stack-info-depth [ MAX-DEPTH ]

   Return the depth of the stack.  If the integer argument MAX-DEPTH is
specified, do not count beyond MAX-DEPTH frames.

GDB Command
...........

There's no equivalent GDB command.

Example
.......

For a stack with frame levels 0 through 11:

     (gdb)
     -stack-info-depth
     ^done,depth="12"
     (gdb)
     -stack-info-depth 4
     ^done,depth="4"
     (gdb)
     -stack-info-depth 12
     ^done,depth="12"
     (gdb)
     -stack-info-depth 11
     ^done,depth="11"
     (gdb)
     -stack-info-depth 13
     ^done,depth="12"
     (gdb)

The '-stack-list-arguments' Command
-----------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -stack-list-arguments [ --no-frame-filters ] [ --skip-unavailable ] PRINT-VALUES
         [ LOW-FRAME HIGH-FRAME ]

   Display a list of the arguments for the frames between LOW-FRAME and
HIGH-FRAME (inclusive).  If LOW-FRAME and HIGH-FRAME are not provided,
list the arguments for the whole call stack.  If the two arguments are
equal, show the single frame at the corresponding level.  It is an error
if LOW-FRAME is larger than the actual number of frames.  On the other
hand, HIGH-FRAME may be larger than the actual number of frames, in
which case only existing frames will be returned.

   If PRINT-VALUES is 0 or '--no-values', print only the names of the
variables; if it is 1 or '--all-values', print also their values; and if
it is 2 or '--simple-values', print the name, type and value for simple
data types, and the name and type for arrays, structures and unions.  If
the option '--no-frame-filters' is supplied, then Python frame filters
will not be executed.

   If the '--skip-unavailable' option is specified, arguments that are
not available are not listed.  Partially available arguments are still
displayed, however.

   Use of this command to obtain arguments in a single frame is
deprecated in favor of the '-stack-list-variables' command.

GDB Command
...........

GDB does not have an equivalent command.  'gdbtk' has a 'gdb_get_args'
command which partially overlaps with the functionality of
'-stack-list-arguments'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -stack-list-frames
     ^done,

The '-stack-list-frames' Command
--------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -stack-list-frames [ --no-frame-filters LOW-FRAME HIGH-FRAME ]

   List the frames currently on the stack.  For each frame it displays
the following info:

'LEVEL'
     The frame number, 0 being the topmost frame, i.e., the innermost
     function.
'ADDR'
     The '$pc' value for that frame.
'FUNC'
     Function name.
'FILE'
     File name of the source file where the function lives.
'FULLNAME'
     The full file name of the source file where the function lives.
'LINE'
     Line number corresponding to the '$pc'.
'FROM'
     The shared library where this function is defined.  This is only
     given if the frame's function is not known.

   If invoked without arguments, this command prints a backtrace for the
whole stack.  If given two integer arguments, it shows the frames whose
levels are between the two arguments (inclusive).  If the two arguments
are equal, it shows the single frame at the corresponding level.  It is
an error if LOW-FRAME is larger than the actual number of frames.  On
the other hand, HIGH-FRAME may be larger than the actual number of
frames, in which case only existing frames will be returned.  If the
option '--no-frame-filters' is supplied, then Python frame filters will
not be executed.

GDB Command

The '-stack-list-locals' Command
--------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -stack-list-locals [ --no-frame-filters ] [ --skip-unavailable ] PRINT-VALUES

   Display the local variable names for the selected frame.  If
PRINT-VALUES is 0 or '--no-values', print only the names of the
variables; if it is 1 or '--all-values', print also their values; and if
it is 2 or '--simple-values', print the name, type and value for simple
data types, and the name and type for arrays, structures and unions.  In
this last case, a frontend can immediately display the value of simple
data types and create variable objects for other data types when the
user wishes to explore their values in more detail.  If the option
'--no-frame-filters' is supplied, then Python frame filters will not be
executed.

   If the '--skip-unavailable' option is specified, local variables that
are not available are not listed.  Partially available local variables
are still displayed, however.

   This command is deprecated in favor of the '-stack-list-variables'
command.

27.15 GDB/MI Variable Objects
=============================

Introduction to Variable Objects
--------------------------------

Variable objects are "object-oriented" MI interface for examining and
changing values of expressions.  Unlike some other MI interfaces that
work with expressions, variable objects are specifically designed for
simple and efficient presentation in the frontend.  A variable object is
identified by string name.  When a variable object is created, the
frontend specifies the expression for that variable object.  The
expression can be a simple variable, or it can be an arbitrary complex
expression, and can even involve CPU registers.  After creating a
variable object, the frontend can invoke other variable object
operations--for example to obtain or change the value of a variable
object, or to change display format.

   Variable objects have hierarchical tree structure.  Any variable
object that corresponds to a composite type, such as structure in C, has
a number of child variable objects, for example corresponding to each
element of a structure.  A child variable object can itself have
children, recursively.  Recursion ends when we reach leaf variable
objects, which always have built-in types.  Child variable objects are
created only by explicit request, so if a frontend is not interested in
the children of a particular variable object, no child will be created.

   For a leaf variable object it is possible to obtain its value as a
string, or set the value from a string.  String value can be also
obtained for a non-leaf variable object, but it's generally a string
that only indicates the type of the object, and does not list its
contents.  Assignment to a non-leaf variable object is not allowed.

   A frontend does not need to read the values of all variable objects
each time the program stops.  Instead, MI provides an update command
that lists all variable objects whose values has changed since the last
update operation.  This considerably reduces the amount of data that
must be transferred to the frontend.  As noted above, children variable
objects are created on demand, and only leaf variable objects have a
real value.  As result, gdb will read target memory only for leaf
variables that frontend has created.

   The automatic update is not always desirable.  For example, a
frontend might want to keep a value of some expression for future
reference, and never update it.  For another example, fetching memory is
relatively slow for embedded targets, so a frontend might want to
disable automatic update for the variables that are either not visible
on the screen, or "closed".  This is possible using so called "frozen
variable objects".  Such variable objects are never implicitly updated.

   Variable objects can be either "fixed" or "floating".  For the fixed
variable object, the expression is parsed when the variable object is
created, including associating identifiers to specific variables.  The
meaning of expression never changes.  For a floating variable object the
values of variables whose names appear in the expressions are
re-evaluated every time in the context of the current frame.  Consider
this example:

     void do_work(...)
     {
             struct work_state state;

             if (...)
                do_work(...);
     }

   If a fixed variable object for the 'state' variable is created in
this function, and we enter the recursive call, the variable object will
report the value of 'state' in the top-level 'do_work' invocation.  On
the other hand, a floating variable object will report the value of
'state' in the current frame.

   If an expression specified when creating a fixed variable object
refers to a local variable, the variable object becomes bound to the
thread and frame in which the variable object is created.  When such
variable object is updated, GDB makes sure that the thread/frame
combination the variable object is bound to still exists, and
re-evaluates the variable object in context of that thread/frame.

   The following is the complete set of GDB/MI operations defined to
access this functionality:

*Operation*                   *Description*
                              
'-enable-pretty-printing'     enable Python-based pretty-printing
'-var-create'                 create a variable object
'-var-delete'                 delete the variable object and/or its
                              children
'-var-set-format'             set the display format of this variable
'-var-show-format'            show the display format of this variable
'-var-info-num-children'      tells how many children this object has
'-var-list-children'          return a list of the object's children
'-var-info-type'              show the type of this variable object
'-var-info-expression'        print parent-relative expression that
                              this variable object represents
'-var-info-path-expression'   print full expression that this variable
                              object represents
'-var-show-attributes'        is this variable editable?  does it exist
                              here?
'-var-evaluate-expression'    get the value of this variable
'-var-assign'                 set the value of this variable
'-var-update'                 update the variable and its children
'-var-set-frozen'             set frozeness attribute
'-var-set-update-range'       set range of children to display on
                              update

   In the next subsection we describe each operation in detail and
suggest how it can be used.

Description And Use of Operations on Variable Objects
-----------------------------------------------------

The '-enable-pretty-printing' Command
-------------------------------------

     -enable-pretty-printing

   GDB allows Python-based visualizers to affect the output of the MI
variable object commands.  However, because there was no way to
implement this in a fully backward-compatible way, a front end must
request that this functionality be enabled.

   Once enabled, this feature cannot be disabled.

   Note that if Python support has not been compiled into GDB, this
command will still succeed (and do nothing).

   This feature is currently (as of GDB 7.0) experimental, and may work
differently in future versions of GDB.

The '-var-create' Command
-------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-create {NAME | "-"}
         {FRAME-ADDR | "*" | "@"} EXPRESSION

   This operation creates a variable object, which allows the monitoring
of a variable, the result of an expression, a memory cell or a CPU
register.

   The NAME parameter is the string by which the object can be
referenced.  It must be unique.  If '-' is specified, the varobj system
will generate a string "varNNNNNN" automatically.  It will be unique
provided that one does not specify NAME of that format.  The command
fails if a duplicate name is found.

   The frame under which the expression should be evaluated can be
specified by FRAME-ADDR.  A '*' indicates that the current frame should
be used.  A '@' indicates that a floating variable object must be
created.

   EXPRESSION is any expression valid on the current language set (must
not begin with a '*'), or one of the following:

   * '*ADDR', where ADDR is the address of a memory cell

   * '*ADDR-ADDR' -- a memory address range (TBD)

   * '$REGNAME' -- a CPU register name

   A varobj's contents may be provided by a Python-based pretty-printer.
In this case the varobj is known as a "dynamic varobj".  Dynamic varobjs
have slightly different semantics in some cases.  If the
'-enable-pretty-printing' command is not sent, then GDB will never
create a dynamic varobj.  This ensures backward compatibility for
existing clients.

Result
......

This operation returns attributes of the newly-created varobj.  These
are:

'name'
     The name of the varobj.

'numchild'
     The number of children of the varobj.  This number is not
     necessarily reliable for a dynamic varobj.  Instead, you must
     examine the 'has_more' attribute.

'value'
     The varobj's scalar value.  For a varobj whose type is some sort of
     aggregate (e.g., a 'struct'), or for a dynamic varobj, this value
     will not be interesting.

'type'
     The varobj's type.  This is a string representation of the type, as
     would be printed by the GDB CLI. If 'print object' (*note set print
     object: Print Settings.) is set to 'on', the _actual_ (derived)
     type of the object is shown rather than the _declared_ one.

'thread-id'
     If a variable object is bound to a specific thread, then this is
     the thread's identifier.

'has_more'
     For a dynamic varobj, this indicates whether there appear to be any
     children available.  For a non-dynamic varobj, this will be 0.

'dynamic'
     This attribute will be present and have the value '1' if the varobj
     is a dynamic varobj.  If the varobj is not a dynamic varobj, then
     this attribute will not be present.

'displayhint'
     A dynamic varobj can supply a display hint to the front end.  The
     value comes directly from the Python pretty-printer object's
     'display_hint' method.  *Note Pretty Printing API::.

   Typical output will look like this:

      name="NAME",numchild="N",type="TYPE",thread-id="M",
       has_more="HAS_MORE"

The '-var-delete' Command
-------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-delete [ -c ] NAME

   Deletes a previously created variable object and all of its children.
With the '-c' option, just deletes the children.

   Returns an error if the object NAME is not found.

The '-var-set-format' Command
-----------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-set-format NAME FORMAT-SPEC

   Sets the output format for the value of the object NAME to be
FORMAT-SPEC.

   The syntax for the FORMAT-SPEC is as follows:

      FORMAT-SPEC ==>
      {binary | decimal | hexadecimal | octal | natural}

   The natural format is the default format choosen automatically based
on the variable type (like decimal for an 'int', hex for pointers,
etc.).

   For a variable with children, the format is set only on the variable
itself, and the children are not affected.

The '-var-show-format' Command
------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-show-format NAME

   Returns the format used to display the value of the object NAME.

      FORMAT ==>
      FORMAT-SPEC

The '-var-info-num-children' Command
------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-info-num-children NAME

   Returns the number of children of a variable object NAME:

      numchild=N

   Note that this number is not completely reliable for a dynamic
varobj.  It will return the current number of children, but more
children may be available.

The '-var-list-children' Command
--------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-list-children [PRINT-VALUES] NAME [FROM TO]

   Return a list of the children of the specified variable object and
create variable objects for them, if they do not already exist.  With a
single argument or if PRINT-VALUES has a value of 0 or '--no-values',
print only the names of the variables; if PRINT-VALUES is 1 or
'--all-values', also print their values; and if it is 2 or
'--simple-values' print the name and value for simple data types and
just the name for arrays, structures and unions.

   FROM and TO, if specified, indicate the range of children to report.
If FROM or TO is less than zero, the range is reset and all children
will be reported.  Otherwise, children starting at FROM (zero-based) and
up to and excluding TO will be reported.

   If a child range is requested, it will only affect the current call
to '-var-list-children', but not future calls to '-var-update'.  For
this, you must instead use '-var-set-update-range'.  The intent of this
approach is to enable a front end to implement any update approach it
likes; for example, scrolling a view may cause the front end to request
more children with '-var-list-children', and then the front end could
call '-var-set-update-range' with a different range to ensure that
future updates are restricted to just the visible items.

   For each child the following results are returned:

NAME
     Name of the variable object created for this child.

EXP
     The expression to be shown to the user by the front end to
     designate this child.  For example this may be the name of a
     structure member.

     For a dynamic varobj, this value cannot be used to form an
     expression.  There is no way to do this at all with a dynamic
     varobj.

     For C/C++ structures there are several pseudo children returned to
     designate access qualifiers.  For these pseudo children EXP is
     'public', 'private', or 'protected'.  In this case the type and
     value are not present.

     A dynamic varobj will not report the access qualifying
     pseudo-children, regardless of the language.  This information is
     not available at all with a dynamic varobj.

NUMCHILD
     Number of children this child has.  For a dynamic varobj, this will
     be 0.

TYPE
     The type of the child.  If 'print object' (*note set print object:
     Print Settings.) is set to 'on', the _actual_ (derived) type of the
     object is shown rather than the _declared_ one.

VALUE
     If values were requested, this is the value.

THREAD-ID
     If this variable object is associated with a thread, this is the
     thread id.  Otherwise this result is not present.

FROZEN
     If the variable object is frozen, this variable will be present
     with a value of 1.

DISPLAYHINT
     A dynamic varobj can supply a display hint to the front end.  The
     value comes directly from the Python pretty-printer object's
     'display_hint' method.  *Note Pretty Printing API::.

DYNAMIC
     This attribute will be present and have the value '1' if the varobj
     is a dynamic varobj.  If the varobj is not a dynamic varobj, then
     this attribute will not be present.

   The result may have its own attributes:

'displayhint'
     A dynamic varobj can supply a display hint to the front end.  The
     value comes directly from the Python pretty-printer object's
     'display_hint' method.  *Note Pretty Printing API::.

'has_more'
     This is an integer attribute which is nonzero if there are children
     remaining after the end of the selected range.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
      -var-list-children n
      ^done,numchild=N,children=[child={name=NAME,exp=EXP,
      numchild=N,type=TYPE},(repeats N times)]
     (gdb)
      -var-list-children --all-values n
      ^done,numchild=N,children=[child={name=NAME,exp=EXP,
      numchild=N,value=VALUE,type=TYPE},(repeats N times)]

The '-var-info-type' Command
----------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-info-type NAME

   Returns the type of the specified variable NAME.  The type is
returned as a string in the same format as it is output by the GDB CLI:

      type=TYPENAME

The '-var-info-expression' Command
----------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-info-expression NAME

   Returns a string that is suitable for presenting this variable object
in user interface.  The string is generally not valid expression in the
current language, and cannot be evaluated.

   For example, if 'a' is an array, and variable object 'A' was created
for 'a', then we'll get this output:

     (gdb) -var-info-expression A.1
     ^done,lang="C",exp="1"

Here, the value of 'lang' is the language name, which can be found in
*note Supported Languages::.

   Note that the output of the '-var-list-children' command also
includes those expressions, so the '-var-info-expression' command is of
limited use.

The '-var-info-path-expression' Command
---------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-info-path-expression NAME

   Returns an expression that can be evaluated in the current context
and will yield the same value that a variable object has.  Compare this
with the '-var-info-expression' command, which result can be used only
for UI presentation.  Typical use of the '-var-info-path-expression'
command is creating a watchpoint from a variable object.

   This command is currently not valid for children of a dynamic varobj,
and will give an error when invoked on one.

   For example, suppose 'C' is a C++ class, derived from class 'Base',
and that the 'Base' class has a member called 'm_size'.  Assume a
variable 'c' is has the type of 'C' and a variable object 'C' was
created for variable 'c'.  Then, we'll get this output:
     (gdb) -var-info-path-expression C.Base.public.m_size
     ^done,path_expr=((Base)c).m_size)

The '-var-show-attributes' Command
----------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-show-attributes NAME

   List attributes of the specified variable object NAME:

      status=ATTR [ ( ,ATTR )* ]

where ATTR is '{ { editable | noneditable } | TBD }'.

The '-var-evaluate-expression' Command
--------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-evaluate-expression [-f FORMAT-SPEC] NAME

   Evaluates the expression that is represented by the specified
variable object and returns its value as a string.  The format of the
string can be specified with the '-f' option.  The possible values of
this option are the same as for '-var-set-format' (*note
-var-set-format::).  If the '-f' option is not specified, the current
display format will be used.  The current display format can be changed
using the '-var-set-format' command.

      value=VALUE

   Note that one must invoke '-var-list-children' for a variable before
the value of a child variable can be evaluated.

The '-var-assign' Command
-------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-assign NAME EXPRESSION

   Assigns the value of EXPRESSION to the variable object specified by
NAME.  The object must be 'editable'.  If the variable's value is
altered by the assign, the variable will show up in any subsequent
'-var-update' list.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -var-assign var1 3
     ^done,value="3"
     (gdb)
     -var-update *
     ^done,changelist=[{name="var1",in_scope="true",type_changed="false"}]
     (gdb)

The '-var-update' Command
-------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-update [PRINT-VALUES] {NAME | "*"}

   Reevaluate the expressions corresponding to the variable object NAME
and all its direct and indirect children, and return the list of
variable objects whose values have changed; NAME must be a root variable
object.  Here, "changed" means that the result of
'-var-evaluate-expression' before and after the '-var-update' is
different.  If '*' is used as the variable object names, all existing
variable objects are updated, except for frozen ones (*note
-var-set-frozen::).  The option PRINT-VALUES determines whether both
names and values, or just names are printed.  The possible values of
this option are the same as for '-var-list-children' (*note
-var-list-children::).  It is recommended to use the '--all-values'
option, to reduce the number of MI commands needed on each program stop.

   With the '*' parameter, if a variable object is bound to a currently
running thread, it will not be updated, without any diagnostic.

   If '-var-set-update-range' was previously used on a varobj, then only
the selected range of children will be reported.

   '-var-update' reports all the changed varobjs in a tuple named
'changelist'.

   Each item in the change list is itself a tuple holding:

'name'
     The name of the varobj.

'value'
     If values were requested for this update, then this field will be
     present and will hold the value of the varobj.

'in_scope'
     This field is a string which may take one of three values:

     '"true"'
          The variable object's current value is valid.

     '"false"'
          The variable object does not currently hold a valid value but
          it may hold one in the future if its associated expression
          comes back into scope.

     '"invalid"'
          The variable object no longer holds a valid value.  This can
          occur when the executable file being debugged has changed,
          either through recompilation or by using the GDB 'file'
          command.  The front end should normally choose to delete these
          variable objects.

     In the future new values may be added to this list so the front
     should be prepared for this possibility.  *Note GDB/MI Development
     and Front Ends: GDB/MI Development and Front Ends.

'type_changed'
     This is only present if the varobj is still valid.  If the type
     changed, then this will be the string 'true'; otherwise it will be
     'false'.

     When a varobj's type changes, its children are also likely to have
     become incorrect.  Therefore, the varobj's children are
     automatically deleted when this attribute is 'true'.  Also, the
     varobj's update range, when set using the '-var-set-update-range'
     command, is unset.

'new_type'
     If the varobj's type changed, then this field will be present and
     will hold the new type.

'new_num_children'
     For a dynamic varobj, if the number of children changed, or if the
     type changed, this will be the new number of children.

     The 'numchild' field in other varobj responses is generally not
     valid for a dynamic varobj - it will show the number of children
     that GDB knows about, but because dynamic varobjs lazily
     instantiate their children, this will not reflect the number of
     children which may be available.

     The 'new_num_children' attribute only reports changes to the number
     of children known by GDB.  This is the only way to detect whether
     an update has removed children (which necessarily can only happen
     at the end of the update range).

'displayhint'
     The display hint, if any.

'has_more'
     This is an integer value, which will be 1 if there are more
     children available outside the varobj's update range.

'dynamic'
     This attribute will be present and have the value '1' if the varobj
     is a dynamic varobj.  If the varobj is not a dynamic varobj, then
     this attribute will not be present.

'new_children'
     If new children were added to a dynamic varobj within the selected
     update range (as set by '-var-set-update-range'), then they will be
     listed in this attribute.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -var-assign var1 3
     ^done,value="3"
     (gdb)
     -var-update --all-values var1
     ^done,changelist=[{name="var1",value="3",in_scope="true",
     type_changed="false"}]
     (gdb)

The '-var-set-frozen' Command
-----------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-set-frozen NAME FLAG

   Set the frozenness flag on the variable object NAME.  The FLAG
parameter should be either '1' to make the variable frozen or '0' to
make it unfrozen.  If a variable object is frozen, then neither itself,
nor any of its children, are implicitly updated by '-var-update' of a
parent variable or by '-var-update *'.  Only '-var-update' of the
variable itself will update its value and values of its children.  After
a variable object is unfrozen, it is implicitly updated by all
subsequent '-var-update' operations.  Unfreezing a variable does not
update it, only subsequent '-var-update' does.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -var-set-frozen V 1
     ^done
     (gdb)

The '-var-set-update-range' command
-----------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-set-update-range NAME FROM TO

   Set the range of children to be returned by future invocations of
'-var-update'.

   FROM and TO indicate the range of children to report.  If FROM or TO
is less than zero, the range is reset and all children will be reported.
Otherwise, children starting at FROM (zero-based) and up to and
excluding TO will be reported.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -var-set-update-range V 1 2
     ^done

The '-var-set-visualizer' command
---------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-set-visualizer NAME VISUALIZER

   Set a visualizer for the variable object NAME.

   VISUALIZER is the visualizer to use.  The special value 'None' means
to disable any visualizer in use.

   If not 'None', VISUALIZER must be a Python expression.  This
expression must evaluate to a callable object which accepts a single
argument.  GDB will call this object with the value of the varobj NAME
as an argument (this is done so that the same Python pretty-printing
code can be used for both the CLI and MI). When called, this object must
return an object which conforms to the pretty-printing interface (*note
Pretty Printing API::).

   The pre-defined function 'gdb.default_visualizer' may be used to
select a visualizer by following the built-in process (*note Selecting
Pretty-Printers::).  This is done automatically when a varobj is
created, and so ordinarily is not needed.

   This feature is only available if Python support is enabled.  The MI
command '-list-features' (*note GDB/MI Support Commands::) can be used
to check this.

Example
.......

Resetting the visualizer:

     (gdb)
     -var-set-visualizer V None
     ^done

   Reselecting the default (type-based) visualizer:

     (gdb)
     -var-set-visualizer V gdb.default_visualizer
     ^done

   Suppose 'SomeClass' is a visualizer class.  A lambda expression can
be used to instantiate this class for a varobj:

     (gdb)
     -var-set-visualizer V "lambda val: SomeClass()"
     ^done

27.16 GDB/MI Data Manipulation
==============================

This section describes the GDB/MI commands that manipulate data: examine
memory and registers, evaluate expressions, etc.

The '-data-disassemble' Command
-------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -data-disassemble
         [ -s START-ADDR -e END-ADDR ]
       | [ -f FILENAME -l LINENUM [ -n LINES ] ]
       -- MODE

Where:

'START-ADDR'
     is the beginning address (or '$pc')
'END-ADDR'
     is the end address
'FILENAME'
     is the name of the file to disassemble
'LINENUM'
     is the line number to disassemble around
'LINES'
     is the number of disassembly lines to be produced.  If it is -1,
     the whole function will be disassembled, in case no END-ADDR is
     specified.  If END-ADDR is specified as a non-zero value, and LINES
     is lower than the number of disassembly lines between START-ADDR
     and END-ADDR, only LINES lines are displayed; if LINES is higher
     than the number of lines between START-ADDR and END-ADDR, only the
     lines up to END-ADDR are displayed.
'MODE'
     is either 0 (meaning only disassembly), 1 (meaning mixed source and
     disassembly), 2 (meaning disassembly with raw opcodes), or 3
     (meaning mixed source and disassembly with raw opcodes).

Result
......

The result of the '-data-disassemble' command will be a list named
'asm_insns', the contents of this list depend on the MODE used with the
'-data-disassemble' command.

   For modes 0 and 2 the 'asm_insns' list contains tuples with the
following fields:

'address'
     The address at which this instruction was disassembled.

'func-name'
     The name of the function this instruction is within.

'offset'
     The decimal offset in bytes from the start of 'func-name'.

'inst'
     The text disassembly for this 'address'.

'opcodes'
     This field is only present for mode 2.  This contains the raw
     opcode bytes for the 'inst' field.

   For modes 1 and 3 the 'asm_insns' list contains tuples named
'src_and_asm_line', each of which has the following fields:

'line'
     The line number within 'file'.

'file'
     The file name from the compilation unit.  This might be an absolute
     file name or a relative file name depending on the compile command
     used.

'fullname'
     Absolute file name of 'file'.  It is converted to a canonical form
     using the source file search path (*note Specifying Source
     Directories: Source Path.) and after resolving all the symbolic
     links.

     If the source file is not found this field will contain the path as
     present in the debug information.

'line_asm_insn'
     This is a list of tuples containing the disassembly for 'line' in
     'file'.  The fields of each tuple are the same as for
     '-data-disassemble' in MODE 0 and 2, so 'address', 'func-name',
     'offset', 'inst', and optionally 'opcodes'.

   Note that whatever included in the 'inst' field, is not manipulated
directly by GDB/MI, i.e., it is not possible to adjust its format.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'disassemble'.

Example
.......

Disassemble from the current value of '$pc' to '$pc + 20':

     (gdb)
     -data-disassemble -s $pc -e "$pc + 20" -- 0
     ^done,
     asm_insns=[
     {address="0x000107c0",func-name="main",offset="4",
     inst="mov  2, %o0"},
     {address="0x000107c4",func-name="main",offset="8",
     inst="sethi  %hi(0x11800), %o2"},
     {address="0x000107c8",func-name="main",offset="12",
     inst="or  %o2, 0x140, %o1\t! 0x11940 <_lib_version+8>"},
     {address="0x000107cc",func-name="main",offset="16",
     inst="sethi  %hi(0x11800), %o2"},
     {address="0x000107d0",func-name="main",offset="20",
     inst="or  %o2, 0x168, %o4\t! 0x11968 <_lib_version+48>"}]
     (gdb)

   Disassemble the whole 'main' function.  Line 32 is part of 'main'.

     -data-disassemble -f basics.c -l 32 -- 0
     ^done,asm_insns=[
     {address="0x000107bc",func-name="main",offset="0",
     inst="save  %sp, -112, %sp"},
     {address="0x000107c0",func-name="main",offset="4",
     inst="mov   2, %o0"},
     {address="0x000107c4",func-name="main",offset="8",
     inst="sethi %hi(0x11800), %o2"},
     [...]
     {address="0x0001081c",func-name="main",offset="96",inst="ret "},
     {address="0x00010820",func-name="main",offset="100",inst="restore "}]
     (gdb)

   Disassemble 3 instructions from the start of 'main':

     (gdb)
     -data-disassemble -f basics.c -l 32 -n 3 -- 0
     ^done,asm_insns=[
     {address="0x000107bc",func-name="main",offset="0",
     inst="save  %sp, -112, %sp"},
     {address="0x000107c0",func-name="main",offset="4",
     inst="mov  2, %o0"},
     {address="0x000107c4",func-name="main",offset="8",
     inst="sethi  %hi(0x11800), %o2"}]
     (gdb)

   Disassemble 3 instructions from the start of 'main' in mixed mode:

     (gdb)
     -data-disassemble -f basics.c -l 32 -n 3 -- 1
     ^done,asm_insns=[
     src_and_asm_line={line="31",
     file="../../../src/gdb/testsuite/gdb.mi/basics.c",
     fullname="/absolute/path/to/src/gdb/testsuite/gdb.mi/basics.c",
     line_asm_insn=[{address="0x000107bc",
     func-name="main",offset="0",inst="save  %sp, -112, %sp"}]},
     src_and_asm_line={line="32",
     file="../../../src/gdb/testsuite/gdb.mi/basics.c",
     fullname="/absolute/path/to/src/gdb/testsuite/gdb.mi/basics.c",
     line_asm_insn=[{address="0x000107c0",
     func-name="main",offset="4",inst="mov  2, %o0"},
     {address="0x000107c4",func-name="main",offset="8",
     inst="sethi  %hi(0x11800), %o2"}]}]
     (gdb)

The '-data-evaluate-expression' Command
---------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -data-evaluate-expression EXPR

   Evaluate EXPR as an expression.  The expression could contain an
inferior function call.  The function call will execute synchronously.
If the expression contains spaces, it must be enclosed in double quotes.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB commands are 'print', 'output', and 'call'.  In
'gdbtk' only, there's a corresponding 'gdb_eval' command.

Example
.......

In the following example, the numbers that precede the commands are the
"tokens" described in *note GDB/MI Command Syntax: GDB/MI Command
Syntax.  Notice how GDB/MI returns the same tokens in its output.

     211-data-evaluate-expression A
     211^done,value="1"
     (gdb)
     311-data-evaluate-expression &A
     311^done,value="0xefffeb7c"
     (gdb)
     411-data-evaluate-expression A+3
     411^done,value="4"
     (gdb)
     511-data-evaluate-expression "A + 3"
     511^done,value="4"
     (gdb)

The '-data-list-changed-registers' Command
------------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -data-list-changed-registers

   Display a list of the registers that have changed.

GDB Command
...........

GDB doesn't have a direct analog for this command; 'gdbtk' has the
corresponding command 'gdb_changed_register_list'.

Example
.......

On a PPC MBX board:

     (gdb)
     -exec-continue
     ^running

     (gdb)
     *stopped,reason="breakpoint-hit",disp="keep",bkptno="1",frame={
     func="main",args=[],file="try.c",fullname="/home/foo/bar/try.c",
     line="5"}
     (gdb)
     -data-list-changed-registers
     ^done,changed-registers=["0","1","2","4","5","6","7","8","9",
     "10","11","13","14","15","16","17","18","19","20","21","22","23",
     "24","25","26","27","28","30","31","64","65","66","67","69"]
     (gdb)

The '-data-list-register-names' Command
---------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -data-list-register-names [ ( REGNO )+ ]

   Show a list of register names for the current target.  If no
arguments are given, it shows a list of the names of all the registers.
If integer numbers are given as arguments, it will print a list of the
names of the registers corresponding to the arguments.  To ensure
consistency between a register name and its number, the output list may
include empty register names.

GDB Command
...........

GDB does not have a command which corresponds to
'-data-list-register-names'.  In 'gdbtk' there is a corresponding
command 'gdb_regnames'.

Example
.......

For the PPC MBX board:
     (gdb)
     -data-list-register-names
     ^done,register-names=["r0","r1","r2","r3","r4","r5","r6","r7",
     "r8","r9","r10","r11","r12","r13","r14","r15","r16","r17","r18",
     "r19","r20","r21","r22","r23","r24","r25","r26","r27","r28","r29",
     "r30","r31","f0","f1","f2","f3","f4","f5","f6","f7","f8","f9",
     "f10","f11","f12","f13","f14","f15","f16","f17","f18","f19","f20",
     "f21","f22","f23","f24","f25","f26","f27","f28","f29","f30","f31",
     "", "pc","ps","cr","lr","ctr","xer"]
     (gdb)
     -data-list-register-names 1 2 3
     ^done,register-names=["r1","r2","r3"]
     (gdb)

The '-data-list-register-values' Command
----------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -data-list-register-values
         [ --skip-unavailable ] FMT [ ( REGNO )*]

   Display the registers' contents.  FMT is the format according to
which the registers' contents are to be returned, followed by an
optional list of numbers specifying the registers to display.  A missing
list of numbers indicates that the contents of all the registers must be
returned.  The '--skip-unavailable' option indicates that only the
available registers are to be returned.

   Allowed formats for FMT are:

'x'
     Hexadecimal
'o'
     Octal
't'
     Binary
'd'
     Decimal
'r'
     Raw
'N'
     Natural

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB commands are 'info reg', 'info all-reg', and (in
'gdbtk') 'gdb_fetch_registers'.

Example
.......

For a PPC MBX board (note: line breaks are for readability only, they
don't appear in the actual output):

     (gdb)
     -data-list-register-values r 64 65
     ^done,register-values=[{number="64",value="0xfe00a300"},
     {number="65",value="0x00029002"}]

The '-data-read-memory' Command
-------------------------------

This command is deprecated, use '-data-read-memory-bytes' instead.

Synopsis
........

      -data-read-memory [ -o BYTE-OFFSET ]
        ADDRESS WORD-FORMAT WORD-SIZE
        NR-ROWS NR-COLS [ ASCHAR ]

where:

'ADDRESS'
     An expression specifying the address of the first memory word to be
     read.  Complex expressions containing embedded white space should
     be quoted using the C convention.

'WORD-FORMAT'
     The format to be used to print the memory words.  The notation is
     the same as for GDB's 'print' command (*note Output Formats: Output
     Formats.).

'WORD-SIZE'
     The size of each memory word in bytes.

'NR-ROWS'
     The number of rows in the output table.

'NR-COLS'
     The number of columns in the output table.

'ASCHAR'
     If present, indicates that each row should include an ASCII dump.
     The value of ASCHAR is used as a padding character when a byte is
     not a member of the printable ASCII character set (printable ASCII
     characters are those whose code is between 32 and 126,
     inclusively).

'BYTE-OFFSET'
     An offset to add to the ADDRESS before fetching memory.

   This command displays memory contents as a table of NR-ROWS by
NR-COLS words, each word being WORD-SIZE bytes.  In total, 'NR-ROWS *
NR-COLS * WORD-SIZE' bytes are read (returned as 'total-bytes').  Should
less than the requested number of bytes be returned by the target, the
missing words are identified using 'N/A'.  The number of bytes read from
the target is returned in 'nr-bytes' and the starting address used to
read memory in 'addr'.

   The address of the next/previous row or page is available in
'next-row' and 'prev-row', 'next-page' and 'prev-page'.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'x'.  'gdbtk' has 'gdb_get_mem' memory
read command.

Example
.......

Read six bytes of memory starting at 'bytes+6' but then offset by '-6'
bytes.  Format as three rows of two columns.  One byte per word.
Display each word in hex.

The '-data-read-memory-bytes' Command
-------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -data-read-memory-bytes [ -o BYTE-OFFSET ]
        ADDRESS COUNT

where:

'ADDRESS'
     An expression specifying the address of the first memory word to be
     read.  Complex expressions containing embedded white space should
     be quoted using the C convention.

'COUNT'
     The number of bytes to read.  This should be an integer literal.

'BYTE-OFFSET'
     The offsets in bytes relative to ADDRESS at which to start reading.
     This should be an integer literal.  This option is provided so that
     a frontend is not required to first evaluate address and then
     perform address arithmetics itself.

   This command attempts to read all accessible memory regions in the
specified range.  First, all regions marked as unreadable in the memory
map (if one is defined) will be skipped.  *Note Memory Region
Attributes::.  Second, GDB will attempt to read the remaining regions.
For each one, if reading full region results in an errors, GDB will try
to read a subset of the region.

   In general, every single byte in the region may be readable or not,
and the only way to read every readable byte is to try a read at every
address, which is not practical.  Therefore, GDB will attempt to read
all accessible bytes at either beginning or the end of the region, using
a binary division scheme.  This heuristic works well for reading accross
a memory map boundary.  Note that if a region has a readable range that
is neither at the beginning or the end, GDB will not read it.

   The result record (*note GDB/MI Result Records::) that is output of
the command includes a field named 'memory' whose content is a list of
tuples.  Each tuple represent a successfully read memory block and has
the following fields:

'begin'
     The start address of the memory block, as hexadecimal literal.

'end'
     The end address of the memory block, as hexadecimal literal.

'offset'
     The offset of the memory block, as hexadecimal literal, relative to
     the start address passed to '-data-read-memory-bytes'.

'contents'
     The contents of the memory block, in hex.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'x'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -data-read-memory-bytes &a 10
     ^done,memory=[{begin="0xbffff154",offset="0x00000000",
                   end="0xbffff15e",
                   contents="01000000020000000300"}]
     (gdb)

The '-data-write-memory-bytes' Command
--------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -data-write-memory-bytes ADDRESS CONTENTS
      -data-write-memory-bytes ADDRESS CONTENTS [COUNT]

where:

'ADDRESS'
     An expression specifying the address of the first memory word to be
     read.  Complex expressions containing embedded white space should
     be quoted using the C convention.

'CONTENTS'
     The hex-encoded bytes to write.

'COUNT'
     Optional argument indicating the number of bytes to be written.  If
     COUNT is greater than CONTENTS' length, GDB will repeatedly write
     CONTENTS until it fills COUNT bytes.

GDB Command
...........

There's no corresponding GDB command.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -data-write-memory-bytes &a "aabbccdd"

27.17 GDB/MI Tracepoint Commands
================================

The commands defined in this section implement MI support for
tracepoints.  For detailed introduction, see *note Tracepoints::.

The '-trace-find' Command
-------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -trace-find MODE [PARAMETERS...]

   Find a trace frame using criteria defined by MODE and PARAMETERS.
The following table lists permissible modes and their parameters.  For
details of operation, see *note tfind::.

'none'
     No parameters are required.  Stops examining trace frames.

'frame-number'
     An integer is required as parameter.  Selects tracepoint frame with
     that index.

'tracepoint-number'
     An integer is required as parameter.  Finds next trace frame that
     corresponds to tracepoint with the specified number.

'pc'
     An address is required as parameter.  Finds next trace frame that
     corresponds to any tracepoint at the specified address.

'pc-inside-range'
     Two addresses are required as parameters.  Finds next trace frame
     that corresponds to a tracepoint at an address inside the specified
     range.  Both bounds are considered to be inside the range.

'pc-outside-range'
     Two addresses are required as parameters.  Finds next trace frame
     that corresponds to a tracepoint at an address outside the
     specified range.  Both bounds are considered to be inside the
     range.

'line'
     Line specification is required as parameter.  *Note Specify
     Location::.  Finds next trace frame that corresponds to a
     tracepoint at the specified location.

   If 'none' was passed as MODE, the response does not have fields.
Otherwise, the response may have the following fields:

'found'
     This field has either '0' or '1' as the value, depending on whether
     a matching tracepoint was found.

'traceframe'
     The index of the found traceframe.  This field is present iff the
     'found' field has value of '1'.

'tracepoint'
     The index of the found tracepoint.  This field is present iff the
     'found' field has value of '1'.

'frame'
     The information about the frame corresponding to the found trace
     frame.  This field is present only if a trace frame was found.
     *Note GDB/MI Frame Information::, for description of this field.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'tfind'.

-trace-define-variable
----------------------

Synopsis
........

      -trace-define-variable NAME [ VALUE ]

   Create trace variable NAME if it does not exist.  If VALUE is
specified, sets the initial value of the specified trace variable to
that value.  Note that the NAME should start with the '$' character.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'tvariable'.

The '-trace-frame-collected' Command
------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -trace-frame-collected
         [--var-print-values VAR_PVAL]
         [--comp-print-values COMP_PVAL]
         [--registers-format REGFORMAT]
         [--memory-contents]

   This command returns the set of collected objects, register names,
trace state variable names, memory ranges and computed expressions that
have been collected at a particular trace frame.  The optional
parameters to the command affect the output format in different ways.
See the output description table below for more details.

   The reported names can be used in the normal manner to create varobjs
and inspect the objects themselves.  The items returned by this command
are categorized so that it is clear which is a variable, which is a
register, which is a trace state variable, which is a memory range and
which is a computed expression.

   For instance, if the actions were
     collect myVar, myArray[myIndex], myObj.field, myPtr->field, myCount + 2
     collect *(int*)0xaf02bef0@40

the object collected in its entirety would be 'myVar'.  The object
'myArray' would be partially collected, because only the element at
index 'myIndex' would be collected.  The remaining objects would be
computed expressions.

   An example output would be:

     (gdb)
     -trace-frame-collected
     ^done,
       explicit-variables=[{name="myVar",value="1"}],
       computed-expressions=[{name="myArray[myIndex]",value="0"},
                             {name="myObj.field",value="0"},
                             {name="myPtr->field",value="1"},
                             {name="myCount + 2",value="3"},
                             {name="$tvar1 + 1",value="43970027"}],
       registers=[{number="0",value="0x7fe2c6e79ec8"},
                  {number="1",value="0x0"},
                  {number="2",value="0x4"},
                  ...
                  {number="125",value="0x0"}],
       tvars=[{name="$tvar1",current="43970026"}],
       memory=[{address="0x0000000000602264",length="4"},
               {address="0x0000000000615bc0",length="4"}]
     (gdb)

   Where:

'explicit-variables'
     The set of objects that have been collected in their entirety (as
     opposed to collecting just a few elements of an array or a few
     struct members).  For each object, its name and value are printed.
     The '--var-print-values' option affects how or whether the value
     field is output.  If VAR_PVAL is 0, then print only the names; if
     it is 1, print also their values; and if it is 2, print the name,
     type and value for simple data types, and the name and type for
     arrays, structures and unions.

'computed-expressions'
     The set of computed expressions that have been collected at the
     current trace frame.  The '--comp-print-values' option affects this
     set like the '--var-print-values' option affects the
     'explicit-variables' set.  See above.

'registers'
     The registers that have been collected at the current trace frame.
     For each register collected, the name and current value are
     returned.  The value is formatted according to the
     '--registers-format' option.  See the '-data-list-register-values'
     command for a list of the allowed formats.  The default is 'x'.

'tvars'
     The trace state variables that have been collected at the current
     trace frame.  For each trace state variable collected, the name and
     current value are returned.

'memory'
     The set of memory ranges that have been collected at the current
     trace frame.  Its content is a list of tuples.  Each tuple
     represents a collected memory range and has the following fields:

     'address'
          The start address of the memory range, as hexadecimal literal.

     'length'
          The length of the memory range, as decimal literal.

     'contents'
          The contents of the memory block, in hex.  This field is only
          present if the '--memory-contents' option is specified.

GDB Command
...........

There is no corresponding GDB command.

Example
.......

-trace-list-variables
---------------------

Synopsis
........

      -trace-list-variables

   Return a table of all defined trace variables.  Each element of the
table has the following fields:

'name'
     The name of the trace variable.  This field is always present.

'initial'
     The initial value.  This is a 64-bit signed integer.  This field is
     always present.

'current'
     The value the trace variable has at the moment.  This is a 64-bit
     signed integer.  This field is absent iff current value is not
     defined, for example if the trace was never run, or is presently
     running.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'tvariables'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -trace-list-variables
     ^done,trace-variables={nr_rows="1",nr_cols="3",
     hdr=[{width="15",alignment="-1",col_name="name",colhdr="Name"},
          {width="11",alignment="-1",col_name="initial",colhdr="Initial"},
          {width="11",alignment="-1",col_name="current",colhdr="Current"}],
     body=[variable={name="$trace_timestamp",initial="0"}
           variable={name="$foo",initial="10",current="15"}]}
     (gdb)

-trace-save
-----------

Synopsis
........

      -trace-save [-r ] FILENAME

   Saves the collected trace data to FILENAME.  Without the '-r' option,
the data is downloaded from the target and saved in a local file.  With
the '-r' option the target is asked to perform the save.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'tsave'.

-trace-start
------------

Synopsis
........

      -trace-start

   Starts a tracing experiments.  The result of this command does not
have any fields.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'tstart'.

-trace-status
-------------

Synopsis
........

      -trace-status

   Obtains the status of a tracing experiment.  The result may include
the following fields:

'supported'
     May have a value of either '0', when no tracing operations are
     supported, '1', when all tracing operations are supported, or
     'file' when examining trace file.  In the latter case, examining of
     trace frame is possible but new tracing experiement cannot be
     started.  This field is always present.

'running'
     May have a value of either '0' or '1' depending on whether tracing
     experiement is in progress on target.  This field is present if
     'supported' field is not '0'.

'stop-reason'
     Report the reason why the tracing was stopped last time.  This
     field may be absent iff tracing was never stopped on target yet.
     The value of 'request' means the tracing was stopped as result of
     the '-trace-stop' command.  The value of 'overflow' means the
     tracing buffer is full.  The value of 'disconnection' means tracing
     was automatically stopped when GDB has disconnected.  The value of
     'passcount' means tracing was stopped when a tracepoint was passed
     a maximal number of times for that tracepoint.  This field is
     present if 'supported' field is not '0'.

'stopping-tracepoint'
     The number of tracepoint whose passcount as exceeded.  This field
     is present iff the 'stop-reason' field has the value of
     'passcount'.

'frames'
'frames-created'
     The 'frames' field is a count of the total number of trace frames
     in the trace buffer, while 'frames-created' is the total created
     during the run, including ones that were discarded, such as when a
     circular trace buffer filled up.  Both fields are optional.

'buffer-size'
'buffer-free'
     These fields tell the current size of the tracing buffer and the
     remaining space.  These fields are optional.

'circular'
     The value of the circular trace buffer flag.  '1' means that the
     trace buffer is circular and old trace frames will be discarded if
     necessary to make room, '0' means that the trace buffer is linear
     and may fill up.

'disconnected'
     The value of the disconnected tracing flag.  '1' means that tracing
     will continue after GDB disconnects, '0' means that the trace run
     will stop.

'trace-file'
     The filename of the trace file being examined.  This field is
     optional, and only present when examining a trace file.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'tstatus'.

-trace-stop
-----------

Synopsis
........

      -trace-stop

   Stops a tracing experiment.  The result of this command has the same
fields as '-trace-status', except that the 'supported' and 'running'
fields are not output.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'tstop'.

27.19 GDB/MI File Commands
==========================

This section describes the GDB/MI commands to specify executable file
names and to read in and obtain symbol table information.

The '-file-exec-and-symbols' Command
------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -file-exec-and-symbols FILE

   Specify the executable file to be debugged.  This file is the one
from which the symbol table is also read.  If no file is specified, the
command clears the executable and symbol information.  If breakpoints
are set when using this command with no arguments, GDB will produce
error messages.  Otherwise, no output is produced, except a completion
notification.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'file'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -file-exec-and-symbols /kwikemart/marge/ezannoni/TRUNK/mbx/hello.mbx
     ^done
     (gdb)

The '-file-exec-file' Command
-----------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -file-exec-file FILE

   Specify the executable file to be debugged.  Unlike
'-file-exec-and-symbols', the symbol table is _not_ read from this file.
If used without argument, GDB clears the information about the
executable file.  No output is produced, except a completion
notification.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'exec-file'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -file-exec-file /kwikemart/marge/ezannoni/TRUNK/mbx/hello.mbx
     ^done
     (gdb)

The '-file-list-exec-source-file' Command
-----------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -file-list-exec-source-file

   List the line number, the current source file, and the absolute path
to the current source file for the current executable.  The macro
information field has a value of '1' or '0' depending on whether or not
the file includes preprocessor macro information.

GDB Command
...........

The GDB equivalent is 'info source'

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     123-file-list-exec-source-file
     123^done,line="1",file="foo.c",fullname="/home/bar/foo.c,macro-info="1"
     (gdb)

The '-file-list-exec-source-files' Command
------------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -file-list-exec-source-files

   List the source files for the current executable.

   It will always output both the filename and fullname (absolute file
name) of a source file.

GDB Command
...........

The GDB equivalent is 'info sources'.  'gdbtk' has an analogous command
'gdb_listfiles'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -file-list-exec-source-files
     ^done,files=[
     {file=foo.c,fullname=/home/foo.c},

27.23 GDB/MI Support Commands
=============================

Since new commands and features get regularly added to GDB/MI, some
commands are available to help front-ends query the debugger about
support for these capabilities.  Similarly, it is also possible to query
GDB about target support of certain features.

The '-info-gdb-mi-command' Command
----------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -info-gdb-mi-command CMD_NAME

   Query support for the GDB/MI command named CMD_NAME.

   Note that the dash ('-') starting all GDB/MI commands is technically
not part of the command name (*note GDB/MI Input Syntax::), and thus
should be omitted in CMD_NAME.  However, for ease of use, this command
also accepts the form with the leading dash.

GDB Command
...........

There is no corresponding GDB command.

Result
......

The result is a tuple.  There is currently only one field:

'exists'
     This field is equal to '"true"' if the GDB/MI command exists,
     '"false"' otherwise.

Example
.......

Here is an example where the GDB/MI command does not exist:

     -info-gdb-mi-command unsupported-command
     ^done,command={exists="false"}

And here is an example where the GDB/MI command is known to the
debugger:

     -info-gdb-mi-command symbol-list-lines
     ^done,command={exists="true"}

The '-list-features' Command
----------------------------

Returns a list of particular features of the MI protocol that this
version of gdb implements.  A feature can be a command, or a new field
in an output of some command, or even an important bugfix.  While a
frontend can sometimes detect presence of a feature at runtime, it is
easier to perform detection at debugger startup.

   The command returns a list of strings, with each string naming an
available feature.  Each returned string is just a name, it does not
have any internal structure.  The list of possible feature names is
given below.

   Example output:

     (gdb) -list-features
     ^done,result=["feature1","feature2"]

   The current list of features is:

'frozen-varobjs'
     Indicates support for the '-var-set-frozen' command, as well as
     possible presense of the 'frozen' field in the output of
     '-varobj-create'.
'pending-breakpoints'
     Indicates support for the '-f' option to the '-break-insert'
     command.
'python'
     Indicates Python scripting support, Python-based pretty-printing
     commands, and possible presence of the 'display_hint' field in the
     output of '-var-list-children'
'thread-info'
     Indicates support for the '-thread-info' command.
'data-read-memory-bytes'
     Indicates support for the '-data-read-memory-bytes' and the
     '-data-write-memory-bytes' commands.
'breakpoint-notifications'
     Indicates that changes to breakpoints and breakpoints created via
     the CLI will be announced via async records.
'ada-task-info'
     Indicates support for the '-ada-task-info' command.
'language-option'
     Indicates that all GDB/MI commands accept the '--language' option
     (*note Context management::).
'info-gdb-mi-command'
     Indicates support for the '-info-gdb-mi-command' command.
'undefined-command-error-code'
     Indicates support for the "undefined-command" error code in error
     result records, produced when trying to execute an undefined GDB/MI
     command (*note GDB/MI Result Records::).
'exec-run-start-option'
     Indicates that the '-exec-run' command supports the '--start'
     option (*note GDB/MI Program Execution::).

The '-list-target-features' Command
-----------------------------------

Returns a list of particular features that are supported by the target.
Those features affect the permitted MI commands, but unlike the features
reported by the '-list-features' command, the features depend on which
target GDB is using at the moment.  Whenever a target can change, due to
commands such as '-target-select', '-target-attach' or '-exec-run', the
list of target features may change, and the frontend should obtain it
again.  Example output:

     (gdb) -list-target-features
     ^done,result=["async"]

   The current list of features is:

'async'
     Indicates that the target is capable of asynchronous command
     execution, which means that GDB will accept further commands while
     the target is running.

'reverse'
     Indicates that the target is capable of reverse execution.  *Note
     Reverse Execution::, for more information.

27.24 Miscellaneous GDB/MI Commands
===================================

The '-gdb-exit' Command
-----------------------

Synopsis
........

      -gdb-exit

   Exit GDB immediately.

GDB Command
...........

Approximately corresponds to 'quit'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -gdb-exit
     ^exit

The '-gdb-set' Command
----------------------

Synopsis
........

      -gdb-set

   Set an internal GDB variable.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'set'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -gdb-set $foo=3
     ^done
     (gdb)

The '-gdb-show' Command
-----------------------

Synopsis
........

      -gdb-show

   Show the current value of a GDB variable.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'show'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -gdb-show annotate
     ^done,value="0"
     (gdb)

The '-gdb-version' Command
--------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -gdb-version

   Show version information for GDB.  Used mostly in testing.

GDB Command
...........

The GDB equivalent is 'show version'.  GDB by default shows this
information when you start an interactive session.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -gdb-version
     ~GNU gdb 5.2.1
     ~Copyright 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     ~GDB is free software, covered by the GNU General Public License, and
     ~you are welcome to change it and/or distribute copies of it under
     ~ certain conditions.
     ~Type "show copying" to see the conditions.
     ~There is absolutely no warranty for GDB.  Type "show warranty" for
     ~ details.
     ~This GDB was configured as
      "--host=sparc-sun-solaris2.5.1 --target=ppc-eabi".
     ^done
     (gdb)

The '-list-thread-groups' Command
---------------------------------

Synopsis
--------

     -list-thread-groups [ --available ] [ --recurse 1 ] [ GROUP ... ]

   Lists thread groups (*note Thread groups::).  When a single thread
group is passed as the argument, lists the children of that group.  When
several thread group are passed, lists information about those thread
groups.  Without any parameters, lists information about all top-level
thread groups.

   Normally, thread groups that are being debugged are reported.  With
the '--available' option, GDB reports thread groups available on the
target.

   The output of this command may have either a 'threads' result or a
'groups' result.  The 'thread' result has a list of tuples as value,
with each tuple describing a thread (*note GDB/MI Thread Information::).
The 'groups' result has a list of tuples as value, each tuple describing
a thread group.  If top-level groups are requested (that is, no
parameter is passed), or when several groups are passed, the output
always has a 'groups' result.  The format of the 'group' result is
described below.

   To reduce the number of roundtrips it's possible to list thread
groups together with their children, by passing the '--recurse' option
and the recursion depth.  Presently, only recursion depth of 1 is
permitted.  If this option is present, then every reported thread group
will also include its children, either as 'group' or 'threads' field.

   In general, any combination of option and parameters is permitted,
with the following caveats:

   * When a single thread group is passed, the output will typically be
     the 'threads' result.  Because threads may not contain anything,
     the 'recurse' option will be ignored.

   * When the '--available' option is passed, limited information may be
     available.  In particular, the list of threads of a process might
     be inaccessible.  Further, specifying specific thread groups might
     not give any performance advantage over listing all thread groups.
     The frontend should assume that '-list-thread-groups --available'
     is always an expensive operation and cache the results.

   The 'groups' result is a list of tuples, where each tuple may have
the following fields:

'id'
     Identifier of the thread group.  This field is always present.  The
     identifier is an opaque string; frontends should not try to convert
     it to an integer, even though it might look like one.

'type'
     The type of the thread group.  At present, only 'process' is a
     valid type.

'pid'
     The target-specific process identifier.  This field is only present
     for thread groups of type 'process' and only if the process exists.

'num_children'
     The number of children this thread group has.  This field may be
     absent for an available thread group.

'threads'
     This field has a list of tuples as value, each tuple describing a
     thread.  It may be present if the '--recurse' option is specified,
     and it's actually possible to obtain the threads.

'cores'
     This field is a list of integers, each identifying a core that one
     thread of the group is running on.  This field may be absent if
     such information is not available.

'executable'
     The name of the executable file that corresponds to this thread
     group.  The field is only present for thread groups of type
     'process', and only if there is a corresponding executable file.

Example
-------

     gdb
     -list-thread-groups
     ^done,groups=[{id="17",type="process",pid="yyy",num_children="2"}]
     -list-thread-groups 17
     ^done,threads=[{id="2",target-id="Thread 0xb7e14b90 (LWP 21257)",

                file="/tmp/a.c",fullname="/tmp/a.c",line="158"},state="running"}]]
     -list-thread-groups --available

                             {id="2",target-id="Thread 0xb7e14b90",cores=[2]}]},...]

The '-info-os' Command
----------------------

Synopsis
........

     -info-os [ TYPE ]

   If no argument is supplied, the command returns a table of available
operating-system-specific information types.  If one of these types is
supplied as an argument TYPE, then the command returns a table of data
of that type.

   The types of information available depend on the target operating
system.

   (Note that the MI output here includes a '"Title"' column that does
not appear in command-line 'info os'; this column is useful for MI
clients that want to enumerate the types of data, such as in a popup
menu, but is needless clutter on the command line, and 'info os' omits
it.)

The '-add-inferior' Command
---------------------------

Synopsis
--------

     -add-inferior

   Creates a new inferior (*note Inferiors and Programs::).  The created
inferior is not associated with any executable.  Such association may be
established with the '-file-exec-and-symbols' command (*note GDB/MI File
Commands::).  The command response has a single field, 'inferior', whose
value is the identifier of the thread group corresponding to the new
inferior.

Example
-------

     gdb
     -add-inferior
     ^done,inferior="i3"

The '-interpreter-exec' Command
-------------------------------

Synopsis
--------

     -interpreter-exec INTERPRETER COMMAND

   Execute the specified COMMAND in the given INTERPRETER.

GDB Command
-----------

The corresponding GDB command is 'interpreter-exec'.

Example
-------

     (gdb)
     -interpreter-exec console "break main"
     &"During symbol reading, couldn't parse type; debugger out of date?.\n"
     &"During symbol reading, bad structure-type format.\n"
     ~"Breakpoint 1 at 0x8074fc6: file ../../src/gdb/main.c, line 743.\n"
     ^done
     (gdb)

The '-inferior-tty-set' Command
-------------------------------

Synopsis
--------

     -inferior-tty-set /dev/pts/1

   Set terminal for future runs of the program being debugged.

GDB Command
-----------

The corresponding GDB command is 'set inferior-tty' /dev/pts/1.

Example
-------

     (gdb)
     -inferior-tty-set /dev/pts/1
     ^done
     (gdb)

The '-inferior-tty-show' Command
--------------------------------

Synopsis
--------

     -inferior-tty-show

   Show terminal for future runs of program being debugged.

GDB Command
-----------

The corresponding GDB command is 'show inferior-tty'.

Example
-------

     (gdb)
     -inferior-tty-set /dev/pts/1
     ^done
     (gdb)
     -inferior-tty-show
     ^done,inferior_tty_terminal="/dev/pts/1"
     (gdb)

The '-enable-timings' Command
-----------------------------

Synopsis
--------

     -enable-timings [yes | no]

   Toggle the printing of the wallclock, user and system times for an MI
command as a field in its output.  This command is to help frontend
developers optimize the performance of their code.  No argument is
equivalent to 'yes'.

GDB Command
-----------

No equivalent.

Example
-------

     (gdb)
     -enable-timings
     ^done
     (gdb)
     -break-insert main
     ^done,bkpt={number="1",type="breakpoint",disp="keep",enabled="y",
     addr="0x080484ed",func="main",file="myprog.c",
     fullname="/home/nickrob/myprog.c",line="73",thread-groups=["i1"],
     times="0"},
     time={wallclock="0.05185",user="0.00800",system="0.00000"}
     (gdb)
     -enable-timings no
     ^done
     (gdb)
     -exec-run
     ^running
     (gdb)
     *stopped,reason="breakpoint-hit",disp="keep",bkptno="1",thread-id="0",
     frame={addr="0x080484ed",func="main",args=[{name="argc",value="1"},
     {name="argv",value="0xbfb60364"}],file="myprog.c",
     fullname="/home/nickrob/myprog.c",line="73"}

28 GDB Annotations
******************

This chapter describes annotations in GDB.  Annotations were designed to
interface GDB to graphical user interfaces or other similar programs
which want to interact with GDB at a relatively high level.

   The annotation mechanism has largely been superseded by GDB/MI (*note
GDB/MI::).

* Menu:

* Annotations Overview::  What annotations are; the general syntax.
* Server Prefix::       Issuing a command without affecting user state.
* Prompting::           Annotations marking GDB's need for input.
* Errors::              Annotations for error messages.
* Invalidation::        Some annotations describe things now invalid.
* Annotations for Running::
                        Whether the program is running, how it stopped, etc.
* Source Annotations::  Annotations describing source code.

28.1 What is an Annotation?
===========================

Annotations start with a newline character, two 'control-z' characters,
and the name of the annotation.  If there is no additional information
associated with this annotation, the name of the annotation is followed
immediately by a newline.  If there is additional information, the name
of the annotation is followed by a space, the additional information,
and a newline.  The additional information cannot contain newline
characters.

   Any output not beginning with a newline and two 'control-z'
characters denotes literal output from GDB.  Currently there is no need
for GDB to output a newline followed by two 'control-z' characters, but
if there was such a need, the annotations could be extended with an
'escape' annotation which means those three characters as output.

   The annotation LEVEL, which is specified using the '--annotate'
command line option (*note Mode Options::), controls how much
information GDB prints together with its prompt, values of expressions,
source lines, and other types of output.  Level 0 is for no annotations,
level 1 is for use when GDB is run as a subprocess of GNU Emacs, level 3
is the maximum annotation suitable for programs that control GDB, and
level 2 annotations have been made obsolete (*note Limitations of the
Annotation Interface: (annotate)Limitations.).

'set annotate LEVEL'
     The GDB command 'set annotate' sets the level of annotations to the
     specified LEVEL.

'show annotate'
     Show the current annotation level.

   This chapter describes level 3 annotations.

   A simple example of starting up GDB with annotations is:

     $ gdb --annotate=3
     GNU gdb 6.0
     Copyright 2003 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     GDB is free software, covered by the GNU General Public License,

     This GDB was configured as "i386-pc-linux-gnu"

     ^Z^Zpre-prompt
     (gdb)
     ^Z^Zprompt
     quit

     ^Z^Zpost-prompt
     $

   Here 'quit' is input to GDB; the rest is output from GDB.  The three
lines beginning '^Z^Z' (where '^Z' denotes a 'control-z' character) are
annotations; the rest is output from GDB.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Server Prefix,  Next: Prompting,  Prev: Annotations Overview,  Up: Annotations

28.2 The Server Prefix
======================

If you prefix a command with 'server ' then it will not affect the
command history, nor will it affect GDB's notion of which command to
repeat if <RET> is pressed on a line by itself.  This means that
commands can be run behind a user's back by a front-end in a transparent
manner.

   The 'server ' prefix does not affect the recording of values into the
value history; to print a value without recording it into the value
history, use the 'output' command instead of the 'print' command.

   Using this prefix also disables confirmation requests (*note
confirmation requests::).
