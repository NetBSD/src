position, and "mark" refers to a cursor position saved by the 'set-mark'
command.  The text between the point and mark is referred to as the
"region".


File: gdb.info,  Node: Commands For Moving,  Next: Commands For History,  Up: Bindable Readline Commands

32.4.1 Commands For Moving
--------------------------

'beginning-of-line (C-a)'
     Move to the start of the current line.

'end-of-line (C-e)'
     Move to the end of the line.

'forward-char (C-f)'
     Move forward a character.

'backward-char (C-b)'
     Move back a character.

'forward-word (M-f)'
     Move forward to the end of the next word.  Words are composed of
     letters and digits.

'backward-word (M-b)'
     Move back to the start of the current or previous word.  Words are
     composed of letters and digits.

'clear-screen (C-l)'
     Clear the screen and redraw the current line, leaving the current
     line at the top of the screen.

'redraw-current-line ()'
     Refresh the current line.  By default, this is unbound.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Commands For History,  Next: Commands For Text,  Prev: Commands For Moving,  Up: Bindable Readline Commands

32.4.2 Commands For Manipulating The History
--------------------------------------------

'accept-line (Newline or Return)'
     Accept the line regardless of where the cursor is.  If this line is
     non-empty, it may be added to the history list for future recall
     with 'add_history()'.  If this line is a modified history line, the
     history line is restored to its original state.

'previous-history (C-p)'
     Move 'back' through the history list, fetching the previous
     command.

'next-history (C-n)'
     Move 'forward' through the history list, fetching the next command.

'beginning-of-history (M-<)'
     Move to the first line in the history.

'end-of-history (M->)'
     Move to the end of the input history, i.e., the line currently
     being entered.

'reverse-search-history (C-r)'
     Search backward starting at the current line and moving 'up'
     through the history as necessary.  This is an incremental search.

'forward-search-history (C-s)'
     Search forward starting at the current line and moving 'down'
     through the the history as necessary.  This is an incremental
     search.

'non-incremental-reverse-search-history (M-p)'
     Search backward starting at the current line and moving 'up'
     through the history as necessary using a non-incremental search for
     a string supplied by the user.

'non-incremental-forward-search-history (M-n)'
     Search forward starting at the current line and moving 'down'
     through the the history as necessary using a non-incremental search
     for a string supplied by the user.

'history-search-forward ()'
     Search forward through the history for the string of characters
     between the start of the current line and the point.  This is a
     non-incremental search.  By default, this command is unbound.

'history-search-backward ()'
     Search backward through the history for the string of characters
     between the start of the current line and the point.  This is a
     non-incremental search.  By default, this command is unbound.

'yank-nth-arg (M-C-y)'
     Insert the first argument to the previous command (usually the
     second word on the previous line) at point.  With an argument N,
     insert the Nth word from the previous command (the words in the
     previous command begin with word 0).  A negative argument inserts
     the Nth word from the end of the previous command.  Once the
     argument N is computed, the argument is extracted as if the '!N'
     history expansion had been specified.

'yank-last-arg (M-. or M-_)'
     Insert last argument to the previous command (the last word of the
     previous history entry).  With a numeric argument, behave exactly
     like 'yank-nth-arg'.  Successive calls to 'yank-last-arg' move back
     through the history list, inserting the last word (or the word
     specified by the argument to the first call) of each line in turn.
     Any numeric argument supplied to these successive calls determines
     the direction to move through the history.  A negative argument
     switches the direction through the history (back or forward).  The
     history expansion facilities are used to extract the last argument,
     as if the '!$' history expansion had been specified.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Commands For Text,  Next: Commands For Killing,  Prev: Commands For History,  Up: Bindable Readline Commands

32.4.3 Commands For Changing Text
---------------------------------

'delete-char (C-d)'
     Delete the character at point.  If point is at the beginning of the
     line, there are no characters in the line, and the last character
     typed was not bound to 'delete-char', then return EOF.

'backward-delete-char (Rubout)'
     Delete the character behind the cursor.  A numeric argument means
     to kill the characters instead of deleting them.

'forward-backward-delete-char ()'
     Delete the character under the cursor, unless the cursor is at the
     end of the line, in which case the character behind the cursor is
     deleted.  By default, this is not bound to a key.

'quoted-insert (C-q or C-v)'
     Add the next character typed to the line verbatim.  This is how to
     insert key sequences like 'C-q', for example.

'tab-insert (M-<TAB>)'
     Insert a tab character.

'self-insert (a, b, A, 1, !, ...)'
     Insert yourself.

'transpose-chars (C-t)'
     Drag the character before the cursor forward over the character at
     the cursor, moving the cursor forward as well.  If the insertion
     point is at the end of the line, then this transposes the last two
     characters of the line.  Negative arguments have no effect.

'transpose-words (M-t)'
     Drag the word before point past the word after point, moving point
     past that word as well.  If the insertion point is at the end of
     the line, this transposes the last two words on the line.

'upcase-word (M-u)'
     Uppercase the current (or following) word.  With a negative
     argument, uppercase the previous word, but do not move the cursor.

'downcase-word (M-l)'
     Lowercase the current (or following) word.  With a negative
     argument, lowercase the previous word, but do not move the cursor.

'capitalize-word (M-c)'
     Capitalize the current (or following) word.  With a negative
     argument, capitalize the previous word, but do not move the cursor.

'overwrite-mode ()'
     Toggle overwrite mode.  With an explicit positive numeric argument,
     switches to overwrite mode.  With an explicit non-positive numeric
     argument, switches to insert mode.  This command affects only
     'emacs' mode; 'vi' mode does overwrite differently.  Each call to
     'readline()' starts in insert mode.

     In overwrite mode, characters bound to 'self-insert' replace the
     text at point rather than pushing the text to the right.
     Characters bound to 'backward-delete-char' replace the character
     before point with a space.

     By default, this command is unbound.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Commands For Killing,  Next: Numeric Arguments,  Prev: Commands For Text,  Up: Bindable Readline Commands

32.4.4 Killing And Yanking
--------------------------

'kill-line (C-k)'
     Kill the text from point to the end of the line.

'backward-kill-line (C-x Rubout)'
     Kill backward to the beginning of the line.

'unix-line-discard (C-u)'
     Kill backward from the cursor to the beginning of the current line.

'kill-whole-line ()'
     Kill all characters on the current line, no matter where point is.
     By default, this is unbound.

'kill-word (M-d)'
     Kill from point to the end of the current word, or if between
     words, to the end of the next word.  Word boundaries are the same
     as 'forward-word'.

'backward-kill-word (M-<DEL>)'
     Kill the word behind point.  Word boundaries are the same as
     'backward-word'.

'unix-word-rubout (C-w)'
     Kill the word behind point, using white space as a word boundary.
     The killed text is saved on the kill-ring.

'unix-filename-rubout ()'
     Kill the word behind point, using white space and the slash
     character as the word boundaries.  The killed text is saved on the
     kill-ring.

'delete-horizontal-space ()'
     Delete all spaces and tabs around point.  By default, this is
     unbound.

'kill-region ()'
     Kill the text in the current region.  By default, this command is
     unbound.

'copy-region-as-kill ()'
     Copy the text in the region to the kill buffer, so it can be yanked
     right away.  By default, this command is unbound.

'copy-backward-word ()'
     Copy the word before point to the kill buffer.  The word boundaries
     are the same as 'backward-word'.  By default, this command is
     unbound.

'copy-forward-word ()'
     Copy the word following point to the kill buffer.  The word
     boundaries are the same as 'forward-word'.  By default, this
     command is unbound.

'yank (C-y)'
     Yank the top of the kill ring into the buffer at point.

'yank-pop (M-y)'
     Rotate the kill-ring, and yank the new top.  You can only do this
     if the prior command is 'yank' or 'yank-pop'.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Numeric Arguments,  Next: Commands For Completion,  Prev: Commands For Killing,  Up: Bindable Readline Commands

32.4.5 Specifying Numeric Arguments
-----------------------------------

'digit-argument (M-0, M-1, ... M--)'
     Add this digit to the argument already accumulating, or start a new
     argument.  'M--' starts a negative argument.

'universal-argument ()'
     This is another way to specify an argument.  If this command is
     followed by one or more digits, optionally with a leading minus
     sign, those digits define the argument.  If the command is followed
     by digits, executing 'universal-argument' again ends the numeric
     argument, but is otherwise ignored.  As a special case, if this
     command is immediately followed by a character that is neither a
     digit or minus sign, the argument count for the next command is
     multiplied by four.  The argument count is initially one, so
     executing this function the first time makes the argument count
     four, a second time makes the argument count sixteen, and so on.
     By default, this is not bound to a key.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Commands For Completion,  Next: Keyboard Macros,  Prev: Numeric Arguments,  Up: Bindable Readline Commands

32.4.6 Letting Readline Type For You
------------------------------------

'complete (<TAB>)'
     Attempt to perform completion on the text before point.  The actual
     completion performed is application-specific.  The default is
     filename completion.

'possible-completions (M-?)'
     List the possible completions of the text before point.  When
     displaying completions, Readline sets the number of columns used
     for display to the value of 'completion-display-width', the value
     of the environment variable 'COLUMNS', or the screen width, in that
     order.

'insert-completions (M-*)'
     Insert all completions of the text before point that would have
     been generated by 'possible-completions'.

'menu-complete ()'
     Similar to 'complete', but replaces the word to be completed with a
     single match from the list of possible completions.  Repeated
     execution of 'menu-complete' steps through the list of possible
     completions, inserting each match in turn.  At the end of the list
     of completions, the bell is rung (subject to the setting of
     'bell-style') and the original text is restored.  An argument of N
     moves N positions forward in the list of matches; a negative
     argument may be used to move backward through the list.  This
     command is intended to be bound to <TAB>, but is unbound by
     default.

'menu-complete-backward ()'
     Identical to 'menu-complete', but moves backward through the list
     of possible completions, as if 'menu-complete' had been given a
     negative argument.

'delete-char-or-list ()'
     Deletes the character under the cursor if not at the beginning or
     end of the line (like 'delete-char').  If at the end of the line,
     behaves identically to 'possible-completions'.  This command is
     unbound by default.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Keyboard Macros,  Next: Miscellaneous Commands,  Prev: Commands For Completion,  Up: Bindable Readline Commands

32.4.7 Keyboard Macros
----------------------

'start-kbd-macro (C-x ()'
     Begin saving the characters typed into the current keyboard macro.

'end-kbd-macro (C-x ))'
     Stop saving the characters typed into the current keyboard macro
     and save the definition.

'call-last-kbd-macro (C-x e)'
     Re-execute the last keyboard macro defined, by making the
     characters in the macro appear as if typed at the keyboard.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Miscellaneous Commands,  Prev: Keyboard Macros,  Up: Bindable Readline Commands

32.4.8 Some Miscellaneous Commands
----------------------------------

're-read-init-file (C-x C-r)'
     Read in the contents of the INPUTRC file, and incorporate any
     bindings or variable assignments found there.

'abort (C-g)'
     Abort the current editing command and ring the terminal's bell
     (subject to the setting of 'bell-style').

'do-uppercase-version (M-a, M-b, M-X, ...)'
     If the metafied character X is lowercase, run the command that is
     bound to the corresponding uppercase character.

'prefix-meta (<ESC>)'
     Metafy the next character typed.  This is for keyboards without a
     meta key.  Typing '<ESC> f' is equivalent to typing 'M-f'.

'undo (C-_ or C-x C-u)'
     Incremental undo, separately remembered for each line.

'revert-line (M-r)'
     Undo all changes made to this line.  This is like executing the
     'undo' command enough times to get back to the beginning.

'tilde-expand (M-~)'
     Perform tilde expansion on the current word.

'set-mark (C-@)'
     Set the mark to the point.  If a numeric argument is supplied, the
     mark is set to that position.

'exchange-point-and-mark (C-x C-x)'
     Swap the point with the mark.  The current cursor position is set
     to the saved position, and the old cursor position is saved as the
     mark.

'character-search (C-])'
     A character is read and point is moved to the next occurrence of
     that character.  A negative count searches for previous
     occurrences.

'character-search-backward (M-C-])'
     A character is read and point is moved to the previous occurrence
     of that character.  A negative count searches for subsequent
     occurrences.

'skip-csi-sequence ()'
     Read enough characters to consume a multi-key sequence such as
     those defined for keys like Home and End.  Such sequences begin
     with a Control Sequence Indicator (CSI), usually ESC-[.  If this
     sequence is bound to "\e[", keys producing such sequences will have
     no effect unless explicitly bound to a readline command, instead of
     inserting stray characters into the editing buffer.  This is
     unbound by default, but usually bound to ESC-[.

'insert-comment (M-#)'
     Without a numeric argument, the value of the 'comment-begin'
     variable is inserted at the beginning of the current line.  If a
     numeric argument is supplied, this command acts as a toggle: if the
     characters at the beginning of the line do not match the value of
     'comment-begin', the value is inserted, otherwise the characters in
     'comment-begin' are deleted from the beginning of the line.  In
     either case, the line is accepted as if a newline had been typed.

'dump-functions ()'
     Print all of the functions and their key bindings to the Readline
     output stream.  If a numeric argument is supplied, the output is
     formatted in such a way that it can be made part of an INPUTRC
     file.  This command is unbound by default.

'dump-variables ()'
     Print all of the settable variables and their values to the
     Readline output stream.  If a numeric argument is supplied, the
     output is formatted in such a way that it can be made part of an
     INPUTRC file.  This command is unbound by default.

'dump-macros ()'
     Print all of the Readline key sequences bound to macros and the
     strings they output.  If a numeric argument is supplied, the output
     is formatted in such a way that it can be made part of an INPUTRC
     file.  This command is unbound by default.

'emacs-editing-mode (C-e)'
     When in 'vi' command mode, this causes a switch to 'emacs' editing
     mode.

'vi-editing-mode (M-C-j)'
     When in 'emacs' editing mode, this causes a switch to 'vi' editing
     mode.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Readline vi Mode,  Prev: Bindable Readline Commands,  Up: Command Line Editing

32.5 Readline vi Mode
=====================

While the Readline library does not have a full set of 'vi' editing
functions, it does contain enough to allow simple editing of the line.
The Readline 'vi' mode behaves as specified in the POSIX standard.

   In order to switch interactively between 'emacs' and 'vi' editing
modes, use the command 'M-C-j' (bound to emacs-editing-mode when in 'vi'
mode and to vi-editing-mode in 'emacs' mode).  The Readline default is
'emacs' mode.

   When you enter a line in 'vi' mode, you are already placed in
'insertion' mode, as if you had typed an 'i'.  Pressing <ESC> switches
you into 'command' mode, where you can edit the text of the line with
the standard 'vi' movement keys, move to previous history lines with 'k'
and subsequent lines with 'j', and so forth.

33 Using History Interactively
******************************

This chapter describes how to use the GNU History Library interactively,
from a user's standpoint.  It should be considered a user's guide.  For
information on using the GNU History Library in your own programs, *note

File: gdb.info,  Node: History Interaction,  Up: Using History Interactively

33.1 History Expansion
======================

The History library provides a history expansion feature that is similar
to the history expansion provided by 'csh'.  This section describes the
syntax used to manipulate the history information.

   History expansions introduce words from the history list into the
input stream, making it easy to repeat commands, insert the arguments to
a previous command into the current input line, or fix errors in
previous commands quickly.

   History expansion takes place in two parts.  The first is to
determine which line from the history list should be used during
substitution.  The second is to select portions of that line for
inclusion into the current one.  The line selected from the history is
called the "event", and the portions of that line that are acted upon
are called "words".  Various "modifiers" are available to manipulate the
selected words.  The line is broken into words in the same fashion that
Bash does, so that several words surrounded by quotes are considered one
word.  History expansions are introduced by the appearance of the
history expansion character, which is '!' by default.

33.1.1 Event Designators
------------------------

An event designator is a reference to a command line entry in the
history list.  Unless the reference is absolute, events are relative to
the current position in the history list.

'!'
     Start a history substitution, except when followed by a space, tab,
     the end of the line, or '='.

'!N'
     Refer to command line N.

'!-N'
     Refer to the command N lines back.

'!!'
     Refer to the previous command.  This is a synonym for '!-1'.

'!STRING'
     Refer to the most recent command preceding the current position in
     the history list starting with STRING.

'!?STRING[?]'
     Refer to the most recent command preceding the current position in
     the history list containing STRING.  The trailing '?' may be
     omitted if the STRING is followed immediately by a newline.

'^STRING1^STRING2^'
     Quick Substitution.  Repeat the last command, replacing STRING1
     with STRING2.  Equivalent to '!!:s/STRING1/STRING2/'.

'!#'
     The entire command line typed so far.

33.1.2 Word Designators
-----------------------

Word designators are used to select desired words from the event.  A ':'
separates the event specification from the word designator.  It may be
omitted if the word designator begins with a '^', '$', '*', '-', or '%'.
Words are numbered from the beginning of the line, with the first word
being denoted by 0 (zero).  Words are inserted into the current line
separated by single spaces.

   For example,

'!!'
     designates the preceding command.  When you type this, the
     preceding command is repeated in toto.

'!!:$'
     designates the last argument of the preceding command.  This may be
     shortened to '!$'.

'!fi:2'
     designates the second argument of the most recent command starting
     with the letters 'fi'.

   Here are the word designators:

'0 (zero)'
     The '0'th word.  For many applications, this is the command word.

'N'
     The Nth word.

'^'
     The first argument; that is, word 1.

'$'
     The last argument.

'%'
     The word matched by the most recent '?STRING?' search.

'X-Y'
     A range of words; '-Y' abbreviates '0-Y'.

'*'
     All of the words, except the '0'th.  This is a synonym for '1-$'.
     It is not an error to use '*' if there is just one word in the
     event; the empty string is returned in that case.

'X*'
     Abbreviates 'X-$'

'X-'
     Abbreviates 'X-$' like 'X*', but omits the last word.

   If a word designator is supplied without an event specification, the
previous command is used as the event.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Modifiers,  Prev: Word Designators,  Up: History Interaction

33.1.3 Modifiers
----------------

After the optional word designator, you can add a sequence of one or
more of the following modifiers, each preceded by a ':'.

'h'
     Remove a trailing pathname component, leaving only the head.

't'
     Remove all leading pathname components, leaving the tail.

'r'
     Remove a trailing suffix of the form '.SUFFIX', leaving the
     basename.

'e'
     Remove all but the trailing suffix.

'p'
     Print the new command but do not execute it.

's/OLD/NEW/'
     Substitute NEW for the first occurrence of OLD in the event line.
     Any delimiter may be used in place of '/'.  The delimiter may be
     quoted in OLD and NEW with a single backslash.  If '&' appears in
     NEW, it is replaced by OLD.  A single backslash will quote the '&'.
     The final delimiter is optional if it is the last character on the
     input line.

'&'
     Repeat the previous substitution.

'g'
'a'
     Cause changes to be applied over the entire event line.  Used in
     conjunction with 's', as in 'gs/OLD/NEW/', or with '&'.

'G'
     Apply the following 's' modifier once to each word in the event.

Appendix A In Memoriam
**********************

The GDB project mourns the loss of the following long-time contributors:

'Fred Fish'
     Fred was a long-standing contributor to GDB (1991-2006), and to
     Free Software in general.  Outside of GDB, he was known in the
     Amiga world for his series of Fish Disks, and the GeekGadget
     project.

'Michael Snyder'
     Michael was one of the Global Maintainers of the GDB project, with
     contributions recorded as early as 1996, until 2011.  In addition
     to his day to day participation, he was a large driving force
     behind adding Reverse Debugging to GDB.

   Beyond their technical contributions to the project, they were also
enjoyable members of the Free Software Community.  We will miss them.

Appendix B Formatting Documentation
***********************************

The GDB 4 release includes an already-formatted reference card, ready
for printing with PostScript or Ghostscript, in the 'gdb' subdirectory
of the main source directory(1).  If you can use PostScript or
Ghostscript with your printer, you can print the reference card
immediately with 'refcard.ps'.

   The release also includes the source for the reference card.  You can
format it, using TeX, by typing:

     make refcard.dvi

   The GDB reference card is designed to print in "landscape" mode on US
"letter" size paper; that is, on a sheet 11 inches wide by 8.5 inches
high.  You will need to specify this form of printing as an option to
your DVI output program.

   All the documentation for GDB comes as part of the machine-readable
distribution.  The documentation is written in Texinfo format, which is
a documentation system that uses a single source file to produce both
on-line information and a printed manual.  You can use one of the Info
formatting commands to create the on-line version of the documentation
and TeX (or 'texi2roff') to typeset the printed version.

   GDB includes an already formatted copy of the on-line Info version of
this manual in the 'gdb' subdirectory.  The main Info file is
'gdb-8.0.1/gdb/gdb.info', and it refers to subordinate files matching
'gdb.info*' in the same directory.  If necessary, you can print out
these files, or read them with any editor; but they are easier to read
using the 'info' subsystem in GNU Emacs or the standalone 'info'
program, available as part of the GNU Texinfo distribution.

   If you want to format these Info files yourself, you need one of the
Info formatting programs, such as 'texinfo-format-buffer' or 'makeinfo'.

   If you have 'makeinfo' installed, and are in the top level GDB source
directory ('gdb-8.0.1', in the case of version 8.0.1), you can make the
Info file by typing:

     cd gdb
     make gdb.info

   If you want to typeset and print copies of this manual, you need TeX,
a program to print its DVI output files, and 'texinfo.tex', the Texinfo
definitions file.

   TeX is a typesetting program; it does not print files directly, but
produces output files called DVI files.  To print a typeset document,
you need a program to print DVI files.  If your system has TeX
installed, chances are it has such a program.  The precise command to
use depends on your system; 'lpr -d' is common; another (for PostScript
devices) is 'dvips'.  The DVI print command may require a file name
without any extension or a '.dvi' extension.

   TeX also requires a macro definitions file called 'texinfo.tex'.
This file tells TeX how to typeset a document written in Texinfo format.
On its own, TeX cannot either read or typeset a Texinfo file.
'texinfo.tex' is distributed with GDB and is located in the
'gdb-VERSION-NUMBER/texinfo' directory.

   If you have TeX and a DVI printer program installed, you can typeset
and print this manual.  First switch to the 'gdb' subdirectory of the
main source directory (for example, to 'gdb-8.0.1/gdb') and type:

     make gdb.dvi

   Then give 'gdb.dvi' to your DVI printing program.

File: gdb.info,  Node: Requirements,  Next: Running Configure,  Up: Installing GDB

C.1 Requirements for Building GDB
=================================

Building GDB requires various tools and packages to be available.  Other
packages will be used only if they are found.

Tools/Packages Necessary for Building GDB
=========================================

ISO C90 compiler
     GDB is written in ISO C90.  It should be buildable with any working
     C90 compiler, e.g. GCC.

Tools/Packages Optional for Building GDB
========================================

Expat
     GDB can use the Expat XML parsing library.  This library may be
     included with your operating system distribution; if it is not, you
     can get the latest version from <http://expat.sourceforge.net>.
     The 'configure' script will search for this library in several
     standard locations; if it is installed in an unusual path, you can
     use the '--with-libexpat-prefix' option to specify its location.

     Expat is used for:

        * Remote protocol memory maps (*note Memory Map Format::)
        * Target descriptions (*note Target Descriptions::)
        * Remote shared library lists (*Note Library List Format::, or
          alternatively *note Library List Format for SVR4 Targets::)
        * MS-Windows shared libraries (*note Shared Libraries::)
        * Traceframe info (*note Traceframe Info Format::)
        * Branch trace (*note Branch Trace Format::, *note Branch Trace
          Configuration Format::)

zlib
     GDB will use the 'zlib' library, if available, to read compressed
     debug sections.  Some linkers, such as GNU gold, are capable of
     producing binaries with compressed debug sections.  If GDB is
     compiled with 'zlib', it will be able to read the debug information
     in such binaries.

     The 'zlib' library is likely included with your operating system
     distribution; if it is not, you can get the latest version from
     <http://zlib.net>.

iconv
     GDB's features related to character sets (*note Character Sets::)
     require a functioning 'iconv' implementation.  If you are on a GNU
     system, then this is provided by the GNU C Library.  Some other
     systems also provide a working 'iconv'.

     If GDB is using the 'iconv' program which is installed in a
     non-standard place, you will need to tell GDB where to find it.
     This is done with '--with-iconv-bin' which specifies the directory
     that contains the 'iconv' program.

     On systems without 'iconv', you can install GNU Libiconv.  If you
     have previously installed Libiconv, you can use the
     '--with-libiconv-prefix' option to configure.

     GDB's top-level 'configure' and 'Makefile' will arrange to build
     Libiconv if a directory named 'libiconv' appears in the top-most
     source directory.  If Libiconv is built this way, and if the
     operating system does not provide a suitable 'iconv'
     implementation, then the just-built library will automatically be
     used by GDB.  One easy way to set this up is to download GNU
     Libiconv, unpack it, and then rename the directory holding the
     Libiconv source code to 'libiconv'.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Running Configure,  Next: Separate Objdir,  Prev: Requirements,  Up: Installing GDB

C.2 Invoking the GDB 'configure' Script
=======================================

GDB comes with a 'configure' script that automates the process of
preparing GDB for installation; you can then use 'make' to build the
'gdb' program.

   The GDB distribution includes all the source code you need for GDB in
a single directory, whose name is usually composed by appending the
version number to 'gdb'.

   For example, the GDB version 8.0.1 distribution is in the 'gdb-8.0.1'
directory.  That directory contains:

'gdb-8.0.1/configure (and supporting files)'
     script for configuring GDB and all its supporting libraries

'gdb-8.0.1/gdb'
     the source specific to GDB itself

'gdb-8.0.1/bfd'
     source for the Binary File Descriptor library

'gdb-8.0.1/include'
     GNU include files

'gdb-8.0.1/libiberty'
     source for the '-liberty' free software library

'gdb-8.0.1/opcodes'
     source for the library of opcode tables and disassemblers

'gdb-8.0.1/readline'
     source for the GNU command-line interface

'gdb-8.0.1/glob'
     source for the GNU filename pattern-matching subroutine

'gdb-8.0.1/mmalloc'
     source for the GNU memory-mapped malloc package

   The simplest way to configure and build GDB is to run 'configure'
from the 'gdb-VERSION-NUMBER' source directory, which in this example is
the 'gdb-8.0.1' directory.

   First switch to the 'gdb-VERSION-NUMBER' source directory if you are
not already in it; then run 'configure'.  Pass the identifier for the
platform on which GDB will run as an argument.

   For example:

     cd gdb-8.0.1
     ./configure HOST
     make

where HOST is an identifier such as 'sun4' or 'decstation', that
identifies the platform where GDB will run.  (You can often leave off
HOST; 'configure' tries to guess the correct value by examining your
system.)

   Running 'configure HOST' and then running 'make' builds the 'bfd',
'readline', 'mmalloc', and 'libiberty' libraries, then 'gdb' itself.
The configured source files, and the binaries, are left in the
corresponding source directories.

   'configure' is a Bourne-shell ('/bin/sh') script; if your system does
not recognize this automatically when you run a different shell, you may
need to run 'sh' on it explicitly:

     sh configure HOST

   If you run 'configure' from a directory that contains source
directories for multiple libraries or programs, such as the 'gdb-8.0.1'
source directory for version 8.0.1, 'configure' creates configuration
files for every directory level underneath (unless you tell it not to,
with the '--norecursion' option).

   You should run the 'configure' script from the top directory in the
source tree, the 'gdb-VERSION-NUMBER' directory.  If you run 'configure'
from one of the subdirectories, you will configure only that
subdirectory.  That is usually not what you want.  In particular, if you
run the first 'configure' from the 'gdb' subdirectory of the
'gdb-VERSION-NUMBER' directory, you will omit the configuration of
'bfd', 'readline', and other sibling directories of the 'gdb'
subdirectory.  This leads to build errors about missing include files
such as 'bfd/bfd.h'.

   You can install 'gdb' anywhere; it has no hardwired paths.  However,
you should make sure that the shell on your path (named by the 'SHELL'
environment variable) is publicly readable.  Remember that GDB uses the
shell to start your program--some systems refuse to let GDB debug child
processes whose programs are not readable.

C.3 Compiling GDB in Another Directory
======================================

If you want to run GDB versions for several host or target machines, you
need a different 'gdb' compiled for each combination of host and target.
'configure' is designed to make this easy by allowing you to generate
each configuration in a separate subdirectory, rather than in the source
directory.  If your 'make' program handles the 'VPATH' feature (GNU
'make' does), running 'make' in each of these directories builds the
'gdb' program specified there.

   To build 'gdb' in a separate directory, run 'configure' with the
'--srcdir' option to specify where to find the source.  (You also need
to specify a path to find 'configure' itself from your working
directory.  If the path to 'configure' would be the same as the argument
to '--srcdir', you can leave out the '--srcdir' option; it is assumed.)

   For example, with version 8.0.1, you can build GDB in a separate
directory for a Sun 4 like this:

     cd gdb-8.0.1
     mkdir ../gdb-sun4
     cd ../gdb-sun4
     ../gdb-8.0.1/configure sun4
     make

   When 'configure' builds a configuration using a remote source
directory, it creates a tree for the binaries with the same structure
(and using the same names) as the tree under the source directory.  In
the example, you'd find the Sun 4 library 'libiberty.a' in the directory
'gdb-sun4/libiberty', and GDB itself in 'gdb-sun4/gdb'.

   Make sure that your path to the 'configure' script has just one
instance of 'gdb' in it.  If your path to 'configure' looks like
'../gdb-8.0.1/gdb/configure', you are configuring only one subdirectory
of GDB, not the whole package.  This leads to build errors about missing
include files such as 'bfd/bfd.h'.

   One popular reason to build several GDB configurations in separate
directories is to configure GDB for cross-compiling (where GDB runs on
one machine--the "host"--while debugging programs that run on another
machine--the "target").  You specify a cross-debugging target by giving
the '--target=TARGET' option to 'configure'.

   When you run 'make' to build a program or library, you must run it in
a configured directory--whatever directory you were in when you called
'configure' (or one of its subdirectories).

   The 'Makefile' that 'configure' generates in each source directory
also runs recursively.  If you type 'make' in a source directory such as
'gdb-8.0.1' (or in a separate configured directory configured with
'--srcdir=DIRNAME/gdb-8.0.1'), you will build all the required
libraries, and then build GDB.

   When you have multiple hosts or targets configured in separate
directories, you can run 'make' on them in parallel (for example, if
they are NFS-mounted on each of the hosts); they will not interfere with
each other.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Config Names,  Next: Configure Options,  Prev: Separate Objdir,  Up: Installing GDB

C.4 Specifying Names for Hosts and Targets
==========================================

The specifications used for hosts and targets in the 'configure' script
are based on a three-part naming scheme, but some short predefined
aliases are also supported.  The full naming scheme encodes three pieces
of information in the following pattern:

     ARCHITECTURE-VENDOR-OS

   For example, you can use the alias 'sun4' as a HOST argument, or as
the value for TARGET in a '--target=TARGET' option.  The equivalent full
name is 'sparc-sun-sunos4'.

   The 'configure' script accompanying GDB does not provide any query
facility to list all supported host and target names or aliases.
'configure' calls the Bourne shell script 'config.sub' to map
abbreviations to full names; you can read the script, if you wish, or
you can use it to test your guesses on abbreviations--for example:

     % sh config.sub i386-linux
     i386-pc-linux-gnu
     % sh config.sub alpha-linux
     alpha-unknown-linux-gnu
     % sh config.sub hp9k700
     hppa1.1-hp-hpux
     % sh config.sub sun4
     sparc-sun-sunos4.1.1
     % sh config.sub sun3
     m68k-sun-sunos4.1.1
     % sh config.sub i986v
     Invalid configuration `i986v': machine `i986v' not recognized

'config.sub' is also distributed in the GDB source directory
('gdb-8.0.1', for version 8.0.1).

C.5 'configure' Options
=======================

Here is a summary of the 'configure' options and arguments that are most
often useful for building GDB.  'configure' also has several other
options not listed here.  *note (configure.info)What Configure Does::,
for a full explanation of 'configure'.

     configure [--help]
               [--prefix=DIR]
               [--exec-prefix=DIR]
               [--srcdir=DIRNAME]
               [--norecursion] [--rm]
               [--target=TARGET]
               HOST

You may introduce options with a single '-' rather than '--' if you
prefer; but you may abbreviate option names if you use '--'.

'--help'
     Display a quick summary of how to invoke 'configure'.

'--prefix=DIR'
     Configure the source to install programs and files under directory
     'DIR'.

'--exec-prefix=DIR'
     Configure the source to install programs under directory 'DIR'.

'--srcdir=DIRNAME'
     *Warning: using this option requires GNU 'make', or another 'make'
     that implements the 'VPATH' feature.*
     Use this option to make configurations in directories separate from
     the GDB source directories.  Among other things, you can use this
     to build (or maintain) several configurations simultaneously, in
     separate directories.  'configure' writes configuration-specific
     files in the current directory, but arranges for them to use the
     source in the directory DIRNAME.  'configure' creates directories
     under the working directory in parallel to the source directories
     below DIRNAME.

'--norecursion'
     Configure only the directory level where 'configure' is executed;
     do not propagate configuration to subdirectories.

'--target=TARGET'
     Configure GDB for cross-debugging programs running on the specified
     TARGET.  Without this option, GDB is configured to debug programs
     that run on the same machine (HOST) as GDB itself.

     There is no convenient way to generate a list of all available
     targets.

'HOST ...'
     Configure GDB to run on the specified HOST.

     There is no convenient way to generate a list of all available
     hosts.

   There are many other options available as well, but they are
generally needed for special purposes only.


File: gdb.info,  Node: System-wide configuration,  Prev: Configure Options,  Up: Installing GDB

C.6 System-wide configuration and settings
==========================================

GDB can be configured to have a system-wide init file; this file will be
read and executed at startup (*note What GDB does during startup:
Startup.).

   Here is the corresponding configure option:

'--with-system-gdbinit=FILE'
     Specify that the default location of the system-wide init file is
     FILE.

   If GDB has been configured with the option '--prefix=$prefix', it may
be subject to relocation.  Two possible cases:

   * If the default location of this init file contains '$prefix', it
     will be subject to relocation.  Suppose that the configure options
     are '--prefix=$prefix --with-system-gdbinit=$prefix/etc/gdbinit';
     if GDB is moved from '$prefix' to '$install', the system init file
     is looked for as '$install/etc/gdbinit' instead of
     '$prefix/etc/gdbinit'.

   * By contrast, if the default location does not contain the prefix,
     it will not be relocated.  E.g. if GDB has been configured with
     '--prefix=/usr/local --with-system-gdbinit=/usr/share/gdb/gdbinit',
     then GDB will always look for '/usr/share/gdb/gdbinit', wherever
     GDB is installed.

   If the configured location of the system-wide init file (as given by
the '--with-system-gdbinit' option at configure time) is in the
data-directory (as specified by '--with-gdb-datadir' at configure time)
or in one of its subdirectories, then GDB will look for the system-wide
init file in the directory specified by the '--data-directory'
command-line option.  Note that the system-wide init file is only read
once, during GDB initialization.  If the data-directory is changed after
GDB has started with the 'set data-directory' command, the file will not
be reread.

File: gdb.info,  Node: System-wide Configuration Scripts,  Up: System-wide configuration

C.6.1 Installed System-wide Configuration Scripts
-------------------------------------------------

The 'system-gdbinit' directory, located inside the data-directory (as
specified by '--with-gdb-datadir' at configure time) contains a number
of scripts which can be used as system-wide init files.  To
automatically source those scripts at startup, GDB should be configured
with '--with-system-gdbinit'.  Otherwise, any user should be able to
source them by hand as needed.

   The following scripts are currently available:

   * 'elinos.py' This script is useful when debugging a program on an
     ELinOS target.  It takes advantage of the environment variables
     defined in a standard ELinOS environment in order to determine the
     location of the system shared libraries, and then sets the
     'solib-absolute-prefix' and 'solib-search-path' variables
     appropriately.

   * 'wrs-linux.py' This script is useful when debugging a program on a
     target running Wind River Linux.  It expects the 'ENV_PREFIX' to be
     set to the host-side sysroot used by the target system.

Appendix D Maintenance Commands
*******************************

In addition to commands intended for GDB users, GDB includes a number of
commands intended for GDB developers, that are not documented elsewhere
in this manual.  These commands are provided here for reference.  (For
commands that turn on debugging messages, see *note Debugging Output::.)

'maint agent [-at LOCATION,] EXPRESSION'
'maint agent-eval [-at LOCATION,] EXPRESSION'
     Translate the given EXPRESSION into remote agent bytecodes.  This
     command is useful for debugging the Agent Expression mechanism
     (*note Agent Expressions::).  The 'agent' version produces an
     expression useful for data collection, such as by tracepoints,
     while 'maint agent-eval' produces an expression that evaluates
     directly to a result.  For instance, a collection expression for
     'globa + globb' will include bytecodes to record four bytes of
     memory at each of the addresses of 'globa' and 'globb', while
     discarding the result of the addition, while an evaluation
     expression will do the addition and return the sum.  If '-at' is
     given, generate remote agent bytecode for LOCATION.  If not,
     generate remote agent bytecode for current frame PC address.

'maint agent-printf FORMAT,EXPR,...'
     Translate the given format string and list of argument expressions
     into remote agent bytecodes and display them as a disassembled
     list.  This command is useful for debugging the agent version of
     dynamic printf (*note Dynamic Printf::).

'maint info breakpoints'
     Using the same format as 'info breakpoints', display both the
     breakpoints you've set explicitly, and those GDB is using for
     internal purposes.  Internal breakpoints are shown with negative
     breakpoint numbers.  The type column identifies what kind of
     breakpoint is shown:

     'breakpoint'
          Normal, explicitly set breakpoint.

     'watchpoint'
          Normal, explicitly set watchpoint.

     'longjmp'
          Internal breakpoint, used to handle correctly stepping through
          'longjmp' calls.

     'longjmp resume'
          Internal breakpoint at the target of a 'longjmp'.

     'until'
          Temporary internal breakpoint used by the GDB 'until' command.

     'finish'
          Temporary internal breakpoint used by the GDB 'finish'
          command.

     'shlib events'
          Shared library events.

'maint info btrace'
     Pint information about raw branch tracing data.

'maint btrace packet-history'
     Print the raw branch trace packets that are used to compute the
     execution history for the 'record btrace' command.  Both the
     information and the format in which it is printed depend on the
     btrace recording format.

     'bts'
          For the BTS recording format, print a list of blocks of
          sequential code.  For each block, the following information is
          printed:

          Block number
               Newer blocks have higher numbers.  The oldest block has
               number zero.
          Lowest 'PC'
          Highest 'PC'

     'pt'
          For the Intel Processor Trace recording format, print a list
          of Intel Processor Trace packets.  For each packet, the
          following information is printed:

          Packet number
               Newer packets have higher numbers.  The oldest packet has
               number zero.
          Trace offset
               The packet's offset in the trace stream.
          Packet opcode and payload

'maint btrace clear-packet-history'
     Discards the cached packet history printed by the 'maint btrace
     packet-history' command.  The history will be computed again when
     needed.

'maint btrace clear'
     Discard the branch trace data.  The data will be fetched anew and
     the branch trace will be recomputed when needed.

     This implicitly truncates the branch trace to a single branch trace
     buffer.  When updating branch trace incrementally, the branch trace
     available to GDB may be bigger than a single branch trace buffer.

'maint set btrace pt skip-pad'
'maint show btrace pt skip-pad'
     Control whether GDB will skip PAD packets when computing the packet
     history.

'set displaced-stepping'
'show displaced-stepping'
     Control whether or not GDB will do "displaced stepping" if the
     target supports it.  Displaced stepping is a way to single-step
     over breakpoints without removing them from the inferior, by
     executing an out-of-line copy of the instruction that was
     originally at the breakpoint location.  It is also known as
     out-of-line single-stepping.

     'set displaced-stepping on'
          If the target architecture supports it, GDB will use displaced
          stepping to step over breakpoints.

     'set displaced-stepping off'
          GDB will not use displaced stepping to step over breakpoints,
          even if such is supported by the target architecture.

     'set displaced-stepping auto'
          This is the default mode.  GDB will use displaced stepping
          only if non-stop mode is active (*note Non-Stop Mode::) and
          the target architecture supports displaced stepping.

'maint check-psymtabs'
     Check the consistency of currently expanded psymtabs versus
     symtabs.  Use this to check, for example, whether a symbol is in
     one but not the other.

'maint check-symtabs'
     Check the consistency of currently expanded symtabs.

'maint expand-symtabs [REGEXP]'
     Expand symbol tables.  If REGEXP is specified, only expand symbol
     tables for file names matching REGEXP.

'maint set catch-demangler-crashes [on|off]'
'maint show catch-demangler-crashes'
     Control whether GDB should attempt to catch crashes in the symbol
     name demangler.  The default is to attempt to catch crashes.  If
     enabled, the first time a crash is caught, a core file is created,
     the offending symbol is displayed and the user is presented with
     the option to terminate the current session.

'maint cplus first_component NAME'
     Print the first C++ class/namespace component of NAME.

'maint cplus namespace'
     Print the list of possible C++ namespaces.

'maint deprecate COMMAND [REPLACEMENT]'
'maint undeprecate COMMAND'
     Deprecate or undeprecate the named COMMAND.  Deprecated commands
     cause GDB to issue a warning when you use them.  The optional
     argument REPLACEMENT says which newer command should be used in
     favor of the deprecated one; if it is given, GDB will mention the
     replacement as part of the warning.

'maint dump-me'
     Cause a fatal signal in the debugger and force it to dump its core.
     This is supported only on systems which support aborting a program
     with the 'SIGQUIT' signal.

'maint internal-error [MESSAGE-TEXT]'
'maint internal-warning [MESSAGE-TEXT]'
'maint demangler-warning [MESSAGE-TEXT]'

     Cause GDB to call the internal function 'internal_error',
     'internal_warning' or 'demangler_warning' and hence behave as
     though an internal problem has been detected.  In addition to
     reporting the internal problem, these functions give the user the
     opportunity to either quit GDB or (for 'internal_error' and
     'internal_warning') create a core file of the current GDB session.

     These commands take an optional parameter MESSAGE-TEXT that is used
     as the text of the error or warning message.

     Here's an example of using 'internal-error':

          (gdb) maint internal-error testing, 1, 2
          .../maint.c:121: internal-error: testing, 1, 2
          A problem internal to GDB has been detected.  Further
          debugging may prove unreliable.
          Quit this debugging session? (y or n) n
          Create a core file? (y or n) n
          (gdb)

'maint set internal-error ACTION [ask|yes|no]'
'maint show internal-error ACTION'
'maint set internal-warning ACTION [ask|yes|no]'
'maint show internal-warning ACTION'
'maint set demangler-warning ACTION [ask|yes|no]'
'maint show demangler-warning ACTION'
     When GDB reports an internal problem (error or warning) it gives
     the user the opportunity to both quit GDB and create a core file of
     the current GDB session.  These commands let you override the
     default behaviour for each particular ACTION, described in the
     table below.

     'quit'
          You can specify that GDB should always (yes) or never (no)
          quit.  The default is to ask the user what to do.

     'corefile'
          You can specify that GDB should always (yes) or never (no)
          create a core file.  The default is to ask the user what to
          do.  Note that there is no 'corefile' option for
          'demangler-warning': demangler warnings always create a core
          file and this cannot be disabled.

'maint packet TEXT'
     If GDB is talking to an inferior via the serial protocol, then this
     command sends the string TEXT to the inferior, and displays the
     response packet.  GDB supplies the initial '$' character, the
     terminating '#' character, and the checksum.

'maint print architecture [FILE]'
     Print the entire architecture configuration.  The optional argument
     FILE names the file where the output goes.

'maint print c-tdesc'
     Print the current target description (*note Target Descriptions::)
     as a C source file.  The created source file can be used in GDB
     when an XML parser is not available to parse the description.

'maint print dummy-frames'
     Prints the contents of GDB's internal dummy-frame stack.

          (gdb) b add
          ...
          (gdb) print add(2,3)
          Breakpoint 2, add (a=2, b=3) at ...
          58	  return (a + b);
          The program being debugged stopped while in a function called from GDB.
          ...
          (gdb) maint print dummy-frames
          0xa8206d8: id={stack=0xbfffe734,code=0xbfffe73f,!special}, ptid=process 9353
          (gdb)

     Takes an optional file parameter.

'maint print registers [FILE]'
'maint print raw-registers [FILE]'
'maint print cooked-registers [FILE]'
'maint print register-groups [FILE]'
'maint print remote-registers [FILE]'
     Print GDB's internal register data structures.

     The command 'maint print raw-registers' includes the contents of
     the raw register cache; the command 'maint print cooked-registers'
     includes the (cooked) value of all registers, including registers
     which aren't available on the target nor visible to user; the
     command 'maint print register-groups' includes the groups that each
     register is a member of; and the command 'maint print
     remote-registers' includes the remote target's register numbers and
     offsets in the 'G' packets.

     These commands take an optional parameter, a file name to which to
     write the information.

'maint print reggroups [FILE]'
     Print GDB's internal register group data structures.  The optional
     argument FILE tells to what file to write the information.

     The register groups info looks like this:

          (gdb) maint print reggroups
           Group      Type
           general    user
           float      user
           all        user
           vector     user
           system     user
           save       internal
           restore    internal

'flushregs'
     This command forces GDB to flush its internal register cache.

'maint print objfiles [REGEXP]'
     Print a dump of all known object files.  If REGEXP is specified,
     only print object files whose names match REGEXP.  For each object
     file, this command prints its name, address in memory, and all of
     its psymtabs and symtabs.

'maint print user-registers'
     List all currently available "user registers".  User registers
     typically provide alternate names for actual hardware registers.
     They include the four "standard" registers '$fp', '$pc', '$sp', and
     '$ps'.  *Note standard registers::.  User registers can be used in
     expressions in the same way as the canonical register names, but
     only the latter are listed by the 'info registers' and 'maint print
     registers' commands.

'maint print section-scripts [REGEXP]'
     Print a dump of scripts specified in the '.debug_gdb_section'
     section.  If REGEXP is specified, only print scripts loaded by
     object files matching REGEXP.  For each script, this command prints
     its name as specified in the objfile, and the full path if known.
     *Note dotdebug_gdb_scripts section::.

'maint print statistics'
     This command prints, for each object file in the program, various
     data about that object file followed by the byte cache ("bcache")
     statistics for the object file.  The objfile data includes the
     number of minimal, partial, full, and stabs symbols, the number of
     types defined by the objfile, the number of as yet unexpanded psym
     tables, the number of line tables and string tables, and the amount
     of memory used by the various tables.  The bcache statistics
     include the counts, sizes, and counts of duplicates of all and
     unique objects, max, average, and median entry size, total memory
     used and its overhead and savings, and various measures of the hash
     table size and chain lengths.

'maint print target-stack'
     A "target" is an interface between the debugger and a particular
     kind of file or process.  Targets can be stacked in "strata", so
     that more than one target can potentially respond to a request.  In
     particular, memory accesses will walk down the stack of targets
     until they find a target that is interested in handling that
     particular address.

     This command prints a short description of each layer that was
     pushed on the "target stack", starting from the top layer down to
     the bottom one.

'maint print type EXPR'
     Print the type chain for a type specified by EXPR.  The argument
     can be either a type name or a symbol.  If it is a symbol, the type
     of that symbol is described.  The type chain produced by this
     command is a recursive definition of the data type as stored in
     GDB's data structures, including its flags and contained types.

     Run any self tests that were compiled in to GDB.  This will print a
     message showing how many tests were run, and how many failed.

'maint set dwarf always-disassemble'
'maint show dwarf always-disassemble'
     Control the behavior of 'info address' when using DWARF debugging
     information.

     The default is 'off', which means that GDB should try to describe a
     variable's location in an easily readable format.  When 'on', GDB
     will instead display the DWARF location expression in an
     assembly-like format.  Note that some locations are too complex for
     GDB to describe simply; in this case you will always see the
     disassembly form.

     Here is an example of the resulting disassembly:

          (gdb) info addr argc
          Symbol "argc" is a complex DWARF expression:
               1: DW_OP_fbreg 0

     For more information on these expressions, see the DWARF standard
     (http://www.dwarfstd.org/).

'maint set dwarf max-cache-age'
'maint show dwarf max-cache-age'
     Control the DWARF compilation unit cache.

     In object files with inter-compilation-unit references, such as
     those produced by the GCC option '-feliminate-dwarf2-dups', the
     DWARF reader needs to frequently refer to previously read
     compilation units.  This setting controls how long a compilation
     unit will remain in the cache if it is not referenced.  A higher
     limit means that cached compilation units will be stored in memory
     longer, and more total memory will be used.  Setting it to zero
     disables caching, which will slow down GDB startup, but reduce
     memory consumption.

'maint set profile'
'maint show profile'
     Control profiling of GDB.

     Profiling will be disabled until you use the 'maint set profile'
     command to enable it.  When you enable profiling, the system will
     begin collecting timing and execution count data; when you disable
     profiling or exit GDB, the results will be written to a log file.
     Remember that if you use profiling, GDB will overwrite the
     profiling log file (often called 'gmon.out').  If you have a record
     of important profiling data in a 'gmon.out' file, be sure to move
     it to a safe location.

     Configuring with '--enable-profiling' arranges for GDB to be
     compiled with the '-pg' compiler option.

'maint set show-debug-regs'
'maint show show-debug-regs'
     Control whether to show variables that mirror the hardware debug
     registers.  Use 'on' to enable, 'off' to disable.  If enabled, the
     debug registers values are shown when GDB inserts or removes a
     hardware breakpoint or watchpoint, and when the inferior triggers a
     hardware-assisted breakpoint or watchpoint.

'maint set show-all-tib'
'maint show show-all-tib'
     Control whether to show all non zero areas within a 1k block
     starting at thread local base, when using the 'info w32
     thread-information-block' command.

'maint set target-async'
'maint show target-async'
     This controls whether GDB targets operate in synchronous or
     asynchronous mode (*note Background Execution::).  Normally the
     default is asynchronous, if it is available; but this can be
     changed to more easily debug problems occurring only in synchronous
     mode.

'maint set target-non-stop'
'maint show target-non-stop'

     This controls whether GDB targets always operate in non-stop mode
     even if 'set non-stop' is 'off' (*note Non-Stop Mode::).  The
     default is 'auto', meaning non-stop mode is enabled if supported by
     the target.

     'maint set target-non-stop auto'
          This is the default mode.  GDB controls the target in non-stop
          mode if the target supports it.

     'maint set target-non-stop on'
          GDB controls the target in non-stop mode even if the target
          does not indicate support.

     'maint set target-non-stop off'
          GDB does not control the target in non-stop mode even if the
          target supports it.

'maint set per-command'
'maint show per-command'

     GDB can display the resources used by each command.  This is useful
     in debugging performance problems.

     'maint set per-command space [on|off]'
     'maint show per-command space'
          Enable or disable the printing of the memory used by GDB for
          each command.  If enabled, GDB will display how much memory
          each command took, following the command's own output.  This
          can also be requested by invoking GDB with the '--statistics'
          command-line switch (*note Mode Options::).

     'maint set per-command time [on|off]'
     'maint show per-command time'
          Enable or disable the printing of the execution time of GDB
          for each command.  If enabled, GDB will display how much time
          it took to execute each command, following the command's own
          output.  Both CPU time and wallclock time are printed.
          Printing both is useful when trying to determine whether the
          cost is CPU or, e.g., disk/network latency.  Note that the CPU
          time printed is for GDB only, it does not include the
          execution time of the inferior because there's no mechanism
          currently to compute how much time was spent by GDB and how
          much time was spent by the program been debugged.  This can
          also be requested by invoking GDB with the '--statistics'
          command-line switch (*note Mode Options::).

     'maint set per-command symtab [on|off]'
     'maint show per-command symtab'
          Enable or disable the printing of basic symbol table
          statistics for each command.  If enabled, GDB will display the
          following information:

            a. number of symbol tables
            b. number of primary symbol tables
            c. number of blocks in the blockvector

'maint space VALUE'
     An alias for 'maint set per-command space'.  A non-zero value
     enables it, zero disables it.

'maint time VALUE'
     An alias for 'maint set per-command time'.  A non-zero value
     enables it, zero disables it.

'maint translate-address [SECTION] ADDR'
     Find the symbol stored at the location specified by the address
     ADDR and an optional section name SECTION.  If found, GDB prints
     the name of the closest symbol and an offset from the symbol's
     location to the specified address.  This is similar to the 'info
     address' command (*note Symbols::), except that this command also
     allows to find symbols in other sections.

     If section was not specified, the section in which the symbol was
     found is also printed.  For dynamically linked executables, the
     name of executable or shared library containing the symbol is
     printed as well.

   The following command is useful for non-interactive invocations of
GDB, such as in the test suite.

'set watchdog NSEC'
     Set the maximum number of seconds GDB will wait for the target
     operation to finish.  If this time expires, GDB reports and error
     and the command is aborted.

'show watchdog'
     Show the current setting of the target wait timeout.

File: gdb.info,  Node: Overview,  Next: Packets,  Up: Remote Protocol

E.1 Overview
============

There may be occasions when you need to know something about the
protocol--for example, if there is only one serial port to your target
machine, you might want your program to do something special if it
recognizes a packet meant for GDB.

   In the examples below, '->' and '<-' are used to indicate transmitted
and received data, respectively.

   All GDB commands and responses (other than acknowledgments and
notifications, see *note Notification Packets::) are sent as a PACKET.
A PACKET is introduced with the character '$', the actual PACKET-DATA,
and the terminating character '#' followed by a two-digit CHECKSUM:

     $PACKET-DATA#CHECKSUM

The two-digit CHECKSUM is computed as the modulo 256 sum of all
characters between the leading '$' and the trailing '#' (an eight bit
unsigned checksum).

   Implementors should note that prior to GDB 5.0 the protocol
specification also included an optional two-digit SEQUENCE-ID:

     $SEQUENCE-ID:PACKET-DATA#CHECKSUM

That SEQUENCE-ID was appended to the acknowledgment.  GDB has never
output SEQUENCE-IDs.  Stubs that handle packets added since GDB 5.0 must
not accept SEQUENCE-ID.

   When either the host or the target machine receives a packet, the
first response expected is an acknowledgment: either '+' (to indicate
the package was received correctly) or '-' (to request retransmission):

     -> $PACKET-DATA#CHECKSUM
     <- +

   The '+'/'-' acknowledgments can be disabled once a connection is
established.  *Note Packet Acknowledgment::, for details.

   The host (GDB) sends COMMANDs, and the target (the debugging stub
incorporated in your program) sends a RESPONSE.  In the case of step and
continue COMMANDs, the response is only sent when the operation has
completed, and the target has again stopped all threads in all attached
processes.  This is the default all-stop mode behavior, but the remote
protocol also supports GDB's non-stop execution mode; see *note Remote
Non-Stop::, for details.

   PACKET-DATA consists of a sequence of characters with the exception
of '#' and '$' (see 'X' packet for additional exceptions).

   Fields within the packet should be separated using ',' ';' or ':'.
Except where otherwise noted all numbers are represented in HEX with
leading zeros suppressed.

   Implementors should note that prior to GDB 5.0, the character ':'
could not appear as the third character in a packet (as it would
potentially conflict with the SEQUENCE-ID).

   Binary data in most packets is encoded either as two hexadecimal
digits per byte of binary data.  This allowed the traditional remote
protocol to work over connections which were only seven-bit clean.  Some
packets designed more recently assume an eight-bit clean connection, and
use a more efficient encoding to send and receive binary data.

   The binary data representation uses '7d' (ASCII '}') as an escape
character.  Any escaped byte is transmitted as the escape character
followed by the original character XORed with '0x20'.  For example, the
byte '0x7d' would be transmitted as the two bytes '0x7d 0x5d'.  The
bytes '0x23' (ASCII '#'), '0x24' (ASCII '$'), and '0x7d' (ASCII '}')
must always be escaped.  Responses sent by the stub must also escape
'0x2a' (ASCII '*'), so that it is not interpreted as the start of a
run-length encoded sequence (described next).

   Response DATA can be run-length encoded to save space.  Run-length
encoding replaces runs of identical characters with one instance of the
repeated character, followed by a '*' and a repeat count.  The repeat
count is itself sent encoded, to avoid binary characters in DATA: a
value of N is sent as 'N+29'.  For a repeat count greater or equal to 3,
this produces a printable ASCII character, e.g. a space (ASCII code 32)
for a repeat count of 3.  (This is because run-length encoding starts to
win for counts 3 or more.)  Thus, for example, '0* ' is a run-length
encoding of "0000": the space character after '*' means repeat the
leading '0' '32 - 29 = 3' more times.

   The printable characters '#' and '$' or with a numeric value greater
than 126 must not be used.  Runs of six repeats ('#') or seven repeats
('$') can be expanded using a repeat count of only five ('"').  For
example, '00000000' can be encoded as '0*"00'.

   The error response returned for some packets includes a two character
error number.  That number is not well defined.

   For any COMMAND not supported by the stub, an empty response ('$#00')
should be returned.  That way it is possible to extend the protocol.  A
newer GDB can tell if a packet is supported based on that response.

   At a minimum, a stub is required to support the 'g' and 'G' commands
for register access, and the 'm' and 'M' commands for memory access.
Stubs that only control single-threaded targets can implement run
control with the 'c' (continue), and 's' (step) commands.  Stubs that
support multi-threading targets should support the 'vCont' command.  All
other commands are optional.

E.2 Packets
===========

The following table provides a complete list of all currently defined
COMMANDs and their corresponding response DATA.  *Note File-I/O Remote
Protocol Extension::, for details about the File I/O extension of the
remote protocol.

   Each packet's description has a template showing the packet's overall
syntax, followed by an explanation of the packet's meaning.  We include
spaces in some of the templates for clarity; these are not part of the
packet's syntax.  No GDB packet uses spaces to separate its components.
For example, a template like 'foo BAR BAZ' describes a packet beginning
with the three ASCII bytes 'foo', followed by a BAR, followed directly
by a BAZ.  GDB does not transmit a space character between the 'foo' and
the BAR, or between the BAR and the BAZ.

   Several packets and replies include a THREAD-ID field to identify a
thread.  Normally these are positive numbers with a target-specific
interpretation, formatted as big-endian hex strings.  A THREAD-ID can
also be a literal '-1' to indicate all threads, or '0' to pick any
thread.

   In addition, the remote protocol supports a multiprocess feature in
which the THREAD-ID syntax is extended to optionally include both
process and thread ID fields, as 'pPID.TID'.  The PID (process) and TID
(thread) components each have the format described above: a positive
number with target-specific interpretation formatted as a big-endian hex
string, literal '-1' to indicate all processes or threads
(respectively), or '0' to indicate an arbitrary process or thread.
Specifying just a process, as 'pPID', is equivalent to 'pPID.-1'.  It is
an error to specify all processes but a specific thread, such as
'p-1.TID'.  Note that the 'p' prefix is _not_ used for those packets and
replies explicitly documented to include a process ID, rather than a
THREAD-ID.

   The multiprocess THREAD-ID syntax extensions are only used if both
GDB and the stub report support for the 'multiprocess' feature using
'qSupported'.  *Note multiprocess extensions::, for more information.

   Note that all packet forms beginning with an upper- or lower-case
letter, other than those described here, are reserved for future use.

   Here are the packet descriptions.

'!'
     Enable extended mode.  In extended mode, the remote server is made
     persistent.  The 'R' packet is used to restart the program being
     debugged.

     Reply:
     'OK'
          The remote target both supports and has enabled extended mode.

'?'
     Indicate the reason the target halted.  The reply is the same as
     for step and continue.  This packet has a special interpretation
     when the target is in non-stop mode; see *note Remote Non-Stop::.

     Reply: *Note Stop Reply Packets::, for the reply specifications.

'A ARGLEN,ARGNUM,ARG,...'
     Initialized 'argv[]' array passed into program.  ARGLEN specifies
     the number of bytes in the hex encoded byte stream ARG.  See
     'gdbserver' for more details.

     Reply:
     'OK'
          The arguments were set.
     'E NN'
          An error occurred.

'b BAUD'
     (Don't use this packet; its behavior is not well-defined.)  Change
     the serial line speed to BAUD.

     JTC: _When does the transport layer state change?  When it's
     received, or after the ACK is transmitted.  In either case, there
     are problems if the command or the acknowledgment packet is
     dropped._

     Stan: _If people really wanted to add something like this, and get
     it working for the first time, they ought to modify ser-unix.c to
     send some kind of out-of-band message to a specially-setup stub and
     have the switch happen "in between" packets, so that from remote
     protocol's point of view, nothing actually happened._

'B ADDR,MODE'
     Set (MODE is 'S') or clear (MODE is 'C') a breakpoint at ADDR.

     Don't use this packet.  Use the 'Z' and 'z' packets instead (*note
     insert breakpoint or watchpoint packet::).

'bc'
     Backward continue.  Execute the target system in reverse.  No
     parameter.  *Note Reverse Execution::, for more information.

     Reply: *Note Stop Reply Packets::, for the reply specifications.

'bs'
     Backward single step.  Execute one instruction in reverse.  No
     parameter.  *Note Reverse Execution::, for more information.

     Reply: *Note Stop Reply Packets::, for the reply specifications.

'c [ADDR]'
     Continue at ADDR, which is the address to resume.  If ADDR is
     omitted, resume at current address.

     This packet is deprecated for multi-threading support.  *Note vCont
     packet::.

     Reply: *Note Stop Reply Packets::, for the reply specifications.

'C SIG[;ADDR]'
     Continue with signal SIG (hex signal number).  If ';ADDR' is
     omitted, resume at same address.

     This packet is deprecated for multi-threading support.  *Note vCont
     packet::.

     Reply: *Note Stop Reply Packets::, for the reply specifications.

'd'
     Toggle debug flag.

     Don't use this packet; instead, define a general set packet (*note
     General Query Packets::).

'D'
'D;PID'
     The first form of the packet is used to detach GDB from the remote
     system.  It is sent to the remote target before GDB disconnects via
     the 'detach' command.

     The second form, including a process ID, is used when multiprocess
     protocol extensions are enabled (*note multiprocess extensions::),
     to detach only a specific process.  The PID is specified as a
     big-endian hex string.

     Reply:
     'OK'
          for success
     'E NN'
          for an error

'F RC,EE,CF;XX'
     A reply from GDB to an 'F' packet sent by the target.  This is part
     of the File-I/O protocol extension.  *Note File-I/O Remote Protocol
     Extension::, for the specification.

'g'
     Read general registers.

     Reply:
     'XX...'
          Each byte of register data is described by two hex digits.
          The bytes with the register are transmitted in target byte
          order.  The size of each register and their position within
          the 'g' packet are determined by the GDB internal gdbarch
          functions 'DEPRECATED_REGISTER_RAW_SIZE' and
          'gdbarch_register_name'.

          When reading registers from a trace frame (*note Using the
          Collected Data: Analyze Collected Data.), the stub may also
          return a string of literal 'x''s in place of the register data
          digits, to indicate that the corresponding register has not
          been collected, thus its value is unavailable.  For example,
          for an architecture with 4 registers of 4 bytes each, the
          following reply indicates to GDB that registers 0 and 2 have
          not been collected, while registers 1 and 3 have been
          collected, and both have zero value:

               -> g
               <- xxxxxxxx00000000xxxxxxxx00000000

     'E NN'
          for an error.

'G XX...'
     Write general registers.  *Note read registers packet::, for a
     description of the XX... data.

     Reply:
     'OK'
          for success
     'E NN'
          for an error

'H OP THREAD-ID'
     Set thread for subsequent operations ('m', 'M', 'g', 'G', et.al.).
     Depending on the operation to be performed, OP should be 'c' for
     step and continue operations (note that this is deprecated,
     supporting the 'vCont' command is a better option), and 'g' for
     other operations.  The thread designator THREAD-ID has the format
     and interpretation described in *note thread-id syntax::.

     Reply:
     'OK'
          for success
     'E NN'
          for an error

'i [ADDR[,NNN]]'
     Step the remote target by a single clock cycle.  If ',NNN' is
     present, cycle step NNN cycles.  If ADDR is present, cycle step
     starting at that address.

'I'
     Signal, then cycle step.  *Note step with signal packet::.  *Note
     cycle step packet::.

'k'
     Kill request.

     The exact effect of this packet is not specified.

     For a bare-metal target, it may power cycle or reset the target
     system.  For that reason, the 'k' packet has no reply.

     For a single-process target, it may kill that process if possible.

     A multiple-process target may choose to kill just one process, or
     all that are under GDB's control.  For more precise control, use
     the vKill packet (*note vKill packet::).

     If the target system immediately closes the connection in response
     to 'k', GDB does not consider the lack of packet acknowledgment to
     be an error, and assumes the kill was successful.

     If connected using 'target extended-remote', and the target does
     not close the connection in response to a kill request, GDB probes
     the target state as if a new connection was opened (*note ?
     packet::).

'm ADDR,LENGTH'
     Read LENGTH addressable memory units starting at address ADDR
     (*note addressable memory unit::).  Note that ADDR may not be
     aligned to any particular boundary.

     The stub need not use any particular size or alignment when
     gathering data from memory for the response; even if ADDR is
     word-aligned and LENGTH is a multiple of the word size, the stub is
     free to use byte accesses, or not.  For this reason, this packet
     may not be suitable for accessing memory-mapped I/O devices.

     Reply:
     'XX...'
          Memory contents; each byte is transmitted as a two-digit
          hexadecimal number.  The reply may contain fewer addressable
          memory units than requested if the server was able to read
          only part of the region of memory.
     'E NN'
          NN is errno

'M ADDR,LENGTH:XX...'
     Write LENGTH addressable memory units starting at address ADDR
     (*note addressable memory unit::).  The data is given by XX...;
     each byte is transmitted as a two-digit hexadecimal number.

     Reply:
     'OK'
          for success
     'E NN'
          for an error (this includes the case where only part of the
          data was written).

'p N'
     Read the value of register N; N is in hex.  *Note read registers
     packet::, for a description of how the returned register value is
     encoded.

     Reply:
     'XX...'
          the register's value
     'E NN'
          for an error
     ''
          Indicating an unrecognized QUERY.

'P N...=R...'
     Write register N... with value R....  The register number N is in
     hexadecimal, and R... contains two hex digits for each byte in the
     register (target byte order).

     Reply:
     'OK'
          for success
     'E NN'
          for an error

'q NAME PARAMS...'
'Q NAME PARAMS...'
     General query ('q') and set ('Q').  These packets are described
     fully in *note General Query Packets::.

'r'
     Reset the entire system.

     Don't use this packet; use the 'R' packet instead.

'R XX'
     Restart the program being debugged.  The XX, while needed, is
     ignored.  This packet is only available in extended mode (*note
     extended mode::).

     The 'R' packet has no reply.

's [ADDR]'
     Single step, resuming at ADDR.  If ADDR is omitted, resume at same
     address.

     This packet is deprecated for multi-threading support.  *Note vCont
     packet::.

     Reply: *Note Stop Reply Packets::, for the reply specifications.

'S SIG[;ADDR]'
     Step with signal.  This is analogous to the 'C' packet, but
     requests a single-step, rather than a normal resumption of
     execution.

     This packet is deprecated for multi-threading support.  *Note vCont
     packet::.

     Reply: *Note Stop Reply Packets::, for the reply specifications.

't ADDR:PP,MM'
     Search backwards starting at address ADDR for a match with pattern
     PP and mask MM, both of which are are 4 byte long.  There must be
     at least 3 digits in ADDR.

'T THREAD-ID'
     Find out if the thread THREAD-ID is alive.  *Note thread-id
     syntax::.

     Reply:
     'OK'
          thread is still alive
     'E NN'
          thread is dead

'v'
     Packets starting with 'v' are identified by a multi-letter name, up
     to the first ';' or '?' (or the end of the packet).

'vAttach;PID'
     Attach to a new process with the specified process ID PID.  The
     process ID is a hexadecimal integer identifying the process.  In
     all-stop mode, all threads in the attached process are stopped; in
     non-stop mode, it may be attached without being stopped if that is
     supported by the target.

     This packet is only available in extended mode (*note extended
     mode::).

     Reply:
     'E NN'
          for an error
     'Any stop packet'
          for success in all-stop mode (*note Stop Reply Packets::)
     'OK'
          for success in non-stop mode (*note Remote Non-Stop::)

'vCont[;ACTION[:THREAD-ID]]...'
     Resume the inferior, specifying different actions for each thread.

     For each inferior thread, the leftmost action with a matching
     THREAD-ID is applied.  Threads that don't match any action remain
     in their current state.  Thread IDs are specified using the syntax
     described in *note thread-id syntax::.  If multiprocess extensions
     (*note multiprocess extensions::) are supported, actions can be
     specified to match all threads in a process by using the 'pPID.-1'
     form of the THREAD-ID.  An action with no THREAD-ID matches all
     threads.  Specifying no actions is an error.

     Currently supported actions are:

     'c'
          Continue.
     'C SIG'
          Continue with signal SIG.  The signal SIG should be two hex
          digits.
     's'
          Step.
     'S SIG'
          Step with signal SIG.  The signal SIG should be two hex
          digits.
     't'
          Stop.
     'r START,END'
          Step once, and then keep stepping as long as the thread stops
          at addresses between START (inclusive) and END (exclusive).
          The remote stub reports a stop reply when either the thread
          goes out of the range or is stopped due to an unrelated
          reason, such as hitting a breakpoint.  *Note range stepping::.

          If the range is empty (START == END), then the action becomes
          equivalent to the 's' action.  In other words, single-step
          once, and report the stop (even if the stepped instruction
          jumps to START).

          (A stop reply may be sent at any point even if the PC is still
          within the stepping range; for example, it is valid to
          implement this packet in a degenerate way as a single
          instruction step operation.)

     The optional argument ADDR normally associated with the 'c', 'C',
     's', and 'S' packets is not supported in 'vCont'.

     The 't' action is only relevant in non-stop mode (*note Remote
     Non-Stop::) and may be ignored by the stub otherwise.  A stop reply
     should be generated for any affected thread not already stopped.
     When a thread is stopped by means of a 't' action, the
     corresponding stop reply should indicate that the thread has
     stopped with signal '0', regardless of whether the target uses some
     other signal as an implementation detail.

     The server must ignore 'c', 'C', 's', 'S', and 'r' actions for
     threads that are already running.  Conversely, the server must
     ignore 't' actions for threads that are already stopped.

     _Note:_ In non-stop mode, a thread is considered running until GDB
     acknowleges an asynchronous stop notification for it with the
     'vStopped' packet (*note Remote Non-Stop::).

     The stub must support 'vCont' if it reports support for
     multiprocess extensions (*note multiprocess extensions::).

     Reply: *Note Stop Reply Packets::, for the reply specifications.

'vCont?'
     Request a list of actions supported by the 'vCont' packet.

     Reply:
     'vCont[;ACTION...]'
          The 'vCont' packet is supported.  Each ACTION is a supported
          command in the 'vCont' packet.
     ''
          The 'vCont' packet is not supported.

'vCtrlC'
     Interrupt remote target as if a control-C was pressed on the remote
     terminal.  This is the equivalent to reacting to the '^C' ('\003',
     the control-C character) character in all-stop mode while the
     target is running, except this works in non-stop mode.  *Note
     interrupting remote targets::, for more info on the all-stop
     variant.

'vFile:OPERATION:PARAMETER...'
     Perform a file operation on the target system.  For details, see
     *note Host I/O Packets::.

'vFlashErase:ADDR,LENGTH'
     Direct the stub to erase LENGTH bytes of flash starting at ADDR.
     The region may enclose any number of flash blocks, but its start
     and end must fall on block boundaries, as indicated by the flash
     block size appearing in the memory map (*note Memory Map Format::).
     GDB groups flash memory programming operations together, and sends
     a 'vFlashDone' request after each group; the stub is allowed to
     delay erase operation until the 'vFlashDone' packet is received.

     Reply:
     'OK'
          for success
     'E NN'
          for an error

'vFlashWrite:ADDR:XX...'
     Direct the stub to write data to flash address ADDR.  The data is
     passed in binary form using the same encoding as for the 'X' packet
     (*note Binary Data::).  The memory ranges specified by
     'vFlashWrite' packets preceding a 'vFlashDone' packet must not
     overlap, and must appear in order of increasing addresses (although
     'vFlashErase' packets for higher addresses may already have been
     received; the ordering is guaranteed only between 'vFlashWrite'
     packets).  If a packet writes to an address that was neither erased
     by a preceding 'vFlashErase' packet nor by some other
     target-specific method, the results are unpredictable.

'vFlashDone'
     Indicate to the stub that flash programming operation is finished.
     The stub is permitted to delay or batch the effects of a group of
     'vFlashErase' and 'vFlashWrite' packets until a 'vFlashDone' packet
     is received.  The contents of the affected regions of flash memory
     are unpredictable until the 'vFlashDone' request is completed.

'vKill;PID'
     Kill the process with the specified process ID PID, which is a
     hexadecimal integer identifying the process.  This packet is used
     in preference to 'k' when multiprocess protocol extensions are
     supported; see *note multiprocess extensions::.

'vRun;FILENAME[;ARGUMENT]...'
     Run the program FILENAME, passing it each ARGUMENT on its command
     line.  The file and arguments are hex-encoded strings.  If FILENAME
     is an empty string, the stub may use a default program (e.g. the
     last program run).  The program is created in the stopped state.

'z TYPE,ADDR,KIND'
'Z TYPE,ADDR,KIND'
     Insert ('Z') or remove ('z') a TYPE breakpoint or watchpoint
     starting at address ADDRESS of kind KIND.

     Each breakpoint and watchpoint packet TYPE is documented
     separately.

     _Implementation notes: A remote target shall return an empty string
     for an unrecognized breakpoint or watchpoint packet TYPE.  A remote
     target shall support either both or neither of a given 'ZTYPE...'
     and 'zTYPE...' packet pair.  To avoid potential problems with
     duplicate packets, the operations should be implemented in an
     idempotent way._

'z0,ADDR,KIND'
'Z0,ADDR,KIND[;COND_LIST...][;cmds:PERSIST,CMD_LIST...]'
     Insert ('Z0') or remove ('z0') a software breakpoint at address
     ADDR of type KIND.

     A software breakpoint is implemented by replacing the instruction
     at ADDR with a software breakpoint or trap instruction.  The KIND
     is target-specific and typically indicates the size of the
     breakpoint in bytes that should be inserted.  E.g., the ARM and
     MIPS can insert either a 2 or 4 byte breakpoint.  Some
     architectures have additional meanings for KIND (*note
     Architecture-Specific Protocol Details::); if no
     architecture-specific value is being used, it should be '0'.  KIND
     is hex-encoded.  COND_LIST is an optional list of conditional
     expressions in bytecode form that should be evaluated on the
     target's side.  These are the conditions that should be taken into
     consideration when deciding if the breakpoint trigger should be
     reported back to GDB.

     See also the 'swbreak' stop reason (*note swbreak stop reason::)
     for how to best report a software breakpoint event to GDB.

     The COND_LIST parameter is comprised of a series of expressions,
     concatenated without separators.  Each expression has the following
     form:

     'X LEN,EXPR'
          LEN is the length of the bytecode expression and EXPR is the
          actual conditional expression in bytecode form.

     The optional CMD_LIST parameter introduces commands that may be run
     on the target, rather than being reported back to GDB.  The
     parameter starts with a numeric flag PERSIST; if the flag is
     nonzero, then the breakpoint may remain active and the commands
     continue to be run even when GDB disconnects from the target.
     Following this flag is a series of expressions concatenated with no
     separators.  Each expression has the following form:

     'X LEN,EXPR'
          LEN is the length of the bytecode expression and EXPR is the
          actual conditional expression in bytecode form.

     _Implementation note: It is possible for a target to copy or move
     code that contains software breakpoints (e.g., when implementing
     overlays).  The behavior of this packet, in the presence of such a
     target, is not defined._

'Z1,ADDR,KIND[;COND_LIST...][;cmds:PERSIST,CMD_LIST...]'
     Insert ('Z1') or remove ('z1') a hardware breakpoint at address
     ADDR.

     A hardware breakpoint is implemented using a mechanism that is not
     dependent on being able to modify the target's memory.  The KIND,
     COND_LIST, and CMD_LIST arguments have the same meaning as in 'Z0'
     packets.

     _Implementation note: A hardware breakpoint is not affected by code
     movement._

E.3 Stop Reply Packets
======================

The 'C', 'c', 'S', 's', 'vCont', 'vAttach', 'vRun', 'vStopped', and '?'
packets can receive any of the below as a reply.  Except for '?' and
'vStopped', that reply is only returned when the target halts.  In the
below the exact meaning of "signal number" is defined by the header
'include/gdb/signals.h' in the GDB source code.

   In non-stop mode, the server will simply reply 'OK' to commands such
as 'vCont'; any stop will be the subject of a future notification.
*Note Remote Non-Stop::.

   As in the description of request packets, we include spaces in the
reply templates for clarity; these are not part of the reply packet's
syntax.  No GDB stop reply packet uses spaces to separate its
components.

'S AA'
     The program received signal number AA (a two-digit hexadecimal
     number).  This is equivalent to a 'T' response with no N:R pairs.

'T AA N1:R1;N2:R2;...'
     The program received signal number AA (a two-digit hexadecimal
     number).  This is equivalent to an 'S' response, except that the
     'N:R' pairs can carry values of important registers and other
     information directly in the stop reply packet, reducing round-trip
     latency.  Single-step and breakpoint traps are reported this way.
     Each 'N:R' pair is interpreted as follows:

        * If N is a hexadecimal number, it is a register number, and the
          corresponding R gives that register's value.  The data R is a
          series of bytes in target byte order, with each byte given by
          a two-digit hex number.

        * If N is 'thread', then R is the THREAD-ID of the stopped
          thread, as specified in *note thread-id syntax::.

        * If N is 'core', then R is the hexadecimal number of the core
          on which the stop event was detected.

        * If N is a recognized "stop reason", it describes a more
          specific event that stopped the target.  The currently defined
          stop reasons are listed below.  The AA should be '05', the
          trap signal.  At most one stop reason should be present.

        * Otherwise, GDB should ignore this 'N:R' pair and go on to the
          next; this allows us to extend the protocol in the future.

     The currently defined stop reasons are:

     'watch'
     'rwatch'
     'awatch'
          The packet indicates a watchpoint hit, and R is the data
          address, in hex.

     'syscall_entry'
     'syscall_return'
          The packet indicates a syscall entry or return, and R is the
          syscall number, in hex.

     'library'
          The packet indicates that the loaded libraries have changed.
          GDB should use 'qXfer:libraries:read' to fetch a new list of
          loaded libraries.  The R part is ignored.

     'replaylog'
          The packet indicates that the target cannot continue replaying
          logged execution events, because it has reached the end (or
          the beginning when executing backward) of the log.  The value
          of R will be either 'begin' or 'end'.  *Note Reverse
          Execution::, for more information.

     'swbreak'
          The packet indicates a software breakpoint instruction was
          executed, irrespective of whether it was GDB that planted the
          breakpoint or the breakpoint is hardcoded in the program.  The
          R part must be left empty.

          On some architectures, such as x86, at the architecture level,
          when a breakpoint instruction executes the program counter
          points at the breakpoint address plus an offset.  On such
          targets, the stub is responsible for adjusting the PC to point
          back at the breakpoint address.

          This packet should not be sent by default; older GDB versions
          did not support it.  GDB requests it, by supplying an
          appropriate 'qSupported' feature (*note qSupported::).  The
          remote stub must also supply the appropriate 'qSupported'
          feature indicating support.

          This packet is required for correct non-stop mode operation.

     'hwbreak'
          The packet indicates the target stopped for a hardware
          breakpoint.  The R part must be left empty.

          The same remarks about 'qSupported' and non-stop mode above
          apply.

     'fork'
          The packet indicates that 'fork' was called, and R is the
          thread ID of the new child process.  Refer to *note thread-id
          syntax:: for the format of the THREAD-ID field.  This packet
          is only applicable to targets that support fork events.

          This packet should not be sent by default; older GDB versions
          did not support it.  GDB requests it, by supplying an
          appropriate 'qSupported' feature (*note qSupported::).  The
          remote stub must also supply the appropriate 'qSupported'
          feature indicating support.

     'vfork'
          The packet indicates that 'vfork' was called, and R is the
          thread ID of the new child process.  Refer to *note thread-id
          syntax:: for the format of the THREAD-ID field.  This packet
          is only applicable to targets that support vfork events.

          This packet should not be sent by default; older GDB versions
          did not support it.  GDB requests it, by supplying an
          appropriate 'qSupported' feature (*note qSupported::).  The
          remote stub must also supply the appropriate 'qSupported'
          feature indicating support.

     'vforkdone'
          The packet indicates that a child process created by a vfork
          has either called 'exec' or terminated, so that the address
          spaces of the parent and child process are no longer shared.
          The R part is ignored.  This packet is only applicable to
          targets that support vforkdone events.

          This packet should not be sent by default; older GDB versions
          did not support it.  GDB requests it, by supplying an
          appropriate 'qSupported' feature (*note qSupported::).  The
          remote stub must also supply the appropriate 'qSupported'
          feature indicating support.

     'exec'
          The packet indicates that 'execve' was called, and R is the
          absolute pathname of the file that was executed, in hex.  This
          packet is only applicable to targets that support exec events.

          This packet should not be sent by default; older GDB versions
          did not support it.  GDB requests it, by supplying an
          appropriate 'qSupported' feature (*note qSupported::).  The
          remote stub must also supply the appropriate 'qSupported'
          feature indicating support.

     'create'
          The packet indicates that the thread was just created.  The
          new thread is stopped until GDB sets it running with a
          resumption packet (*note vCont packet::).  This packet should
          not be sent by default; GDB requests it with the *note
          QThreadEvents:: packet.  See also the 'w' (*note thread exit
          event::) remote reply below.  The R part is ignored.

'W AA'
'W AA ; process:PID'
     The process exited, and AA is the exit status.  This is only
     applicable to certain targets.

     The second form of the response, including the process ID of the
     exited process, can be used only when GDB has reported support for
     multiprocess protocol extensions; see *note multiprocess
     extensions::.  Both AA and PID are formatted as big-endian hex
     strings.

'X AA'
'X AA ; process:PID'
     The process terminated with signal AA.

     The second form of the response, including the process ID of the
     terminated process, can be used only when GDB has reported support
     for multiprocess protocol extensions; see *note multiprocess
     extensions::.  Both AA and PID are formatted as big-endian hex
     strings.

'w AA ; TID'

     The thread exited, and AA is the exit status.  This response should
     not be sent by default; GDB requests it with the *note
     QThreadEvents:: packet.  See also *note thread create event::
     above.  AA is formatted as a big-endian hex string.

'N'
     There are no resumed threads left in the target.  In other words,
     even though the process is alive, the last resumed thread has
     exited.  For example, say the target process has two threads:
     thread 1 and thread 2.  The client leaves thread 1 stopped, and
     resumes thread 2, which subsequently exits.  At this point, even
     though the process is still alive, and thus no 'W' stop reply is
     sent, no thread is actually executing either.  The 'N' stop reply
     thus informs the client that it can stop waiting for stop replies.
     This packet should not be sent by default; older GDB versions did
     not support it.  GDB requests it, by supplying an appropriate
     'qSupported' feature (*note qSupported::).  The remote stub must
     also supply the appropriate 'qSupported' feature indicating
     support.

'O XX...'
     'XX...' is hex encoding of ASCII data, to be written as the
     program's console output.  This can happen at any time while the
     program is running and the debugger should continue to wait for
     'W', 'T', etc.  This reply is not permitted in non-stop mode.

'F CALL-ID,PARAMETER...'
     CALL-ID is the identifier which says which host system call should
     be called.  This is just the name of the function.  Translation
     into the correct system call is only applicable as it's defined in
     GDB.  *Note File-I/O Remote Protocol Extension::, for a list of
     implemented system calls.

     'PARAMETER...' is a list of parameters as defined for this very
     system call.

     The target replies with this packet when it expects GDB to call a
     host system call on behalf of the target.  GDB replies with an
     appropriate 'F' packet and keeps up waiting for the next reply
     packet from the target.  The latest 'C', 'c', 'S' or 's' action is
     expected to be continued.  *Note File-I/O Remote Protocol
     Extension::, for more details.

E.4 General Query Packets
=========================

Packets starting with 'q' are "general query packets"; packets starting
with 'Q' are "general set packets".  General query and set packets are a
semi-unified form for retrieving and sending information to and from the
stub.

   The initial letter of a query or set packet is followed by a name
indicating what sort of thing the packet applies to.  For example, GDB
may use a 'qSymbol' packet to exchange symbol definitions with the stub.
These packet names follow some conventions:

   * The name must not contain commas, colons or semicolons.
   * Most GDB query and set packets have a leading upper case letter.
   * The names of custom vendor packets should use a company prefix, in
     lower case, followed by a period.  For example, packets designed at
     the Acme Corporation might begin with 'qacme.foo' (for querying
     foos) or 'Qacme.bar' (for setting bars).

   The name of a query or set packet should be separated from any
parameters by a ':'; the parameters themselves should be separated by
',' or ';'.  Stubs must be careful to match the full packet name, and
check for a separator or the end of the packet, in case two packet names
share a common prefix.  New packets should not begin with 'qC', 'qP', or
'qL'(1).

   Like the descriptions of the other packets, each description here has
a template showing the packet's overall syntax, followed by an
explanation of the packet's meaning.  We include spaces in some of the
templates for clarity; these are not part of the packet's syntax.  No
GDB packet uses spaces to separate its components.

   Here are the currently defined query and set packets:

'QAgent:1'
'QAgent:0'
     Turn on or off the agent as a helper to perform some debugging
     operations delegated from GDB (*note Control Agent::).

'QAllow:OP:VAL...'
     Specify which operations GDB expects to request of the target, as a
     semicolon-separated list of operation name and value pairs.
     Possible values for OP include 'WriteReg', 'WriteMem',
     'InsertBreak', 'InsertTrace', 'InsertFastTrace', and 'Stop'.  VAL
     is either 0, indicating that GDB will not request the operation, or
     1, indicating that it may.  (The target can then use this to set up
     its own internals optimally, for instance if the debugger never
     expects to insert breakpoints, it may not need to install its own
     trap handler.)

'qC'
     Return the current thread ID.

     Reply:
     'QC THREAD-ID'
          Where THREAD-ID is a thread ID as documented in *note
          thread-id syntax::.
     '(anything else)'
          Any other reply implies the old thread ID.

'qCRC:ADDR,LENGTH'
     Compute the CRC checksum of a block of memory using CRC-32 defined
     in IEEE 802.3.  The CRC is computed byte at a time, taking the most
     significant bit of each byte first.  The initial pattern code
     '0xffffffff' is used to ensure leading zeros affect the CRC.

     _Note:_ This is the same CRC used in validating separate debug
     files (*note Debugging Information in Separate Files: Separate
     Debug Files.).  However the algorithm is slightly different.  When
     validating separate debug files, the CRC is computed taking the
     _least_ significant bit of each byte first, and the final result is
     inverted to detect trailing zeros.

     Reply:
     'E NN'
          An error (such as memory fault)
     'C CRC32'
          The specified memory region's checksum is CRC32.

'QDisableRandomization:VALUE'
     Some target operating systems will randomize the virtual address
     space of the inferior process as a security feature, but provide a
     feature to disable such randomization, e.g. to allow for a more
     deterministic debugging experience.  On such systems, this packet
     with a VALUE of 1 directs the target to disable address space
     randomization for processes subsequently started via 'vRun'
     packets, while a packet with a VALUE of 0 tells the target to
     enable address space randomization.

     This packet is only available in extended mode (*note extended
     mode::).

     Reply:
     'OK'
          The request succeeded.

     'E NN'
          An error occurred.  The error number NN is given as hex
          digits.

     ''
          An empty reply indicates that 'QDisableRandomization' is not
          supported by the stub.

     This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must request
     it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response (*note
     qSupported::).  This should only be done on targets that actually
     support disabling address space randomization.

'qfThreadInfo'
'qsThreadInfo'
     Obtain a list of all active thread IDs from the target (OS). Since
     there may be too many active threads to fit into one reply packet,
     this query works iteratively: it may require more than one
     query/reply sequence to obtain the entire list of threads.  The
     first query of the sequence will be the 'qfThreadInfo' query;
     subsequent queries in the sequence will be the 'qsThreadInfo'
     query.

     NOTE: This packet replaces the 'qL' query (see below).

     Reply:
     'm THREAD-ID'
          A single thread ID
     'm THREAD-ID,THREAD-ID...'
          a comma-separated list of thread IDs
     'l'
          (lower case letter 'L') denotes end of list.

     In response to each query, the target will reply with a list of one
     or more thread IDs, separated by commas.  GDB will respond to each
     reply with a request for more thread ids (using the 'qs' form of
     the query), until the target responds with 'l' (lower-case ell, for
     "last").  Refer to *note thread-id syntax::, for the format of the
     THREAD-ID fields.

     _Note: GDB will send the 'qfThreadInfo' query during the initial
     connection with the remote target, and the very first thread ID
     mentioned in the reply will be stopped by GDB in a subsequent
     message.  Therefore, the stub should ensure that the first thread
     ID in the 'qfThreadInfo' reply is suitable for being stopped by
     GDB._

'qGetTLSAddr:THREAD-ID,OFFSET,LM'
     Fetch the address associated with thread local storage specified by
     THREAD-ID, OFFSET, and LM.

     THREAD-ID is the thread ID associated with the thread for which to
     fetch the TLS address.  *Note thread-id syntax::.

     OFFSET is the (big endian, hex encoded) offset associated with the
     thread local variable.  (This offset is obtained from the debug
     information associated with the variable.)

     LM is the (big endian, hex encoded) OS/ABI-specific encoding of the
     load module associated with the thread local storage.  For example,
     a GNU/Linux system will pass the link map address of the shared
     object associated with the thread local storage under
     consideration.  Other operating environments may choose to
     represent the load module differently, so the precise meaning of
     this parameter will vary.

     Reply:
     'XX...'
          Hex encoded (big endian) bytes representing the address of the
          thread local storage requested.

     'E NN'
          An error occurred.  The error number NN is given as hex
          digits.

     ''
          An empty reply indicates that 'qGetTLSAddr' is not supported
          by the stub.

'qGetTIBAddr:THREAD-ID'
     Fetch address of the Windows OS specific Thread Information Block.

     THREAD-ID is the thread ID associated with the thread.

     Reply:
     'XX...'
          Hex encoded (big endian) bytes representing the linear address
          of the thread information block.

     'E NN'
          An error occured.  This means that either the thread was not
          found, or the address could not be retrieved.

     ''
          An empty reply indicates that 'qGetTIBAddr' is not supported
          by the stub.

'qL STARTFLAG THREADCOUNT NEXTTHREAD'
     Obtain thread information from RTOS. Where: STARTFLAG (one hex
     digit) is one to indicate the first query and zero to indicate a
     subsequent query; THREADCOUNT (two hex digits) is the maximum
     number of threads the response packet can contain; and NEXTTHREAD
     (eight hex digits), for subsequent queries (STARTFLAG is zero), is
     returned in the response as ARGTHREAD.

     Don't use this packet; use the 'qfThreadInfo' query instead (see
     above).

     Reply:
     'qM COUNT DONE ARGTHREAD THREAD...'
          Where: COUNT (two hex digits) is the number of threads being
          returned; DONE (one hex digit) is zero to indicate more
          threads and one indicates no further threads; ARGTHREADID
          (eight hex digits) is NEXTTHREAD from the request packet;
          THREAD... is a sequence of thread IDs, THREADID (eight hex
          digits), from the target.  See
          'remote.c:parse_threadlist_response()'.

'qOffsets'
     Get section offsets that the target used when relocating the
     downloaded image.

     Reply:
     'Text=XXX;Data=YYY[;Bss=ZZZ]'
          Relocate the 'Text' section by XXX from its original address.
          Relocate the 'Data' section by YYY from its original address.
          If the object file format provides segment information (e.g.
          ELF 'PT_LOAD' program headers), GDB will relocate entire
          segments by the supplied offsets.

          _Note: while a 'Bss' offset may be included in the response,
          GDB ignores this and instead applies the 'Data' offset to the
          'Bss' section._

     'TextSeg=XXX[;DataSeg=YYY]'
          Relocate the first segment of the object file, which
          conventionally contains program code, to a starting address of
          XXX.  If 'DataSeg' is specified, relocate the second segment,
          which conventionally contains modifiable data, to a starting
          address of YYY.  GDB will report an error if the object file
          does not contain segment information, or does not contain at
          least as many segments as mentioned in the reply.  Extra
          segments are kept at fixed offsets relative to the last
          relocated segment.

'qP MODE THREAD-ID'
     Returns information on THREAD-ID.  Where: MODE is a hex encoded 32
     bit mode; THREAD-ID is a thread ID (*note thread-id syntax::).

     Don't use this packet; use the 'qThreadExtraInfo' query instead
     (see below).

     Reply: see 'remote.c:remote_unpack_thread_info_response()'.

'QNonStop:1'
'QNonStop:0'
     Enter non-stop ('QNonStop:1') or all-stop ('QNonStop:0') mode.
     *Note Remote Non-Stop::, for more information.

     Reply:
     'OK'
          The request succeeded.

     'E NN'
          An error occurred.  The error number NN is given as hex
          digits.

     ''
          An empty reply indicates that 'QNonStop' is not supported by
          the stub.

     This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must request
     it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response (*note
     qSupported::).  Use of this packet is controlled by the 'set
     non-stop' command; *note Non-Stop Mode::.

'QCatchSyscalls:1 [;SYSNO]...'
'QCatchSyscalls:0'
     Enable ('QCatchSyscalls:1') or disable ('QCatchSyscalls:0')
     catching syscalls from the inferior process.

     For 'QCatchSyscalls:1', each listed syscall SYSNO (encoded in hex)
     should be reported to GDB.  If no syscall SYSNO is listed, every
     system call should be reported.

     Note that if a syscall not in the list is reported, GDB will still
     filter the event according to its own list from all corresponding
     'catch syscall' commands.  However, it is more efficient to only

     If the inferior process execs, the state of 'QCatchSyscalls' is
     kept for the new process too.  On targets where exec may affect
     syscall numbers, for example with exec between 32 and 64-bit
     processes, the client should send a new packet with the new syscall
     list.

'QPassSignals: SIGNAL [;SIGNAL]...'
     Each listed SIGNAL should be passed directly to the inferior

     stop replies (*note Stop Reply Packets::).  Each SIGNAL list item
     should be strictly greater than the previous item.  These signals
     do not need to stop the inferior, or be reported to GDB.  All other

'QProgramSignals: SIGNAL [;SIGNAL]...'
     Each listed SIGNAL may be delivered to the inferior process.
     Others should be silently discarded.

     In some cases, the remote stub may need to decide whether to
     deliver a signal to the program or not without GDB involvement.
     One example of that is while detaching -- the program's threads may
     have stopped for signals that haven't yet had a chance of being
     reported to GDB, and so the remote stub can use the signal list
     specified by this packet to know whether to deliver or ignore those
     pending signals.

     This does not influence whether to deliver a signal as requested by
     a resumption packet (*note vCont packet::).

     Signals are numbered identically to continue packets and stop

     Enable ('QThreadEvents:1') or disable ('QThreadEvents:0') reporting
     of thread create and exit events.  *Note thread create event::, for
     the reply specifications.  For example, this is used in non-stop
     mode when GDB stops a set of threads and synchronously waits for
     the their corresponding stop replies.  Without exit events, if one
     of the threads exits, GDB would hang forever not knowing that it
     should no longer expect a stop for that same thread.  GDB does not
     enable this feature unless the stub reports that it supports it by
     including 'QThreadEvents+' in its 'qSupported' reply.

'qRcmd,COMMAND'
     COMMAND (hex encoded) is passed to the local interpreter for
     execution.  Invalid commands should be reported using the output
     string.  Before the final result packet, the target may also
     respond with a number of intermediate 'OOUTPUT' console output
     packets.  _Implementors should note that providing access to a
     stubs's interpreter may have security implications_.

          connection.

'qSupported [:GDBFEATURE [;GDBFEATURE]... ]'
     Tell the remote stub about features supported by GDB, and query the
     stub for features it supports.  This packet allows GDB and the
     remote stub to take advantage of each others' features.
     'qSupported' also consolidates multiple feature probes at startup,
     to improve GDB performance--a single larger packet performs better
     than multiple smaller probe packets on high-latency links.  Some
     features may enable behavior which must not be on by default, e.g.
     because it would confuse older clients or stubs.  Other features
     may describe packets which could be automatically probed for, but
     are not.  These features must be reported before GDB will use them.
     This "default unsupported" behavior is not appropriate for all
     packets, but it helps to keep the initial connection time under
     control with new versions of GDB which support increasing numbers
     of packets.

     Reply:
     'STUBFEATURE [;STUBFEATURE]...'
          The stub supports or does not support each returned
          STUBFEATURE, depending on the form of each STUBFEATURE (see
          below for the possible forms).
     ''
          An empty reply indicates that 'qSupported' is not recognized,
          or that no features needed to be reported to GDB.

     The allowed forms for each feature (either a GDBFEATURE in the
     'qSupported' packet, or a STUBFEATURE in the response) are:

     'NAME=VALUE'
          The remote protocol feature NAME is supported, and associated
          with the specified VALUE.  The format of VALUE depends on the
          feature, but it must not include a semicolon.
     'NAME+'
          The remote protocol feature NAME is supported, and does not
          need an associated value.
     'NAME-'
          The remote protocol feature NAME is not supported.
     'NAME?'
          The remote protocol feature NAME may be supported, and GDB
          should auto-detect support in some other way when it is
          needed.  This form will not be used for GDBFEATURE
          notifications, but may be used for STUBFEATURE responses.

     Whenever the stub receives a 'qSupported' request, the supplied set
     of GDB features should override any previous request.  This allows
     GDB to put the stub in a known state, even if the stub had
     previously been communicating with a different version of GDB.

     The following values of GDBFEATURE (for the packet sent by GDB) are
     defined:

     'multiprocess'
          This feature indicates whether GDB supports multiprocess
          extensions to the remote protocol.  GDB does not use such
          extensions unless the stub also reports that it supports them
          by including 'multiprocess+' in its 'qSupported' reply.  *Note
          multiprocess extensions::, for details.

     'xmlRegisters'
          This feature indicates that GDB supports the XML target
          description.  If the stub sees 'xmlRegisters=' with target
          specific strings separated by a comma, it will report register
          description.

     'qRelocInsn'
          This feature indicates whether GDB supports the 'qRelocInsn'
          packet (*note Relocate instruction reply packet: Tracepoint
          Packets.).

     'swbreak'
          This feature indicates whether GDB supports the swbreak stop
          reason in stop replies.  *Note swbreak stop reason::, for
          details.

     'hwbreak'
          This feature indicates whether GDB supports the hwbreak stop
          reason in stop replies.  *Note swbreak stop reason::, for
          details.

     'fork-events'
          This feature indicates whether GDB supports fork event
          extensions to the remote protocol.  GDB does not use such
          extensions unless the stub also reports that it supports them
          by including 'fork-events+' in its 'qSupported' reply.

     'vfork-events'
          This feature indicates whether GDB supports vfork event
          extensions to the remote protocol.  GDB does not use such
          extensions unless the stub also reports that it supports them
          by including 'vfork-events+' in its 'qSupported' reply.

     'exec-events'
          This feature indicates whether GDB supports exec event
          extensions to the remote protocol.  GDB does not use such
          extensions unless the stub also reports that it supports them
          by including 'exec-events+' in its 'qSupported' reply.

     'vContSupported'
          This feature indicates whether GDB wants to know the supported
          actions in the reply to 'vCont?' packet.

     Stubs should ignore any unknown values for GDBFEATURE.  Any GDB
     which sends a 'qSupported' packet supports receiving packets of
     unlimited length (earlier versions of GDB may reject overly long
     responses).  Additional values for GDBFEATURE may be defined in the
     future to let the stub take advantage of new features in GDB, e.g.
     incompatible improvements in the remote protocol--the
     'multiprocess' feature is an example of such a feature.  The stub's
     reply should be independent of the GDBFEATURE entries sent by GDB;
     first GDB describes all the features it supports, and then the stub
     replies with all the features it supports.

     Similarly, GDB will silently ignore unrecognized stub feature
     responses, as long as each response uses one of the standard forms.

     Some features are flags.  A stub which supports a flag feature
     should respond with a '+' form response.  Other features require
     values, and the stub should respond with an '=' form response.

     Each feature has a default value, which GDB will use if
     'qSupported' is not available or if the feature is not mentioned in
     the 'qSupported' response.  The default values are fixed; a stub is
     free to omit any feature responses that match the defaults.

     Not all features can be probed, but for those which can, the
     probing mechanism is useful: in some cases, a stub's internal
     architecture may not allow the protocol layer to know some
     information about the underlying target in advance.  This is
     especially common in stubs which may be configured for multiple
     targets.

     These are the currently defined stub features and their properties:

     Feature Name              Value          Default   Probe

     These are the currently defined stub features, in more detail:

     'PacketSize=BYTES'
          The remote stub can accept packets up to at least BYTES in
          length.  GDB will send packets up to this size for bulk
          transfers, and will never send larger packets.  This is a
          limit on the data characters in the packet, including the
          frame and checksum.  There is no trailing NUL byte in a remote
          protocol packet; if the stub stores packets in a
          NUL-terminated format, it should allow an extra byte in its
          buffer for the NUL. If this stub feature is not supported, GDB
          guesses based on the size of the 'g' packet response.

     'qXfer:auxv:read'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:auxv:read' packet
          (*note qXfer auxiliary vector read::).

          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:btrace:read' packet
          (*note qXfer btrace read::).

     'qXfer:btrace-conf:read'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:btrace-conf:read'
          packet (*note qXfer btrace-conf read::).

     'qXfer:exec-file:read'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:exec-file:read' packet
          (*note qXfer executable filename read::).

          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:features:read' packet
          (*note qXfer target description read::).

     'qXfer:libraries:read'

          (*note qXfer library list read::).

     'qXfer:libraries-svr4:read'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:libraries-svr4:read'
          packet (*note qXfer svr4 library list read::).

     'augmented-libraries-svr4-read'
          The remote stub understands the augmented form of the
          'qXfer:libraries-svr4:read' packet (*note qXfer svr4 library
          list read::).

     'qXfer:memory-map:read'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:memory-map:read' packet
          (*note qXfer memory map read::).

     'qXfer:sdata:read'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:sdata:read' packet
          (*note qXfer sdata read::).

     'qXfer:spu:read'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:spu:read' packet (*note
          qXfer spu read::).

     'qXfer:spu:write'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:spu:write' packet
          (*note qXfer spu write::).

     'qXfer:siginfo:read'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:siginfo:read' packet
          (*note qXfer siginfo read::).

     'qXfer:siginfo:write'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:siginfo:write' packet
          (*note qXfer siginfo write::).

     'qXfer:threads:read'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:threads:read' packet
          (*note qXfer threads read::).

     'qXfer:traceframe-info:read'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:traceframe-info:read'
          packet (*note qXfer traceframe info read::).

     'qXfer:uib:read'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:uib:read' packet (*note
          qXfer unwind info block::).

     'qXfer:fdpic:read'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:fdpic:read' packet
          (*note qXfer fdpic loadmap read::).

     'QNonStop'
          The remote stub understands the 'QNonStop' packet (*note
          QNonStop::).

     'QCatchSyscalls'
          The remote stub understands the 'QCatchSyscalls' packet (*note
          QCatchSyscalls::).

     'QPassSignals'
          The remote stub understands the 'QPassSignals' packet (*note
          QPassSignals::).

     'QStartNoAckMode'
          The remote stub understands the 'QStartNoAckMode' packet and
          prefers to operate in no-acknowledgment mode.  *Note Packet
          Acknowledgment::.

     'multiprocess'
          The remote stub understands the multiprocess extensions to the
          remote protocol syntax.  The multiprocess extensions affect
          the syntax of thread IDs in both packets and replies (*note
          thread-id syntax::), and add process IDs to the 'D' packet and
          'W' and 'X' replies.  Note that reporting this feature
          indicates support for the syntactic extensions only, not that
          the stub necessarily supports debugging of more than one
          process at a time.  The stub must not use multiprocess
          extensions in packet replies unless GDB has also indicated it
          supports them in its 'qSupported' request.

     'qXfer:osdata:read'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:osdata:read' packet
          ((*note qXfer osdata read::).

     'ConditionalBreakpoints'
          The target accepts and implements evaluation of conditional
          expressions defined for breakpoints.  The target will only
          report breakpoint triggers when such conditions are true
          (*note Break Conditions: Conditions.).

     'ConditionalTracepoints'
          The remote stub accepts and implements conditional expressions
          defined for tracepoints (*note Tracepoint Conditions::).

     'ReverseContinue'
          The remote stub accepts and implements the reverse continue
          packet (*note bc::).

     'ReverseStep'
          The remote stub accepts and implements the reverse step packet
          (*note bs::).

     'TracepointSource'
          The remote stub understands the 'QTDPsrc' packet that supplies
          the source form of tracepoint definitions.

     'QAgent'
          The remote stub understands the 'QAgent' packet.

     'QAllow'
          The remote stub understands the 'QAllow' packet.

     'QDisableRandomization'
          The remote stub understands the 'QDisableRandomization'
          packet.

     'StaticTracepoint'
          The remote stub supports static tracepoints.

     'InstallInTrace'
          The remote stub supports installing tracepoint in tracing.

     'EnableDisableTracepoints'
          The remote stub supports the 'QTEnable' (*note QTEnable::) and
          'QTDisable' (*note QTDisable::) packets that allow tracepoints
          to be enabled and disabled while a trace experiment is
          running.

     'QTBuffer:size'
          The remote stub supports the 'QTBuffer:size' (*note
          QTBuffer-size::) packet that allows to change the size of the
          trace buffer.

     'tracenz'
          The remote stub supports the 'tracenz' bytecode for collecting
          strings.  See *note Bytecode Descriptions:: for details about
          the bytecode.

     'BreakpointCommands'
          The remote stub supports running a breakpoint's command list
          itself, rather than reporting the hit to GDB.

     'Qbtrace:off'
          The remote stub understands the 'Qbtrace:off' packet.

     'Qbtrace:bts'
          The remote stub understands the 'Qbtrace:bts' packet.

     'Qbtrace:pt'
          The remote stub understands the 'Qbtrace:pt' packet.

     'Qbtrace-conf:bts:size'
          The remote stub understands the 'Qbtrace-conf:bts:size'
          packet.

     'Qbtrace-conf:pt:size'
          The remote stub understands the 'Qbtrace-conf:pt:size' packet.

     'swbreak'
          The remote stub reports the 'swbreak' stop reason for memory
          breakpoints.

     'hwbreak'
          The remote stub reports the 'hwbreak' stop reason for hardware
          breakpoints.

     'fork-events'
          The remote stub reports the 'fork' stop reason for fork
          events.

     'vfork-events'
          The remote stub reports the 'vfork' stop reason for vfork
          events and vforkdone events.

     'exec-events'
          The remote stub reports the 'exec' stop reason for exec
          events.

     'vContSupported'
          The remote stub reports the supported actions in the reply to
          'vCont?' packet.

     'QThreadEvents'
          The remote stub understands the 'QThreadEvents' packet.

     'no-resumed'
          The remote stub reports the 'N' stop reply.

'qSymbol::'
     Notify the target that GDB is prepared to serve symbol lookup
     requests.  Accept requests from the target for the values of
     symbols.

     Reply:
     'OK'
          The target does not need to look up any (more) symbols.
     'qSymbol:SYM_NAME'
          The target requests the value of symbol SYM_NAME (hex
          encoded).  GDB may provide the value by using the
          'qSymbol:SYM_VALUE:SYM_NAME' message, described below.

'qSymbol:SYM_VALUE:SYM_NAME'
     Set the value of SYM_NAME to SYM_VALUE.

     SYM_NAME (hex encoded) is the name of a symbol whose value the
     target has previously requested.

     SYM_VALUE (hex) is the value for symbol SYM_NAME.  If GDB cannot
     supply a value for SYM_NAME, then this field will be empty.

     Reply:
     'OK'
          The target does not need to look up any (more) symbols.
     'qSymbol:SYM_NAME'
          The target requests the value of a new symbol SYM_NAME (hex
          encoded).  GDB will continue to supply the values of symbols
          (if available), until the target ceases to request them.

'qTBuffer'
'QTBuffer'
'QTDisconnected'
'QTDP'
'QTDPsrc'
'QTDV'
'qTfP'
'qTfV'
'QTFrame'
'qTMinFTPILen'

     *Note Tracepoint Packets::.

'qThreadExtraInfo,THREAD-ID'
     Obtain from the target OS a printable string description of thread
     attributes for the thread THREAD-ID; see *note thread-id syntax::,
     for the forms of THREAD-ID.  This string may contain anything that
     the target OS thinks is interesting for GDB to tell the user about
     the thread.  The string is displayed in GDB's 'info threads'
     display.  Some examples of possible thread extra info strings are
     'Runnable', or 'Blocked on Mutex'.

     Reply:
     'XX...'
          Where 'XX...' is a hex encoding of ASCII data, comprising the
          printable string containing the extra information about the
          thread's attributes.

     (Note that the 'qThreadExtraInfo' packet's name is separated from
     the command by a ',', not a ':', contrary to the naming conventions
     above.  Please don't use this packet as a model for new packets.)

'qXfer:OBJECT:read:ANNEX:OFFSET,LENGTH'
     Read uninterpreted bytes from the target's special data area
     identified by the keyword OBJECT.  Request LENGTH bytes starting at
     OFFSET bytes into the data.  The content and encoding of ANNEX is
     specific to OBJECT; it can supply additional details about what
     data to access.

     Reply:
     'm DATA'
          Data DATA (*note Binary Data::) has been read from the target.
          There may be more data at a higher address (although it is
          permitted to return 'm' even for the last valid block of data,
          as long as at least one byte of data was read).  It is
          possible for DATA to have fewer bytes than the LENGTH in the
          request.

     'l DATA'
          Data DATA (*note Binary Data::) has been read from the target.
          There is no more data to be read.  It is possible for DATA to
          have fewer bytes than the LENGTH in the request.

     'l'
          The OFFSET in the request is at the end of the data.  There is
          no more data to be read.

     'E00'
          The request was malformed, or ANNEX was invalid.

     'E NN'
          The offset was invalid, or there was an error encountered
          reading the data.  The NN part is a hex-encoded 'errno' value.

     ''
          An empty reply indicates the OBJECT string was not recognized
          by the stub, or that the object does not support reading.

     Here are the specific requests of this form defined so far.  All
     the 'qXfer:OBJECT:read:...' requests use the same reply formats,
     listed above.

     'qXfer:auxv:read::OFFSET,LENGTH'
          Access the target's "auxiliary vector".  *Note auxiliary
          vector: OS Information.  Note ANNEX must be empty.

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

     'qXfer:btrace:read:ANNEX:OFFSET,LENGTH'

          Return a description of the current branch trace.  *Note
          Branch Trace Format::.  The annex part of the generic 'qXfer'
          packet may have one of the following values:

          'all'
               Returns all available branch trace.

          'new'
               Returns all available branch trace if the branch trace
               changed since the last read request.

          'delta'
               Returns the new branch trace since the last read request.
               Adds a new block to the end of the trace that begins at
               zero and ends at the source location of the first branch
               in the trace buffer.  This extra block is used to stitch
               traces together.

               If the trace buffer overflowed, returns an error
               indicating the overflow.

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

     'qXfer:btrace-conf:read::OFFSET,LENGTH'

          Return a description of the current branch trace
          configuration.  *Note Branch Trace Configuration Format::.

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

     'qXfer:exec-file:read:ANNEX:OFFSET,LENGTH'
          Return the full absolute name of the file that was executed to
          create a process running on the remote system.  The annex
          specifies the numeric process ID of the process to query,
          encoded as a hexadecimal number.  If the annex part is empty
          the remote stub should return the filename corresponding to
          the currently executing process.

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

     'qXfer:features:read:ANNEX:OFFSET,LENGTH'
          Access the "target description".  *Note Target Descriptions::.
          The annex specifies which XML document to access.  The main
          description is always loaded from the 'target.xml' annex.

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

     'qXfer:libraries:read:ANNEX:OFFSET,LENGTH'
          Access the target's list of loaded libraries.  *Note Library
          List Format::.  The annex part of the generic 'qXfer' packet
          must be empty (*note qXfer read::).

          Targets which maintain a list of libraries in the program's
          memory do not need to implement this packet; it is designed
          for platforms where the operating system manages the list of
          loaded libraries.

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

     'qXfer:libraries-svr4:read:ANNEX:OFFSET,LENGTH'
          Access the target's list of loaded libraries when the target
          is an SVR4 platform.  *Note Library List Format for SVR4
          Targets::.  The annex part of the generic 'qXfer' packet must
          be empty unless the remote stub indicated it supports the
          augmented form of this packet by supplying an appropriate
          'qSupported' response (*note qXfer read::, *note
          qSupported::).

          This packet is optional for better performance on SVR4
          targets.  GDB uses memory read packets to read the SVR4
          library list otherwise.

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

          If the remote stub indicates it supports the augmented form of
          this packet then the annex part of the generic 'qXfer' packet
          may contain a semicolon-separated list of 'NAME=VALUE'
          arguments.  The currently supported arguments are:

          'start=ADDRESS'
               A hexadecimal number specifying the address of the
               'struct link_map' to start reading the library list from.
               If unset or zero then the first 'struct link_map' in the
               library list will be chosen as the starting point.

          'prev=ADDRESS'
               A hexadecimal number specifying the address of the
               'struct link_map' immediately preceding the 'struct
               link_map' specified by the 'start' argument.  If unset or
               zero then the remote stub will expect that no 'struct
               link_map' exists prior to the starting point.

          Arguments that are not understood by the remote stub will be
          silently ignored.

     'qXfer:memory-map:read::OFFSET,LENGTH'
          Access the target's "memory-map".  *Note Memory Map Format::.
          The annex part of the generic 'qXfer' packet must be empty
          (*note qXfer read::).

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

     'qXfer:sdata:read::OFFSET,LENGTH'

          Read contents of the extra collected static tracepoint marker
          information.  The annex part of the generic 'qXfer' packet
          must be empty (*note qXfer read::).  *Note Tracepoint Action
          Lists: Tracepoint Actions.

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

     'qXfer:siginfo:read::OFFSET,LENGTH'
          Read contents of the extra signal information on the target
          system.  The annex part of the generic 'qXfer' packet must be
          empty (*note qXfer read::).

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

     'qXfer:spu:read:ANNEX:OFFSET,LENGTH'
          Read contents of an 'spufs' file on the target system.  The
          annex specifies which file to read; it must be of the form
          'ID/NAME', where ID specifies an SPU context ID in the target
          process, and NAME identifes the 'spufs' file in that context
          to be accessed.

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

     'qXfer:threads:read::OFFSET,LENGTH'
          Access the list of threads on target.  *Note Thread List
          Format::.  The annex part of the generic 'qXfer' packet must
          be empty (*note qXfer read::).

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

     'qXfer:traceframe-info:read::OFFSET,LENGTH'

          Return a description of the current traceframe's contents.

          (*note qSupported::).

     'qXfer:uib:read:PC:OFFSET,LENGTH'

          Return the unwind information block for PC.  This packet is
          used on OpenVMS/ia64 to ask the kernel unwind information.

          This packet is not probed by default.

     'qXfer:fdpic:read:ANNEX:OFFSET,LENGTH'
          Read contents of 'loadmap's on the target system.  The annex,
          either 'exec' or 'interp', specifies which 'loadmap',
          executable 'loadmap' or interpreter 'loadmap' to read.

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

     'qXfer:osdata:read::OFFSET,LENGTH'
          Access the target's "operating system information".  *Note
          Operating System Information::.

'qXfer:OBJECT:write:ANNEX:OFFSET:DATA...'
     Write uninterpreted bytes into the target's special data area
     identified by the keyword OBJECT, starting at OFFSET bytes into the
     data.  The binary-encoded data (*note Binary Data::) to be written
     is given by DATA....  The content and encoding of ANNEX is specific
     to OBJECT; it can supply additional details about what data to
     access.

     Reply:
     'NN'
          NN (hex encoded) is the number of bytes written.  This may be
          fewer bytes than supplied in the request.

     'E00'
          The request was malformed, or ANNEX was invalid.

     'E NN'
          The offset was invalid, or there was an error encountered
          writing the data.  The NN part is a hex-encoded 'errno' value.

     ''
          An empty reply indicates the OBJECT string was not recognized
          by the stub, or that the object does not support writing.

     Here are the specific requests of this form defined so far.  All
     the 'qXfer:OBJECT:write:...' requests use the same reply formats,
     listed above.

     'qXfer:siginfo:write::OFFSET:DATA...'
          Write DATA to the extra signal information on the target
          system.  The annex part of the generic 'qXfer' packet must be
          empty (*note qXfer write::).

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

     'qXfer:spu:write:ANNEX:OFFSET:DATA...'
          Write DATA to an 'spufs' file on the target system.  The annex
          specifies which file to write; it must be of the form
          'ID/NAME', where ID specifies an SPU context ID in the target
          process, and NAME identifes the 'spufs' file in that context
          to be accessed.

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

'qXfer:OBJECT:OPERATION:...'
     Requests of this form may be added in the future.  When a stub does
     not recognize the OBJECT keyword, or its support for OBJECT does
     not recognize the OPERATION keyword, the stub must respond with an
     empty packet.

'qAttached:PID'
     Return an indication of whether the remote server attached to an
     existing process or created a new process.  When the multiprocess
     protocol extensions are supported (*note multiprocess
     extensions::), PID is an integer in hexadecimal format identifying
     the target process.  Otherwise, GDB will omit the PID field and the
     query packet will be simplified as 'qAttached'.

     This query is used, for example, to know whether the remote process
     should be detached or killed when a GDB session is ended with the
     'quit' command.

     Reply:
     '1'
          The remote server attached to an existing process.
     '0'
          The remote server created a new process.
     'E NN'
          A badly formed request or an error was encountered.

'Qbtrace:bts'
     Enable branch tracing for the current thread using Branch Trace
     Store.

     Reply:
     'OK'
          Branch tracing has been enabled.
     'E.errtext'

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The 'qP' and 'qL' packets predate these conventions, and have
arguments without any terminator for the packet name; we suspect they
are in widespread use in places that are difficult to upgrade.  The 'qC'
packet has no arguments, but some existing stubs (e.g. RedBoot) are
known to not check for the end of the packet.

...................................

The following 'g'/'G' packets have previously been defined.  In the
below, some thirty-two bit registers are transferred as sixty-four bits.
Those registers should be zero/sign extended (which?)  to fill the space
allocated.  Register bytes are transferred in target byte order.  The
two nibbles within a register byte are transferred most-significant -
least-significant.

MIPS32
     All registers are transferred as thirty-two bit quantities in the
     order: 32 general-purpose; sr; lo; hi; bad; cause; pc; 32
     floating-point registers; fsr; fir; fp.

MIPS64
     All registers are transferred as sixty-four bit quantities
     (including thirty-two bit registers such as 'sr').  The ordering is
     the same as 'MIPS32'.

E.6 Tracepoint Packets
======================

Here we describe the packets GDB uses to implement tracepoints (*note
Tracepoints::).

'QTDP:N:ADDR:ENA:STEP:PASS[:FFLEN][:XLEN,BYTES][-]'
     Create a new tracepoint, number N, at ADDR.  If ENA is 'E', then
     the tracepoint is enabled; if it is 'D', then the tracepoint is
     disabled.  The STEP gives the tracepoint's step count, and PASS
     gives its pass count.  If an 'F' is present, then the tracepoint is
     to be a fast tracepoint, and the FLEN is the number of bytes that
     the target should copy elsewhere to make room for the tracepoint.
     If an 'X' is present, it introduces a tracepoint condition, which
     consists of a hexadecimal length, followed by a comma and
     hex-encoded bytes, in a manner similar to action encodings as
     described below.  If the trailing '-' is present, further 'QTDP'
     packets will follow to specify this tracepoint's actions.

     Replies:
     'OK'
          The packet was understood and carried out.
     'qRelocInsn'
          *Note Relocate instruction reply packet: Tracepoint Packets.
     ''
          The packet was not recognized.

'QTDP:-N:ADDR:[S]ACTION...[-]'
     Define actions to be taken when a tracepoint is hit.  The N and
     ADDR must be the same as in the initial 'QTDP' packet for this
     tracepoint.  This packet may only be sent immediately after another
     'QTDP' packet that ended with a '-'.  If the trailing '-' is
     present, further 'QTDP' packets will follow, specifying more
     actions for this tracepoint.

     In the series of action packets for a given tracepoint, at most one
     can have an 'S' before its first ACTION.  If such a packet is sent,
     it and the following packets define "while-stepping" actions.  Any
     prior packets define ordinary actions -- that is, those taken when
     the tracepoint is first hit.  If no action packet has an 'S', then
     all the packets in the series specify ordinary tracepoint actions.

     The 'ACTION...' portion of the packet is a series of actions,
     concatenated without separators.  Each action has one of the
     following forms:

     'R MASK'
          Collect the registers whose bits are set in MASK, a
          hexadecimal number whose I'th bit is set if register number I
          should be collected.  (The least significant bit is numbered
          zero.)  Note that MASK may be any number of digits long; it
          may not fit in a 32-bit word.

     'M BASEREG,OFFSET,LEN'
          Collect LEN bytes of memory starting at the address in
          register number BASEREG, plus OFFSET.  If BASEREG is '-1',
          then the range has a fixed address: OFFSET is the address of
          the lowest byte to collect.  The BASEREG, OFFSET, and LEN
          parameters are all unsigned hexadecimal values (the '-1' value
          for BASEREG is a special case).

     'X LEN,EXPR'
          Evaluate EXPR, whose length is LEN, and collect memory as it
          directs.  The agent expression EXPR is as described in *note
          Agent Expressions::.  Each byte of the expression is encoded
          as a two-digit hex number in the packet; LEN is the number of
          bytes in the expression (and thus one-half the number of hex
          digits in the packet).

     Any number of actions may be packed together in a single 'QTDP'
     packet, as long as the packet does not exceed the maximum packet
     length (400 bytes, for many stubs).  There may be only one 'R'
     action per tracepoint, and it must precede any 'M' or 'X' actions.
     Any registers referred to by 'M' and 'X' actions must be collected
     by a preceding 'R' action.  (The "while-stepping" actions are
     treated as if they were attached to a separate tracepoint, as far
     as these restrictions are concerned.)

     Replies:
     'OK'
          The packet was understood and carried out.
     'qRelocInsn'
          *Note Relocate instruction reply packet: Tracepoint Packets.
     ''
          The packet was not recognized.

'QTDPsrc:N:ADDR:TYPE:START:SLEN:BYTES'
     Specify a source string of tracepoint N at address ADDR.  This is
     useful to get accurate reproduction of the tracepoints originally
     downloaded at the beginning of the trace run.  The TYPE is the name
     of the tracepoint part, such as 'cond' for the tracepoint's
     conditional expression (see below for a list of types), while BYTES
     is the string, encoded in hexadecimal.

     START is the offset of the BYTES within the overall source string,
     while SLEN is the total length of the source string.  This is
     intended for handling source strings that are longer than will fit
     in a single packet.

     The available string types are 'at' for the location, 'cond' for
     the conditional, and 'cmd' for an action command.  GDB sends a
     separate packet for each command in the action list, in the same
     order in which the commands are stored in the list.

     The target does not need to do anything with source strings except
     report them back as part of the replies to the 'qTfP'/'qTsP' query
     packets.

     Although this packet is optional, and GDB will only send it if the
     target replies with 'TracepointSource' *Note General Query
     Packets::, it makes both disconnected tracing and trace files much
     easier to use.  Otherwise the user must be careful that the
     tracepoints in effect while looking at trace frames are identical
     to the ones in effect during the trace run; even a small
     discrepancy could cause 'tdump' not to work, or a particular trace
     frame not be found.

'QTDV:N:VALUE:BUILTIN:NAME'
     Create a new trace state variable, number N, with an initial value
     of VALUE, which is a 64-bit signed integer.  Both N and VALUE are
     encoded as hexadecimal values.  GDB has the option of not using
     this packet for initial values of zero; the target should simply
     create the trace state variables as they are mentioned in
     expressions.  The value BUILTIN should be 1 (one) if the trace
     state variable is builtin and 0 (zero) if it is not builtin.  GDB
     only sets BUILTIN to 1 if a previous 'qTfV' or 'qTsV' packet had it
     set.  The contents of NAME is the hex-encoded name (without the
     leading '$') of the trace state variable.

'QTFrame:N'
     Select the N'th tracepoint frame from the buffer, and use the
     register and memory contents recorded there to answer subsequent
     request packets from GDB.

     A successful reply from the stub indicates that the stub has found
     the requested frame.  The response is a series of parts,
     concatenated without separators, describing the frame we selected.
     Each part has one of the following forms:

     'F F'
          The selected frame is number N in the trace frame buffer; F is
          a hexadecimal number.  If F is '-1', then there was no frame
          matching the criteria in the request packet.

     'T T'
          The selected trace frame records a hit of tracepoint number T;
          T is a hexadecimal number.

'QTFrame:pc:ADDR'
     Like 'QTFrame:N', but select the first tracepoint frame after the
     currently selected frame whose PC is ADDR; ADDR is a hexadecimal
     number.

'QTFrame:tdp:T'
     Like 'QTFrame:N', but select the first tracepoint frame after the
     currently selected frame that is a hit of tracepoint T; T is a
     hexadecimal number.

'QTFrame:range:START:END'
     Like 'QTFrame:N', but select the first tracepoint frame after the
     currently selected frame whose PC is between START (inclusive) and
     END (inclusive); START and END are hexadecimal numbers.

'QTFrame:outside:START:END'
     Like 'QTFrame:range:START:END', but select the first frame
     _outside_ the given range of addresses (exclusive).

'qTMinFTPILen'
     This packet requests the minimum length of instruction at which a
     fast tracepoint (*note Set Tracepoints::) may be placed.  For
     instance, on the 32-bit x86 architecture, it is possible to use a
     4-byte jump, but it depends on the target system being able to
     create trampolines in the first 64K of memory, which might or might
     not be possible for that system.  So the reply to this packet will
     be 4 if it is able to arrange for that.

     Replies:

     '0'
          The minimum instruction length is currently unknown.
     'LENGTH'
          The minimum instruction length is LENGTH, where LENGTH is a
          hexadecimal number greater or equal to 1.  A reply of 1 means
          that a fast tracepoint may be placed on any instruction
          regardless of size.
     'E'
          An error has occurred.
     ''
          An empty reply indicates that the request is not supported by
          the stub.

'QTStart'
     Begin the tracepoint experiment.  Begin collecting data from
     tracepoint hits in the trace frame buffer.  This packet supports
     the 'qRelocInsn' reply (*note Relocate instruction reply packet:
     Tracepoint Packets.).

'QTStop'
     End the tracepoint experiment.  Stop collecting trace frames.

'QTEnable:N:ADDR'
     Enable tracepoint N at address ADDR in a started tracepoint
     experiment.  If the tracepoint was previously disabled, then
     collection of data from it will resume.

'QTDisable:N:ADDR'
     Disable tracepoint N at address ADDR in a started tracepoint
     experiment.  No more data will be collected from the tracepoint
     unless 'QTEnable:N:ADDR' is subsequently issued.

'QTinit'
     Clear the table of tracepoints, and empty the trace frame buffer.

'QTro:START1,END1:START2,END2:...'
     Establish the given ranges of memory as "transparent".  The stub
     will answer requests for these ranges from memory's current
     contents, if they were not collected as part of the tracepoint hit.

     GDB uses this to mark read-only regions of memory, like those
     containing program code.  Since these areas never change, they
     should still have the same contents they did when the tracepoint
     was hit, so there's no reason for the stub to refuse to provide
     their contents.

'QTDisconnected:VALUE'
     Set the choice to what to do with the tracing run when GDB
     disconnects from the target.  A VALUE of 1 directs the target to
     continue the tracing run, while 0 tells the target to stop tracing
     if GDB is no longer in the picture.

'qTStatus'
     Ask the stub if there is a trace experiment running right now.

     The reply has the form:

     'TRUNNING[;FIELD]...'
          RUNNING is a single digit '1' if the trace is presently
          running, or '0' if not.  It is followed by semicolon-separated
          optional fields that an agent may use to report additional
          status.

     If the trace is not running, the agent may report any of several
     explanations as one of the optional fields:

     'tnotrun:0'
          No trace has been run yet.

     'tstop[:TEXT]:0'
          The trace was stopped by a user-originated stop command.  The
          optional TEXT field is a user-supplied string supplied as part
          of the stop command (for instance, an explanation of why the
          trace was stopped manually).  It is hex-encoded.

     'tfull:0'
          The trace stopped because the trace buffer filled up.

     'tdisconnected:0'
          The trace stopped because GDB disconnected from the target.

     'tpasscount:TPNUM'
          The trace stopped because tracepoint TPNUM exceeded its pass
          count.

     'terror:TEXT:TPNUM'
          The trace stopped because tracepoint TPNUM had an error.  The
          string TEXT is available to describe the nature of the error
          (for instance, a divide by zero in the condition expression);
          it is hex encoded.

     'tunknown:0'
          The trace stopped for some other reason.

     Additional optional fields supply statistical and other
     information.  Although not required, they are extremely useful for
     users monitoring the progress of a trace run.  If a trace has
     stopped, and these numbers are reported, they must reflect the
     state of the just-stopped trace.

     'tframes:N'
          The number of trace frames in the buffer.

     'tcreated:N'
          The total number of trace frames created during the run.  This
          may be larger than the trace frame count, if the buffer is
          circular.

     'tsize:N'
          The total size of the trace buffer, in bytes.

     'tfree:N'
          The number of bytes still unused in the buffer.

     'circular:N'
          The value of the circular trace buffer flag.  '1' means that
          the trace buffer is circular and old trace frames will be
          discarded if necessary to make room, '0' means that the trace
          buffer is linear and may fill up.

     'disconn:N'
          The value of the disconnected tracing flag.  '1' means that
          tracing will continue after GDB disconnects, '0' means that
          the trace run will stop.

'qTP:TP:ADDR'
     Ask the stub for the current state of tracepoint number TP at
     address ADDR.

     Replies:
     'VHITS:USAGE'
          The tracepoint has been hit HITS times so far during the trace
          run, and accounts for USAGE in the trace buffer.  Note that
          'while-stepping' steps are not counted as separate hits, but
          the steps' space consumption is added into the usage number.

'qTV:VAR'
     Ask the stub for the value of the trace state variable number VAR.

     Replies:
     'VVALUE'
          The value of the variable is VALUE.  This will be the current
          value of the variable if the user is examining a running
          target, or a saved value if the variable was collected in the
          trace frame that the user is looking at.  Note that multiple
          requests may result in different reply values, such as when
          requesting values while the program is running.

     'U'
          The value of the variable is unknown.  This would occur, for
          example, if the user is examining a trace frame in which the
          requested variable was not collected.

'qTfP'
'qTsP'
     These packets request data about tracepoints that are being used by
     the target.  GDB sends 'qTfP' to get the first piece of data, and
     multiple 'qTsP' to get additional pieces.  Replies to these packets
     generally take the form of the 'QTDP' packets that define
     tracepoints.  (FIXME add detailed syntax)

'qTfV'
'qTsV'
     These packets request data about trace state variables that are on
     the target.  GDB sends 'qTfV' to get the first vari of data, and
     multiple 'qTsV' to get additional variables.  Replies to these
     packets follow the syntax of the 'QTDV' packets that define trace
     state variables.

'qTfSTM'
'qTsSTM'
     These packets request data about static tracepoint markers that
     exist in the target program.  GDB sends 'qTfSTM' to get the first
     piece of data, and multiple 'qTsSTM' to get additional pieces.
     Replies to these packets take the following form:

     Reply:
     'm ADDRESS:ID:EXTRA'
          A single marker
     'm ADDRESS:ID:EXTRA,ADDRESS:ID:EXTRA...'
          a comma-separated list of markers
     'l'
          (lower case letter 'L') denotes end of list.
     'E NN'
          An error occurred.  The error number NN is given as hex
          digits.
     ''
          An empty reply indicates that the request is not supported by
          the stub.

     The ADDRESS is encoded in hex; ID and EXTRA are strings encoded in
     hex.

     In response to each query, the target will reply with a list of one
     or more markers, separated by commas.  GDB will respond to each
     reply with a request for more markers (using the 'qs' form of the
     query), until the target responds with 'l' (lower-case ell, for
     "last").

'qTSTMat:ADDRESS'
     This packets requests data about static tracepoint markers in the
     target program at ADDRESS.  Replies to this packet follow the
     syntax of the 'qTfSTM' and 'qTsSTM' packets that list static
     tracepoint markers.

'QTSave:FILENAME'
     This packet directs the target to save trace data to the file name
     FILENAME in the target's filesystem.  The FILENAME is encoded as a
     hex string; the interpretation of the file name (relative vs
     absolute, wild cards, etc) is up to the target.

'qTBuffer:OFFSET,LEN'
     Return up to LEN bytes of the current contents of trace buffer,
     starting at OFFSET.  The trace buffer is treated as if it were a
     contiguous collection of traceframes, as per the trace file format.
     The reply consists as many hex-encoded bytes as the target can
     deliver in a packet; it is not an error to return fewer than were
     asked for.  A reply consisting of just 'l' indicates that no bytes
     are available.

'QTBuffer:circular:VALUE'
     This packet directs the target to use a circular trace buffer if
     VALUE is 1, or a linear buffer if the value is 0.

'QTBuffer:size:SIZE'
     This packet directs the target to make the trace buffer be of size
     SIZE if possible.  A value of '-1' tells the target to use whatever
     size it prefers.

'QTNotes:[TYPE:TEXT][;TYPE:TEXT]...'
     This packet adds optional textual notes to the trace run.
     Allowable types include 'user', 'notes', and 'tstop', the TEXT
     fields are arbitrary strings, hex-encoded.

E.6.1 Relocate instruction reply packet
---------------------------------------

When installing fast tracepoints in memory, the target may need to
relocate the instruction currently at the tracepoint address to a
different address in memory.  For most instructions, a simple copy is
enough, but, for example, call instructions that implicitly push the
return address on the stack, and relative branches or other PC-relative
instructions require offset adjustment, so that the effect of executing
the instruction at a different address is the same as if it had executed
in the original location.

   In response to several of the tracepoint packets, the target may also
respond with a number of intermediate 'qRelocInsn' request packets
before the final result packet, to have GDB handle this relocation
operation.  If a packet supports this mechanism, its documentation will
explicitly say so.  See for example the above descriptions for the
'QTStart' and 'QTDP' packets.  The format of the request is:

'qRelocInsn:FROM;TO'

     This requests GDB to copy instruction at address FROM to address
     TO, possibly adjusted so that executing the instruction at TO has
     the same effect as executing it at FROM.  GDB writes the adjusted
     instruction to target memory starting at TO.

   Replies:
'qRelocInsn:ADJUSTED_SIZE'
     Informs the stub the relocation is complete.  The ADJUSTED_SIZE is
     the length in bytes of resulting relocated instruction sequence.
'E NN'
     A badly formed request was detected, or an error was encountered
     while relocating the instruction.

E.7 Host I/O Packets
====================

The "Host I/O" packets allow GDB to perform I/O operations on the far
side of a remote link.  For example, Host I/O is used to upload and
download files to a remote target with its own filesystem.  Host I/O
uses the same constant values and data structure layout as the
target-initiated File-I/O protocol.  However, the Host I/O packets are
structured differently.  The target-initiated protocol relies on target
memory to store parameters and buffers.  Host I/O requests are initiated
by GDB, and the target's memory is not involved.  *Note File-I/O Remote
Protocol Extension::, for more details on the target-initiated protocol.

   The Host I/O request packets all encode a single operation along with
its arguments.  They have this format:

'vFile:OPERATION: PARAMETER...'
     OPERATION is the name of the particular request; the target should
     compare the entire packet name up to the second colon when checking
     for a supported operation.  The format of PARAMETER depends on the
     operation.  Numbers are always passed in hexadecimal.  Negative
     numbers have an explicit minus sign (i.e. two's complement is not
     used).  Strings (e.g. filenames) are encoded as a series of
     hexadecimal bytes.  The last argument to a system call may be a
     buffer of escaped binary data (*note Binary Data::).

   The valid responses to Host I/O packets are:

'F RESULT [, ERRNO] [; ATTACHMENT]'
     RESULT is the integer value returned by this operation, usually
     non-negative for success and -1 for errors.  If an error has
     occured, ERRNO will be included in the result specifying a value
     defined by the File-I/O protocol (*note Errno Values::).  For
     operations which return data, ATTACHMENT supplies the data as a
     binary buffer.  Binary buffers in response packets are escaped in
     the normal way (*note Binary Data::).  See the individual packet
     documentation for the interpretation of RESULT and ATTACHMENT.

''
     An empty response indicates that this operation is not recognized.

   These are the supported Host I/O operations:

'vFile:open: FILENAME, FLAGS, MODE'
     Open a file at FILENAME and return a file descriptor for it, or
     return -1 if an error occurs.  The FILENAME is a string, FLAGS is
     an integer indicating a mask of open flags (*note Open Flags::),
     and MODE is an integer indicating a mask of mode bits to use if the
     file is created (*note mode_t Values::).  *Note open::, for details
     of the open flags and mode values.

'vFile:close: FD'
     Close the open file corresponding to FD and return 0, or -1 if an
     error occurs.

'vFile:pread: FD, COUNT, OFFSET'
     Read data from the open file corresponding to FD.  Up to COUNT
     bytes will be read from the file, starting at OFFSET relative to
     the start of the file.  The target may read fewer bytes; common
     reasons include packet size limits and an end-of-file condition.
     The number of bytes read is returned.  Zero should only be returned
     for a successful read at the end of the file, or if COUNT was zero.

     The data read should be returned as a binary attachment on success.
     If zero bytes were read, the response should include an empty
     binary attachment (i.e. a trailing semicolon).  The return value is
     the number of target bytes read; the binary attachment may be
     longer if some characters were escaped.

'vFile:pwrite: FD, OFFSET, DATA'
     Write DATA (a binary buffer) to the open file corresponding to FD.
     Start the write at OFFSET from the start of the file.  Unlike many
     'write' system calls, there is no separate COUNT argument; the
     length of DATA in the packet is used.  'vFile:write' returns the
     number of bytes written, which may be shorter than the length of
     DATA, or -1 if an error occurred.

'vFile:fstat: FD'
     Get information about the open file corresponding to FD.  On
     success the information is returned as a binary attachment and the
     return value is the size of this attachment in bytes.  If an error
     occurs the return value is -1.  The format of the returned binary
     attachment is as described in *note struct stat::.

'vFile:unlink: FILENAME'
     Delete the file at FILENAME on the target.  Return 0, or -1 if an
     error occurs.  The FILENAME is a string.

'vFile:readlink: FILENAME'
     Read value of symbolic link FILENAME on the target.  Return the
     number of bytes read, or -1 if an error occurs.

     The data read should be returned as a binary attachment on success.
     If zero bytes were read, the response should include an empty
     binary attachment (i.e. a trailing semicolon).  The return value is
     the number of target bytes read; the binary attachment may be
     longer if some characters were escaped.

'vFile:setfs: PID'
     Select the filesystem on which 'vFile' operations with FILENAME
     arguments will operate.  This is required for GDB to be able to
     access files on remote targets where the remote stub does not share
     a common filesystem with the inferior(s).

     If PID is nonzero, select the filesystem as seen by process PID.
     If PID is zero, select the filesystem as seen by the remote stub.
     Return 0 on success, or -1 if an error occurs.  If 'vFile:setfs:'
     indicates success, the selected filesystem remains selected until
     the next successful 'vFile:setfs:' operation.

E.8 Interrupts
==============

In all-stop mode, when a program on the remote target is running, GDB
may attempt to interrupt it by sending a 'Ctrl-C', 'BREAK' or a 'BREAK'
followed by 'g', control of which is specified via GDB's
'interrupt-sequence'.

   The precise meaning of 'BREAK' is defined by the transport mechanism
and may, in fact, be undefined.  GDB does not currently define a 'BREAK'
mechanism for any of the network interfaces except for TCP, in which
case GDB sends the 'telnet' BREAK sequence.

   'Ctrl-C', on the other hand, is defined and implemented for all
transport mechanisms.  It is represented by sending the single byte
'0x03' without any of the usual packet overhead described in the
Overview section (*note Overview::).  When a '0x03' byte is transmitted
as part of a packet, it is considered to be packet data and does _not_
represent an interrupt.  E.g., an 'X' packet (*note X packet::), used
for binary downloads, may include an unescaped '0x03' as part of its
packet.

   'BREAK' followed by 'g' is also known as Magic SysRq g.  When Linux
kernel receives this sequence from serial port, it stops execution and
connects to gdb.

   In non-stop mode, because packet resumptions are asynchronous (*note
vCont packet::), GDB is always free to send a remote command to the
remote stub, even when the target is running.  For that reason, GDB
instead sends a regular packet (*note vCtrlC packet::) with the usual
packet framing instead of the single byte '0x03'.

   Stubs are not required to recognize these interrupt mechanisms and
the precise meaning associated with receipt of the interrupt is
implementation defined.  If the target supports debugging of multiple
threads and/or processes, it should attempt to interrupt all
currently-executing threads and processes.  If the stub is successful at
interrupting the running program, it should send one of the stop reply
packets (*note Stop Reply Packets::) to GDB as a result of successfully
stopping the program in all-stop mode, and a stop reply for each stopped
thread in non-stop mode.  Interrupts received while the program is
stopped are queued and the program will be interrupted when it is
resumed next time.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Notification Packets,  Next: Remote Non-Stop,  Prev: Interrupts,  Up: Remote Protocol

E.9 Notification Packets
========================

The GDB remote serial protocol includes "notifications", packets that
require no acknowledgment.  Both the GDB and the stub may send
notifications (although the only notifications defined at present are
sent by the stub).  Notifications carry information without incurring
the round-trip latency of an acknowledgment, and so are useful for
low-impact communications where occasional packet loss is not a problem.

   A notification packet has the form '% DATA # CHECKSUM', where DATA is
the content of the notification, and CHECKSUM is a checksum of DATA,
computed and formatted as for ordinary GDB packets.  A notification's
DATA never contains '$', '%' or '#' characters.  Upon receiving a
notification, the recipient sends no '+' or '-' to acknowledge the
notification's receipt or to report its corruption.

   Every notification's DATA begins with a name, which contains no colon
characters, followed by a colon character.

   Recipients should silently ignore corrupted notifications and
notifications they do not understand.  Recipients should restart timeout
periods on receipt of a well-formed notification, whether or not they
understand it.

   Senders should only send the notifications described here when this
protocol description specifies that they are permitted.  In the future,
we may extend the protocol to permit existing notifications in new
contexts; this rule helps older senders avoid confusing newer
recipients.

   (Older versions of GDB ignore bytes received until they see the '$'
byte that begins an ordinary packet, so new stubs may transmit
notifications without fear of confusing older clients.  There are no
notifications defined for GDB to send at the moment, but we assume that
most older stubs would ignore them, as well.)

   Each notification is comprised of three parts:
'NAME:EVENT'
     The notification packet is sent by the side that initiates the
     exchange (currently, only the stub does that), with EVENT carrying
     the specific information about the notification, and NAME
     specifying the name of the notification.
'ACK'
     The acknowledge sent by the other side, usually GDB, to acknowledge
     the exchange and request the event.

   The purpose of an asynchronous notification mechanism is to report to
GDB that something interesting happened in the remote stub.

   The remote stub may send notification NAME:EVENT at any time, but GDB
acknowledges the notification when appropriate.  The notification event
is pending before GDB acknowledges.  Only one notification at a time may
be pending; if additional events occur before GDB has acknowledged the
previous notification, they must be queued by the stub for later
synchronous transmission in response to ACK packets from GDB.  Because
the notification mechanism is unreliable, the stub is permitted to
resend a notification if it believes GDB may not have received it.

   Specifically, notifications may appear when GDB is not otherwise
reading input from the stub, or when GDB is expecting to read a normal
synchronous response or a '+'/'-' acknowledgment to a packet it has
sent.  Notification packets are distinct from any other communication
from the stub so there is no ambiguity.

   After receiving a notification, GDB shall acknowledge it by sending a
ACK packet as a regular, synchronous request to the stub.  Such
acknowledgment is not required to happen immediately, as GDB is
permitted to send other, unrelated packets to the stub first, which the
stub should process normally.

   Upon receiving a ACK packet, if the stub has other queued events to
report to GDB, it shall respond by sending a normal EVENT.  GDB shall
then send another ACK packet to solicit further responses; again, it is
permitted to send other, unrelated packets as well which the stub should
process normally.

   If the stub receives a ACK packet and there are no additional EVENT
to report, the stub shall return an 'OK' response.  At this point, GDB
has finished processing a notification and the stub has completed
sending any queued events.  GDB won't accept any new notifications until
the final 'OK' is received .  If further notification events occur, the
stub shall send a new notification, GDB shall accept the notification,
and the process shall be repeated.

   The process of asynchronous notification can be illustrated by the
following example:
     <- %Stop:T0505:98e7ffbf;04:4ce6ffbf;08:b1b6e54c;thread:p7526.7526;core:0;
     ...
     -> vStopped
     <- T0505:68f37db7;04:40f37db7;08:63850408;thread:p7526.7528;core:0;
     -> vStopped
     <- T0505:68e3fdb6;04:40e3fdb6;08:63850408;thread:p7526.7529;core:0;
     -> vStopped
     <- OK

   The following notifications are defined:

NotificationAck     Event                       Description
                                                
Stop      vStopped  REPLY.  The REPLY has the   Report an asynchronous
                    form of a stop reply, as    stop event in non-stop
                    described in                mode.
                    *note Stop Reply Packets::. 
                    Refer to
                    *note Remote Non-Stop::,
                    for information on how
                    these notifications are
                    acknowledged by GDB.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Remote Non-Stop,  Next: Packet Acknowledgment,  Prev: Notification Packets,  Up: Remote Protocol

E.10 Remote Protocol Support for Non-Stop Mode
==============================================

GDB's remote protocol supports non-stop debugging of multi-threaded
programs, as described in *note Non-Stop Mode::.  If the stub supports
non-stop mode, it should report that to GDB by including 'QNonStop+' in
its 'qSupported' response (*note qSupported::).

   GDB typically sends a 'QNonStop' packet only when establishing a new
connection with the stub.  Entering non-stop mode does not alter the
state of any currently-running threads, but targets must stop all
threads in any already-attached processes when entering all-stop mode.
GDB uses the '?' packet as necessary to probe the target state after a
mode change.

   In non-stop mode, when an attached process encounters an event that
would otherwise be reported with a stop reply, it uses the asynchronous
notification mechanism (*note Notification Packets::) to inform GDB.  In
contrast to all-stop mode, where all threads in all processes are
stopped when a stop reply is sent, in non-stop mode only the thread
reporting the stop event is stopped.  That is, when reporting a 'S' or
'T' response to indicate completion of a step operation, hitting a
breakpoint, or a fault, only the affected thread is stopped; any other
still-running threads continue to run.  When reporting a 'W' or 'X'
response, all running threads belonging to other attached processes
continue to run.

   In non-stop mode, the target shall respond to the '?' packet as
follows.  First, any incomplete stop reply notification/'vStopped'
sequence in progress is abandoned.  The target must begin a new sequence
reporting stop events for all stopped threads, whether or not it has
previously reported those events to GDB.  The first stop reply is sent
as a synchronous reply to the '?' packet, and subsequent stop replies
are sent as responses to 'vStopped' packets using the mechanism
described above.  The target must not send asynchronous stop reply
notifications until the sequence is complete.  If all threads are
running when the target receives the '?' packet, or if the target is not
attached to any process, it shall respond 'OK'.

   If the stub supports non-stop mode, it should also support the
'swbreak' stop reason if software breakpoints are supported, and the
'hwbreak' stop reason if hardware breakpoints are supported (*note
swbreak stop reason::).  This is because given the asynchronous nature
of non-stop mode, between the time a thread hits a breakpoint and the
time the event is finally processed by GDB, the breakpoint may have
already been removed from the target.  Due to this, GDB needs to be able
to tell whether a trap stop was caused by a delayed breakpoint event,
which should be ignored, as opposed to a random trap signal, which
should be reported to the user.  Note the 'swbreak' feature implies that
the target is responsible for adjusting the PC when a software
breakpoint triggers, if necessary, such as on the x86 architecture.

E.11 Packet Acknowledgment
==========================

By default, when either the host or the target machine receives a
packet, the first response expected is an acknowledgment: either '+' (to
indicate the package was received correctly) or '-' (to request
retransmission).  This mechanism allows the GDB remote protocol to
operate over unreliable transport mechanisms, such as a serial line.

   In cases where the transport mechanism is itself reliable (such as a
pipe or TCP connection), the '+'/'-' acknowledgments are redundant.  It
may be desirable to disable them in that case to reduce communication
overhead, or for other reasons.  This can be accomplished by means of
the 'QStartNoAckMode' packet; *note QStartNoAckMode::.

   When in no-acknowledgment mode, neither the stub nor GDB shall send
or expect '+'/'-' protocol acknowledgments.  The packet and response
format still includes the normal checksum, as described in *note
Overview::, but the checksum may be ignored by the receiver.

   If the stub supports 'QStartNoAckMode' and prefers to operate in
no-acknowledgment mode, it should report that to GDB by including
'QStartNoAckMode+' in its response to 'qSupported'; *note qSupported::.
If GDB also supports 'QStartNoAckMode' and it has not been disabled via
the 'set remote noack-packet off' command (*note Remote
Configuration::), GDB may then send a 'QStartNoAckMode' packet to the
stub.  Only then may the stub actually turn off packet acknowledgments.
GDB sends a final '+' acknowledgment of the stub's 'OK' response, which
can be safely ignored by the stub.

   Note that 'set remote noack-packet' command only affects negotiation
between GDB and the stub when subsequent connections are made; it does
not affect the protocol acknowledgment state for any current connection.
Since '+'/'-' acknowledgments are enabled by default when a new
connection is established, there is also no protocol request to
re-enable the acknowledgments for the current connection, once disabled.

E.13.1 File-I/O Overview
------------------------

The "File I/O remote protocol extension" (short: File-I/O) allows the
target to use the host's file system and console I/O to perform various
system calls.  System calls on the target system are translated into a
remote protocol packet to the host system, which then performs the
needed actions and returns a response packet to the target system.  This
simulates file system operations even on targets that lack file systems.

   The protocol is defined to be independent of both the host and target
systems.  It uses its own internal representation of datatypes and
values.  Both GDB and the target's GDB stub are responsible for
translating the system-dependent value representations into the internal
protocol representations when data is transmitted.

   The communication is synchronous.  A system call is possible only
when GDB is waiting for a response from the 'C', 'c', 'S' or 's'
packets.  While GDB handles the request for a system call, the target is
stopped to allow deterministic access to the target's memory.  Therefore
File-I/O is not interruptible by target signals.  On the other hand, it
is possible to interrupt File-I/O by a user interrupt ('Ctrl-C') within
GDB.

   The target's request to perform a host system call does not finish
the latest 'C', 'c', 'S' or 's' action.  That means, after finishing the
system call, the target returns to continuing the previous activity
(continue, step).  No additional continue or step request from GDB is
required.

     (gdb) continue
       <- target requests 'system call X'
       target is stopped, GDB executes system call
       -> GDB returns result
       ... target continues, GDB returns to wait for the target
       <- target hits breakpoint and sends a Txx packet

   The protocol only supports I/O on the console and to regular files on
the host file system.  Character or block special devices, pipes, named
pipes, sockets or any other communication method on the host system are
not supported by this protocol.

   File I/O is not supported in non-stop mode.

E.13.2 Protocol Basics
----------------------

The File-I/O protocol uses the 'F' packet as the request as well as
reply packet.  Since a File-I/O system call can only occur when GDB is
waiting for a response from the continuing or stepping target, the
File-I/O request is a reply that GDB has to expect as a result of a
previous 'C', 'c', 'S' or 's' packet.  This 'F' packet contains all
information needed to allow GDB to call the appropriate host system
call:

   * A unique identifier for the requested system call.

   * All parameters to the system call.  Pointers are given as addresses
     in the target memory address space.  Pointers to strings are given
     as pointer/length pair.  Numerical values are given as they are.
     Numerical control flags are given in a protocol-specific
     representation.

   At this point, GDB has to perform the following actions.

   * If the parameters include pointer values to data needed as input to
     a system call, GDB requests this data from the target with a
     standard 'm' packet request.  This additional communication has to
     be expected by the target implementation and is handled as any
     other 'm' packet.

   * GDB translates all value from protocol representation to host
     representation as needed.  Datatypes are coerced into the host
     types.

   * GDB calls the system call.

   * It then coerces datatypes back to protocol representation.

   * If the system call is expected to return data in buffer space
     specified by pointer parameters to the call, the data is
     transmitted to the target using a 'M' or 'X' packet.  This packet
     has to be expected by the target implementation and is handled as
     any other 'M' or 'X' packet.

   Eventually GDB replies with another 'F' packet which contains all
necessary information for the target to continue.  This at least
contains

   * Return value.

   * 'errno', if has been changed by the system call.

   * "Ctrl-C" flag.

   After having done the needed type and value coercion, the target
continues the latest continue or step action.

E.13.3 The 'F' Request Packet
-----------------------------

The 'F' request packet has the following format:

'FCALL-ID,PARAMETER...'

     CALL-ID is the identifier to indicate the host system call to be
     called.  This is just the name of the function.

     PARAMETER... are the parameters to the system call.  Parameters are
     hexadecimal integer values, either the actual values in case of
     scalar datatypes, pointers to target buffer space in case of
     compound datatypes and unspecified memory areas, or pointer/length
     pairs in case of string parameters.  These are appended to the
     CALL-ID as a comma-delimited list.  All values are transmitted in
     ASCII string representation, pointer/length pairs separated by a
     slash.


File: gdb.info,  Node: The F Reply Packet,  Next: The Ctrl-C Message,  Prev: The F Request Packet,  Up: File-I/O Remote Protocol Extension

E.13.4 The 'F' Reply Packet
---------------------------

The 'F' reply packet has the following format:

'FRETCODE,ERRNO,CTRL-C FLAG;CALL-SPECIFIC ATTACHMENT'

     RETCODE is the return code of the system call as hexadecimal value.

     ERRNO is the 'errno' set by the call, in protocol-specific
     representation.  This parameter can be omitted if the call was
     successful.

     CTRL-C FLAG is only sent if the user requested a break.  In this
     case, ERRNO must be sent as well, even if the call was successful.
     The CTRL-C FLAG itself consists of the character 'C':

          F0,0,C

     or, if the call was interrupted before the host call has been
     performed:

          F-1,4,C

     assuming 4 is the protocol-specific representation of 'EINTR'.


File: gdb.info,  Node: The Ctrl-C Message,  Next: Console I/O,  Prev: The F Reply Packet,  Up: File-I/O Remote Protocol Extension

E.13.5 The 'Ctrl-C' Message
---------------------------

If the 'Ctrl-C' flag is set in the GDB reply packet (*note The F Reply
Packet::), the target should behave as if it had gotten a break message.
The meaning for the target is "system call interrupted by 'SIGINT'".
Consequentially, the target should actually stop (as with a break
message) and return to GDB with a 'T02' packet.

   It's important for the target to know in which state the system call
was interrupted.  There are two possible cases:

   * The system call hasn't been performed on the host yet.

   * The system call on the host has been finished.

   These two states can be distinguished by the target by the value of
the returned 'errno'.  If it's the protocol representation of 'EINTR',
the system call hasn't been performed.  This is equivalent to the
'EINTR' handling on POSIX systems.  In any other case, the target may
presume that the system call has been finished -- successfully or not --
and should behave as if the break message arrived right after the system
call.

   GDB must behave reliably.  If the system call has not been called
yet, GDB may send the 'F' reply immediately, setting 'EINTR' as 'errno'
in the packet.  If the system call on the host has been finished before
the user requests a break, the full action must be finished by GDB.
This requires sending 'M' or 'X' packets as necessary.  The 'F' packet
may only be sent when either nothing has happened or the full action has
been completed.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Console I/O,  Next: List of Supported Calls,  Prev: The Ctrl-C Message,  Up: File-I/O Remote Protocol Extension

E.13.6 Console I/O
------------------

By default and if not explicitly closed by the target system, the file
descriptors 0, 1 and 2 are connected to the GDB console.  Output on the
GDB console is handled as any other file output operation ('write(1,
...)' or 'write(2, ...)').  Console input is handled by GDB so that
after the target read request from file descriptor 0 all following
typing is buffered until either one of the following conditions is met:

   * The user types 'Ctrl-c'.  The behaviour is as explained above, and
     the 'read' system call is treated as finished.

   * The user presses <RET>.  This is treated as end of input with a
     trailing newline.

   * The user types 'Ctrl-d'.  This is treated as end of input.  No
     trailing character (neither newline nor 'Ctrl-D') is appended to
     the input.

   If the user has typed more characters than fit in the buffer given to
the 'read' call, the trailing characters are buffered in GDB until
either another 'read(0, ...)' is requested by the target, or debugging
is stopped at the user's request.

   GDB takes over the full task of calling the necessary host calls to
perform the 'system' call.  The return value of 'system' on the host is
simplified before it's returned to the target.  Any termination signal
information from the child process is discarded, and the return value
consists entirely of the exit status of the called command.

   Due to security concerns, the 'system' call is by default refused by
GDB.  The user has to allow this call explicitly with the 'set remote
system-call-allowed 1' command.

'set remote system-call-allowed'
     Control whether to allow the 'system' calls in the File I/O
     protocol for the remote target.  The default is zero (disabled).

File: gdb.info,  Node: Integral Datatypes,  Next: Pointer Values,  Up: Protocol-specific Representation of Datatypes

Integral Datatypes
..................

The integral datatypes used in the system calls are 'int', 'unsigned
int', 'long', 'unsigned long', 'mode_t', and 'time_t'.

   'int', 'unsigned int', 'mode_t' and 'time_t' are implemented as 32
bit values in this protocol.

   'long' and 'unsigned long' are implemented as 64 bit types.

   *Note Limits::, for corresponding MIN and MAX values (similar to
those in 'limits.h') to allow range checking on host and target.

   'time_t' datatypes are defined as seconds since the Epoch.

   All integral datatypes transferred as part of a memory read or write
of a structured datatype e.g. a 'struct stat' have to be given in big
endian byte order.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Pointer Values,  Next: Memory Transfer,  Prev: Integral Datatypes,  Up: Protocol-specific Representation of Datatypes

Pointer Values
..............

Pointers to target data are transmitted as they are.  An exception is
made for pointers to buffers for which the length isn't transmitted as
part of the function call, namely strings.  Strings are transmitted as a
pointer/length pair, both as hex values, e.g.

     1aaf/12

which is a pointer to data of length 18 bytes at position 0x1aaf.  The
length is defined as the full string length in bytes, including the
trailing null byte.  For example, the string '"hello world"' at address
0x123456 is transmitted as

     123456/d


File: gdb.info,  Node: Memory Transfer,  Next: struct stat,  Prev: Pointer Values,  Up: Protocol-specific Representation of Datatypes

Memory Transfer
...............

Structured data which is transferred using a memory read or write (for
example, a 'struct stat') is expected to be in a protocol-specific
format with all scalar multibyte datatypes being big endian.
Translation to this representation needs to be done both by the target
before the 'F' packet is sent, and by GDB before it transfers memory to
the target.  Transferred pointers to structured data should point to the
already-coerced data at any time.


File: gdb.info,  Node: struct stat,  Next: struct timeval,  Prev: Memory Transfer,  Up: Protocol-specific Representation of Datatypes

struct stat
...........

The buffer of type 'struct stat' used by the target and GDB is defined
as follows:

     struct stat {
         unsigned int  st_dev;      /* device */
         unsigned int  st_ino;      /* inode */
         mode_t        st_mode;     /* protection */
         unsigned int  st_nlink;    /* number of hard links */
         unsigned int  st_uid;      /* user ID of owner */
         unsigned int  st_gid;      /* group ID of owner */
         unsigned int  st_rdev;     /* device type (if inode device) */
         unsigned long st_size;     /* total size, in bytes */
         unsigned long st_blksize;  /* blocksize for filesystem I/O */
         unsigned long st_blocks;   /* number of blocks allocated */
         time_t        st_atime;    /* time of last access */
         time_t        st_mtime;    /* time of last modification */
         time_t        st_ctime;    /* time of last change */
     };

   The integral datatypes conform to the definitions given in the
appropriate section (see *note Integral Datatypes::, for details) so
this structure is of size 64 bytes.

   The values of several fields have a restricted meaning and/or range
of values.

'st_dev'
     A value of 0 represents a file, 1 the console.

'st_ino'
     No valid meaning for the target.  Transmitted unchanged.

'st_mode'
     Valid mode bits are described in *note Constants::.  Any other bits
     have currently no meaning for the target.

'st_uid'
'st_gid'
'st_rdev'
     No valid meaning for the target.  Transmitted unchanged.

'st_atime'
'st_mtime'
'st_ctime'
     These values have a host and file system dependent accuracy.
     Especially on Windows hosts, the file system may not support exact
     timing values.

   The target gets a 'struct stat' of the above representation and is
responsible for coercing it to the target representation before
continuing.

   Note that due to size differences between the host, target, and
protocol representations of 'struct stat' members, these members could
eventually get truncated on the target.

struct timeval
..............

The buffer of type 'struct timeval' used by the File-I/O protocol is
defined as follows:

     struct timeval {
         time_t tv_sec;  /* second */
         long   tv_usec; /* microsecond */
     };

   The integral datatypes conform to the definitions given in the
appropriate section (see *note Integral Datatypes::, for details) so
this structure is of size 8 bytes.

E.14 Library List Format
========================

On some platforms, a dynamic loader (e.g. 'ld.so') runs in the same
process as your application to manage libraries.  In this case, GDB can
use the loader's symbol table and normal memory operations to maintain a
list of shared libraries.  On other platforms, the operating system
manages loaded libraries.  GDB can not retrieve the list of currently
loaded libraries through memory operations, so it uses the
'qXfer:libraries:read' packet (*note qXfer library list read::) instead.
The remote stub queries the target's operating system and reports which
libraries are loaded.

   The 'qXfer:libraries:read' packet returns an XML document which lists
loaded libraries and their offsets.  Each library has an associated name
and one or more segment or section base addresses, which report where
the library was loaded in memory.

   For the common case of libraries that are fully linked binaries, the
library should have a list of segments.  If the target supports dynamic
linking of a relocatable object file, its library XML element should
instead include a list of allocated sections.  The segment or section
bases are start addresses, not relocation offsets; they do not depend on
the library's link-time base addresses.

   GDB must be linked with the Expat library to support XML library
lists.  *Note Expat::.

   A simple memory map, with one loaded library relocated by a single
offset, looks like this:

     <library-list>
       <library name="/lib/libc.so.6">
         <segment address="0x10000000"/>
       </library>
     </library-list>

   Another simple memory map, with one loaded library with three
allocated sections (.text, .data, .bss), looks like this:

     <library-list>
       <library name="sharedlib.o">
         <section address="0x10000000"/>
         <section address="0x20000000"/>
         <section address="0x30000000"/>
       </library>
     </library-list>

   The format of a library list is described by this DTD:

     <!-- library-list: Root element with versioning -->
     <!ELEMENT library-list  (library)*>
     <!ATTLIST library-list  version CDATA   #FIXED  "1.0">
     <!ELEMENT library       (segment*, section*)>
     <!ATTLIST library       name    CDATA   #REQUIRED>
     <!ELEMENT segment       EMPTY>
     <!ATTLIST segment       address CDATA   #REQUIRED>
     <!ELEMENT section       EMPTY>
     <!ATTLIST section       address CDATA   #REQUIRED>

   In addition, segments and section descriptors cannot be mixed within
a single library element, and you must supply at least one segment or
section for each library.

E.15 Library List Format for SVR4 Targets
=========================================

On SVR4 platforms GDB can use the symbol table of a dynamic loader (e.g.
'ld.so') and normal memory operations to maintain a list of shared
libraries.  Still a special library list provided by this packet is more
efficient for the GDB remote protocol.

   The 'qXfer:libraries-svr4:read' packet returns an XML document which
lists loaded libraries and their SVR4 linker parameters.  For each
library on SVR4 target, the following parameters are reported:

   - 'name', the absolute file name from the 'l_name' field of 'struct
     link_map'.
   - 'lm' with address of 'struct link_map' used for TLS (Thread Local
     Storage) access.
   - 'l_addr', the displacement as read from the field 'l_addr' of
     'struct link_map'.  For prelinked libraries this is not an absolute
     memory address.  It is a displacement of absolute memory address
     against address the file was prelinked to during the library load.
   - 'l_ld', which is memory address of the 'PT_DYNAMIC' segment

   Additionally the single 'main-lm' attribute specifies address of
'struct link_map' used for the main executable.  This parameter is used
for TLS access and its presence is optional.

   GDB must be linked with the Expat library to support XML SVR4 library
lists.  *Note Expat::.

   A simple memory map, with two loaded libraries (which do not use
prelink), looks like this:

     <library-list-svr4 version="1.0" main-lm="0xe4f8f8">
       <library name="/lib/ld-linux.so.2" lm="0xe4f51c" l_addr="0xe2d000"
                l_ld="0xe4eefc"/>
       <library name="/lib/libc.so.6" lm="0xe4fbe8" l_addr="0x154000"
                l_ld="0x152350"/>
     </library-list-svr>

   The format of an SVR4 library list is described by this DTD:

     <!-- library-list-svr4: Root element with versioning -->
     <!ELEMENT library-list-svr4  (library)*>
     <!ATTLIST library-list-svr4  version CDATA   #FIXED  "1.0">
     <!ATTLIST library-list-svr4  main-lm CDATA   #IMPLIED>

E.16 Memory Map Format
======================

To be able to write into flash memory, GDB needs to obtain a memory map
from the target.  This section describes the format of the memory map.

   The memory map is obtained using the 'qXfer:memory-map:read' (*note
qXfer memory map read::) packet and is an XML document that lists memory
regions.

   GDB must be linked with the Expat library to support XML memory maps.
*Note Expat::.

   The top-level structure of the document is shown below:

     <?xml version="1.0"?>
     <!DOCTYPE memory-map
               PUBLIC "+//IDN gnu.org//DTD GDB Memory Map V1.0//EN"
                      "http://sourceware.org/gdb/gdb-memory-map.dtd">
     <memory-map>
         region...
     </memory-map>

   Each region can be either:

   * A region of RAM starting at ADDR and extending for LENGTH bytes
     from there:

          <memory type="ram" start="ADDR" length="LENGTH"/>

   * A region of read-only memory:

          <memory type="rom" start="ADDR" length="LENGTH"/>

   * A region of flash memory, with erasure blocks BLOCKSIZE bytes in
     length:

          <memory type="flash" start="ADDR" length="LENGTH">
            <property name="blocksize">BLOCKSIZE</property>
          </memory>

   Regions must not overlap.  GDB assumes that areas of memory not
covered by the memory map are RAM, and uses the ordinary 'M' and 'X'
packets to write to addresses in such ranges.

   The formal DTD for memory map format is given below:

     <!-- ................................................... -->
     <!-- Memory Map XML DTD ................................ -->
     <!-- File: memory-map.dtd .............................. -->
     <!-- .................................... .............. -->

     <!ELEMENT memory (property)>
     <!-- memory: Specifies a memory region,
                  and its type, or device. -->
     <!ATTLIST memory        type    CDATA   #REQUIRED

E.17 Thread List Format
=======================

To efficiently update the list of threads and their attributes, GDB
issues the 'qXfer:threads:read' packet (*note qXfer threads read::) and
obtains the XML document with the following structure:

     <?xml version="1.0"?>
     <threads>
         <thread id="id" core="0" name="name">
         ... description ...
         </thread>
     </threads>

   Each 'thread' element must have the 'id' attribute that identifies
the thread (*note thread-id syntax::).  The 'core' attribute, if
present, specifies which processor core the thread was last executing
on.  The 'name' attribute, if present, specifies the human-readable name
of the thread.  The content of the of 'thread' element is interpreted as
human-readable auxiliary information.

E.18 Traceframe Info Format
===========================

To be able to know which objects in the inferior can be examined when
inspecting a tracepoint hit, GDB needs to obtain the list of memory
ranges, registers and trace state variables that have been collected in
a traceframe.

   This list is obtained using the 'qXfer:traceframe-info:read' (*note
qXfer traceframe info read::) packet and is an XML document.

   GDB must be linked with the Expat library to support XML traceframe
info discovery.  *Note Expat::.

   The top-level structure of the document is shown below:

     <?xml version="1.0"?>
     <!DOCTYPE traceframe-info

     <traceframe-info>
        block...
     </traceframe-info>

   Each traceframe block can be either:

   * A region of collected memory starting at ADDR and extending for
     LENGTH bytes from there:

          <memory start="ADDR" length="LENGTH"/>

   * A block indicating trace state variable numbered NUMBER has been
     collected:

          <tvar id="NUMBER"/>

   The formal DTD for the traceframe info format is given below:

E.19 Branch Trace Format
========================

In order to display the branch trace of an inferior thread, GDB needs to
obtain the list of branches.  This list is represented as list of
sequential code blocks that are connected via branches.  The code in
each block has been executed sequentially.

   This list is obtained using the 'qXfer:btrace:read' (*note qXfer
btrace read::) packet and is an XML document.

   GDB must be linked with the Expat library to support XML traceframe
info discovery.  *Note Expat::.

Appendix F The GDB Agent Expression Mechanism
*********************************************

In some applications, it is not feasible for the debugger to interrupt
the program's execution long enough for the developer to learn anything
helpful about its behavior.  If the program's correctness depends on its
real-time behavior, delays introduced by a debugger might cause the
program to fail, even when the code itself is correct.  It is useful to
be able to observe the program's behavior without interrupting it.

   Using GDB's 'trace' and 'collect' commands, the user can specify
locations in the program, and arbitrary expressions to evaluate when
those locations are reached.  Later, using the 'tfind' command, she can
examine the values those expressions had when the program hit the trace
points.  The expressions may also denote objects in memory -- structures
or arrays, for example -- whose values GDB should record; while visiting
a particular tracepoint, the user may inspect those objects as if they
were in memory at that moment.  However, because GDB records these
values without interacting with the user, it can do so quickly and
unobtrusively, hopefully not disturbing the program's behavior.

   When GDB is debugging a remote target, the GDB "agent" code running
on the target computes the values of the expressions itself.  To avoid
having a full symbolic expression evaluator on the agent, GDB translates
expressions in the source language into a simpler bytecode language, and
then sends the bytecode to the agent; the agent then executes the
bytecode, and records the values for GDB to retrieve later.

   The bytecode language is simple; there are forty-odd opcodes, the
bulk of which are the usual vocabulary of C operands (addition,
subtraction, shifts, and so on) and various sizes of literals and memory
reference operations.  The bytecode interpreter operates strictly on
machine-level values -- various sizes of integers and floating point
numbers -- and requires no information about types or symbols; thus, the
interpreter's internal data structures are simple, and each bytecode
requires only a few native machine instructions to implement it.  The
interpreter is small, and strict limits on the memory and time required
to evaluate an expression are easy to determine, making it suitable for
use by the debugging agent in real-time applications.

F.1 General Bytecode Design
===========================

The agent represents bytecode expressions as an array of bytes.  Each
instruction is one byte long (thus the term "bytecode").  Some
instructions are followed by operand bytes; for example, the 'goto'
instruction is followed by a destination for the jump.

   The bytecode interpreter is a stack-based machine; most instructions
pop their operands off the stack, perform some operation, and push the
result back on the stack for the next instruction to consume.  Each
element of the stack may contain either a integer or a floating point
value; these values are as many bits wide as the largest integer that
can be directly manipulated in the source language.  Stack elements
carry no record of their type; bytecode could push a value as an
integer, then pop it as a floating point value.  However, GDB will not
generate code which does this.  In C, one might define the type of a
stack element as follows:
     union agent_val {
       LONGEST l;
       DOUBLEST d;
     };
where 'LONGEST' and 'DOUBLEST' are 'typedef' names for the largest
integer and floating point types on the machine.

   By the time the bytecode interpreter reaches the end of the
expression, the value of the expression should be the only value left on
the stack.  For tracing applications, 'trace' bytecodes in the
expression will have recorded the necessary data, and the value on the
stack may be discarded.  For other applications, like conditional
breakpoints, the value may be useful.

   Separate from the stack, the interpreter has two registers:
'pc'
     The address of the next bytecode to execute.

'start'
     The address of the start of the bytecode expression, necessary for
     interpreting the 'goto' and 'if_goto' instructions.

Neither of these registers is directly visible to the bytecode language
itself, but they are useful for defining the meanings of the bytecode
operations.

   There are no instructions to perform side effects on the running
program, or call the program's functions; we assume that these
expressions are only used for unobtrusive debugging, not for patching
the running code.

   Most bytecode instructions do not distinguish between the various
sizes of values, and operate on full-width values; the upper bits of the
values are simply ignored, since they do not usually make a difference
to the value computed.  The exceptions to this rule are:

memory reference instructions ('ref'N)
     There are distinct instructions to fetch different word sizes from
     memory.  Once on the stack, however, the values are treated as
     full-size integers.  They may need to be sign-extended; the 'ext'
     instruction exists for this purpose.

the sign-extension instruction ('ext' N)
     These clearly need to know which portion of their operand is to be
     extended to occupy the full length of the word.

   If the interpreter is unable to evaluate an expression completely for
some reason (a memory location is inaccessible, or a divisor is zero,
for example), we say that interpretation "terminates with an error".
This means that the problem is reported back to the interpreter's caller
in some helpful way.  In general, code using agent expressions should
assume that they may attempt to divide by zero, fetch arbitrary memory
locations, and misbehave in other ways.

   Even complicated C expressions compile to a few bytecode
instructions; for example, the expression 'x + y * z' would typically
produce code like the following, assuming that 'x' and 'y' live in
registers, and 'z' is a global variable holding a 32-bit 'int':
     reg 1
     reg 2
     const32 address of z
     ref32
     ext 32
     mul
     add
     end

   In detail, these mean:

'reg 1'
     Push the value of register 1 (presumably holding 'x') onto the
     stack.

'reg 2'
     Push the value of register 2 (holding 'y').

'const32 address of z'
     Push the address of 'z' onto the stack.

'ref32'
     Fetch a 32-bit word from the address at the top of the stack;
     replace the address on the stack with the value.  Thus, we replace
     the address of 'z' with 'z''s value.

'ext 32'
     Sign-extend the value on the top of the stack from 32 bits to full
     length.  This is necessary because 'z' is a signed integer.

'mul'
     Pop the top two numbers on the stack, multiply them, and push their
     product.  Now the top of the stack contains the value of the
     expression 'y * z'.

'add'
     Pop the top two numbers, add them, and push the sum.  Now the top
     of the stack contains the value of 'x + y * z'.

'end'
     Stop executing; the value left on the stack top is the value to be
     recorded.

F.2 Bytecode Descriptions
=========================

Each bytecode description has the following form:

'add' (0x02): A B => A+B

     Pop the top two stack items, A and B, as integers; push their sum,
     as an integer.

   In this example, 'add' is the name of the bytecode, and '(0x02)' is
the one-byte value used to encode the bytecode, in hexadecimal.  The
phrase "A B => A+B" shows the stack before and after the bytecode
executes.  Beforehand, the stack must contain at least two values, A and
B; since the top of the stack is to the right, B is on the top of the
stack, and A is underneath it.  After execution, the bytecode will have
popped A and B from the stack, and replaced them with a single value,
A+B.  There may be other values on the stack below those shown, but the
bytecode affects only those shown.

   Here is another example:

'const8' (0x22) N: => N
     Push the 8-bit integer constant N on the stack, without sign
     extension.

   In this example, the bytecode 'const8' takes an operand N directly
from the bytecode stream; the operand follows the 'const8' bytecode
itself.  We write any such operands immediately after the name of the
bytecode, before the colon, and describe the exact encoding of the
operand in the bytecode stream in the body of the bytecode description.

   For the 'const8' bytecode, there are no stack items given before the
=>; this simply means that the bytecode consumes no values from the
stack.  If a bytecode consumes no values, or produces no values, the
list on either side of the => may be empty.

   If a value is written as A, B, or N, then the bytecode treats it as
an integer.  If a value is written is ADDR, then the bytecode treats it
as an address.

   We do not fully describe the floating point operations here; although
this design can be extended in a clean way to handle floating point
values, they are not of immediate interest to the customer, so we avoid
describing them, to save time.

'float' (0x01): =>

     Prefix for floating-point bytecodes.  Not implemented yet.

'add' (0x02): A B => A+B
     Pop two integers from the stack, and push their sum, as an integer.

'sub' (0x03): A B => A-B
     Pop two integers from the stack, subtract the top value from the
     next-to-top value, and push the difference.

'mul' (0x04): A B => A*B
     Pop two integers from the stack, multiply them, and push the
     product on the stack.  Note that, when one multiplies two N-bit
     numbers yielding another N-bit number, it is irrelevant whether the
     numbers are signed or not; the results are the same.

'div_signed' (0x05): A B => A/B
     Pop two signed integers from the stack; divide the next-to-top
     value by the top value, and push the quotient.  If the divisor is
     zero, terminate with an error.

'div_unsigned' (0x06): A B => A/B
     Pop two unsigned integers from the stack; divide the next-to-top
     value by the top value, and push the quotient.  If the divisor is
     zero, terminate with an error.

'rem_signed' (0x07): A B => A MODULO B
     Pop two signed integers from the stack; divide the next-to-top
     value by the top value, and push the remainder.  If the divisor is
     zero, terminate with an error.

'rem_unsigned' (0x08): A B => A MODULO B
     Pop two unsigned integers from the stack; divide the next-to-top
     value by the top value, and push the remainder.  If the divisor is
     zero, terminate with an error.

'lsh' (0x09): A B => A<<B
     Pop two integers from the stack; let A be the next-to-top value,
     and B be the top value.  Shift A left by B bits, and push the
     result.

'rsh_signed' (0x0a): A B => '(signed)'A>>B
     Pop two integers from the stack; let A be the next-to-top value,
     and B be the top value.  Shift A right by B bits, inserting copies
     of the top bit at the high end, and push the result.

'rsh_unsigned' (0x0b): A B => A>>B
     Pop two integers from the stack; let A be the next-to-top value,
     and B be the top value.  Shift A right by B bits, inserting zero
     bits at the high end, and push the result.

'log_not' (0x0e): A => !A
     Pop an integer from the stack; if it is zero, push the value one;
     otherwise, push the value zero.

'bit_and' (0x0f): A B => A&B
     Pop two integers from the stack, and push their bitwise 'and'.

'bit_or' (0x10): A B => A|B
     Pop two integers from the stack, and push their bitwise 'or'.

'bit_xor' (0x11): A B => A^B
     Pop two integers from the stack, and push their bitwise
     exclusive-'or'.

'bit_not' (0x12): A => ~A
     Pop an integer from the stack, and push its bitwise complement.

'equal' (0x13): A B => A=B
     Pop two integers from the stack; if they are equal, push the value
     one; otherwise, push the value zero.

'less_signed' (0x14): A B => A<B
     Pop two signed integers from the stack; if the next-to-top value is
     less than the top value, push the value one; otherwise, push the
     value zero.

'less_unsigned' (0x15): A B => A<B
     Pop two unsigned integers from the stack; if the next-to-top value
     is less than the top value, push the value one; otherwise, push the
     value zero.

'ext' (0x16) N: A => A, sign-extended from N bits
     Pop an unsigned value from the stack; treating it as an N-bit
     twos-complement value, extend it to full length.  This means that
     all bits to the left of bit N-1 (where the least significant bit is
     bit 0) are set to the value of bit N-1.  Note that N may be larger
     than or equal to the width of the stack elements of the bytecode
     engine; in this case, the bytecode should have no effect.

     The number of source bits to preserve, N, is encoded as a single
     byte unsigned integer following the 'ext' bytecode.

'zero_ext' (0x2a) N: A => A, zero-extended from N bits
     Pop an unsigned value from the stack; zero all but the bottom N
     bits.

     The number of source bits to preserve, N, is encoded as a single
     byte unsigned integer following the 'zero_ext' bytecode.

'ref8' (0x17): ADDR => A
'ref16' (0x18): ADDR => A
'ref32' (0x19): ADDR => A
'ref64' (0x1a): ADDR => A
     Pop an address ADDR from the stack.  For bytecode 'ref'N, fetch an
     N-bit value from ADDR, using the natural target endianness.  Push
     the fetched value as an unsigned integer.

     Note that ADDR may not be aligned in any particular way; the 'refN'
     bytecodes should operate correctly for any address.

     If attempting to access memory at ADDR would cause a processor
     exception of some sort, terminate with an error.

'ref_float' (0x1b): ADDR => D
'ref_double' (0x1c): ADDR => D
'ref_long_double' (0x1d): ADDR => D
'l_to_d' (0x1e): A => D
'd_to_l' (0x1f): D => A
     Not implemented yet.

'dup' (0x28): A => A A
     Push another copy of the stack's top element.

'swap' (0x2b): A B => B A
     Exchange the top two items on the stack.

'pop' (0x29): A =>
     Discard the top value on the stack.

'pick' (0x32) N: A ... B => A ... B A
     Duplicate an item from the stack and push it on the top of the
     stack.  N, a single byte, indicates the stack item to copy.  If N
     is zero, this is the same as 'dup'; if N is one, it copies the item
     under the top item, etc.  If N exceeds the number of items on the
     stack, terminate with an error.

'rot' (0x33): A B C => C B A
     Rotate the top three items on the stack.

'if_goto' (0x20) OFFSET: A =>
     Pop an integer off the stack; if it is non-zero, branch to the
     given offset in the bytecode string.  Otherwise, continue to the
     next instruction in the bytecode stream.  In other words, if A is
     non-zero, set the 'pc' register to 'start' + OFFSET.  Thus, an
     offset of zero denotes the beginning of the expression.

     The OFFSET is stored as a sixteen-bit unsigned value, stored
     immediately following the 'if_goto' bytecode.  It is always stored
     most significant byte first, regardless of the target's normal
     endianness.  The offset is not guaranteed to fall at any particular
     alignment within the bytecode stream; thus, on machines where
     fetching a 16-bit on an unaligned address raises an exception, you
     should fetch the offset one byte at a time.

'goto' (0x21) OFFSET: =>
     Branch unconditionally to OFFSET; in other words, set the 'pc'
     register to 'start' + OFFSET.

     The offset is stored in the same way as for the 'if_goto' bytecode.

'const8' (0x22) N: => N
'const16' (0x23) N: => N
'const32' (0x24) N: => N
'const64' (0x25) N: => N
     Push the integer constant N on the stack, without sign extension.
     To produce a small negative value, push a small twos-complement
     value, and then sign-extend it using the 'ext' bytecode.

     The constant N is stored in the appropriate number of bytes
     following the 'const'B bytecode.  The constant N is always stored
     most significant byte first, regardless of the target's normal
     endianness.  The constant is not guaranteed to fall at any
     particular alignment within the bytecode stream; thus, on machines
     where fetching a 16-bit on an unaligned address raises an
     exception, you should fetch N one byte at a time.

'reg' (0x26) N: => A
     Push the value of register number N, without sign extension.  The
     registers are numbered following GDB's conventions.

     The register number N is encoded as a 16-bit unsigned integer
     immediately following the 'reg' bytecode.  It is always stored most
     significant byte first, regardless of the target's normal
     endianness.  The register number is not guaranteed to fall at any
     particular alignment within the bytecode stream; thus, on machines
     where fetching a 16-bit on an unaligned address raises an
     exception, you should fetch the register number one byte at a time.

'getv' (0x2c) N: => V
     Push the value of trace state variable number N, without sign
     extension.

     The variable number N is encoded as a 16-bit unsigned integer
     immediately following the 'getv' bytecode.  It is always stored
     most significant byte first, regardless of the target's normal
     endianness.  The variable number is not guaranteed to fall at any
     particular alignment within the bytecode stream; thus, on machines
     where fetching a 16-bit on an unaligned address raises an
     exception, you should fetch the register number one byte at a time.

'setv' (0x2d) N: V => V
     Set trace state variable number N to the value found on the top of
     the stack.  The stack is unchanged, so that the value is readily
     available if the assignment is part of a larger expression.  The
     handling of N is as described for 'getv'.

'trace' (0x0c): ADDR SIZE =>
     Record the contents of the SIZE bytes at ADDR in a trace buffer,
     for later retrieval by GDB.

'trace_quick' (0x0d) SIZE: ADDR => ADDR
     Record the contents of the SIZE bytes at ADDR in a trace buffer,
     for later retrieval by GDB. SIZE is a single byte unsigned integer
     following the 'trace' opcode.

     This bytecode is equivalent to the sequence 'dup const8 SIZE
     trace', but we provide it anyway to save space in bytecode strings.

'trace16' (0x30) SIZE: ADDR => ADDR
     Identical to trace_quick, except that SIZE is a 16-bit big-endian
     unsigned integer, not a single byte.  This should probably have
     been named 'trace_quick16', for consistency.

'tracev' (0x2e) N: => A
     Record the value of trace state variable number N in the trace
     buffer.  The handling of N is as described for 'getv'.

'tracenz' (0x2f) ADDR SIZE =>
     Record the bytes at ADDR in a trace buffer, for later retrieval by
     GDB. Stop at either the first zero byte, or when SIZE bytes have
     been recorded, whichever occurs first.

'printf' (0x34) NUMARGS STRING =>
     Do a formatted print, in the style of the C function 'printf').
     The value of NUMARGS is the number of arguments to expect on the
     stack, while STRING is the format string, prefixed with a two-byte
     length.  The last byte of the string must be zero, and is included
     in the length.  The format string includes escaped sequences just
     as it appears in C source, so for instance the format string
     '"\t%d\n"' is six characters long, and the output will consist of a
     tab character, a decimal number, and a newline.  At the top of the
     stack, above the values to be printed, this bytecode will pop a
     "function" and "channel".  If the function is nonzero, then the
     target may treat it as a function and call it, passing the channel
     as a first argument, as with the C function 'fprintf'.  If the
     function is zero, then the target may simply call a standard
     formatted print function of its choice.  In all, this bytecode pops
     2 + NUMARGS stack elements, and pushes nothing.

'end' (0x27): =>
     Stop executing bytecode; the result should be the top element of
     the stack.  If the purpose of the expression was to compute an
     lvalue or a range of memory, then the next-to-top of the stack is
     the lvalue's address, and the top of the stack is the lvalue's
     size, in bytes.

F.3 Using Agent Expressions
===========================

Agent expressions can be used in several different ways by GDB, and the
debugger can generate different bytecode sequences as appropriate.

   One possibility is to do expression evaluation on the target rather
than the host, such as for the conditional of a conditional tracepoint.
In such a case, GDB compiles the source expression into a bytecode
sequence that simply gets values from registers or memory, does
arithmetic, and returns a result.

   Another way to use agent expressions is for tracepoint data
collection.  GDB generates a different bytecode sequence for collection;
in addition to bytecodes that do the calculation, GDB adds 'trace'
bytecodes to save the pieces of memory that were used.

   * The user selects trace points in the program's code at which GDB
     should collect data.

   * The user specifies expressions to evaluate at each trace point.
     These expressions may denote objects in memory, in which case those
     objects' contents are recorded as the program runs, or computed
     values, in which case the values themselves are recorded.

   * GDB transmits the tracepoints and their associated expressions to
     the GDB agent, running on the debugging target.

   * The agent arranges to be notified when a trace point is hit.

   * When execution on the target reaches a trace point, the agent
     evaluates the expressions associated with that trace point, and
     records the resulting values and memory ranges.

   * Later, when the user selects a given trace event and inspects the
     objects and expression values recorded, GDB talks to the agent to
     retrieve recorded data as necessary to meet the user's requests.
     If the user asks to see an object whose contents have not been
     recorded, GDB reports an error.

F.4 Varying Target Capabilities
===============================

Some targets don't support floating-point, and some would rather not
have to deal with 'long long' operations.  Also, different targets will
have different stack sizes, and different bytecode buffer lengths.

   Thus, GDB needs a way to ask the target about itself.  We haven't
worked out the details yet, but in general, GDB should be able to send
the target a packet asking it to describe itself.  The reply should be a
packet whose length is explicit, so we can add new information to the
packet in future revisions of the agent, without confusing old versions
of GDB, and it should contain a version number.  It should contain at
least the following information:

   * whether floating point is supported

   * whether 'long long' is supported

   * maximum acceptable size of bytecode stack

   * maximum acceptable length of bytecode expressions

   * which registers are actually available for collection

   * whether the target supports disabled tracepoints


File: gdb.info,  Node: Rationale,  Prev: Varying Target Capabilities,  Up: Agent Expressions

F.5 Rationale
=============

Some of the design decisions apparent above are arguable.

What about stack overflow/underflow?
     GDB should be able to query the target to discover its stack size.
     Given that information, GDB can determine at translation time
     whether a given expression will overflow the stack.  But this spec
     isn't about what kinds of error-checking GDB ought to do.

Why are you doing everything in LONGEST?

     Speed isn't important, but agent code size is; using LONGEST brings
     in a bunch of support code to do things like division, etc.  So
     this is a serious concern.

     First, note that you don't need different bytecodes for different
     operand sizes.  You can generate code without _knowing_ how big the
     stack elements actually are on the target.  If the target only
     supports 32-bit ints, and you don't send any 64-bit bytecodes,
     everything just works.  The observation here is that the MIPS and
     the Alpha have only fixed-size registers, and you can still get C's
     semantics even though most instructions only operate on full-sized
     words.  You just need to make sure everything is properly
     sign-extended at the right times.  So there is no need for 32- and
     64-bit variants of the bytecodes.  Just implement everything using
     the largest size you support.

     GDB should certainly check to see what sizes the target supports,
     so the user can get an error earlier, rather than later.  But this
     information is not necessary for correctness.

Why don't you have '>' or '<=' operators?
     I want to keep the interpreter small, and we don't need them.  We
     can combine the 'less_' opcodes with 'log_not', and swap the order
     of the operands, yielding all four asymmetrical comparison
     operators.  For example, '(x <= y)' is '! (x > y)', which is '! (y
     < x)'.

Why do you have 'log_not'?
Why do you have 'ext'?
Why do you have 'zero_ext'?
     These are all easily synthesized from other instructions, but I
     expect them to be used frequently, and they're simple, so I include
     them to keep bytecode strings short.

     'log_not' is equivalent to 'const8 0 equal'; it's used in half the
     relational operators.

     'ext N' is equivalent to 'const8 S-N lsh const8 S-N rsh_signed',
     where S is the size of the stack elements; it follows 'refM' and
     REG bytecodes when the value should be signed.  See the next
     bulleted item.

     'zero_ext N' is equivalent to 'constM MASK log_and'; it's used
     whenever we push the value of a register, because we can't assume
     the upper bits of the register aren't garbage.

Why not have sign-extending variants of the 'ref' operators?
     Because that would double the number of 'ref' operators, and we
     need the 'ext' bytecode anyway for accessing bitfields.

Why not have constant-address variants of the 'ref' operators?
     Because that would double the number of 'ref' operators again, and
     'const32 ADDRESS ref32' is only one byte longer.

Why do the 'refN' operators have to support unaligned fetches?
     GDB will generate bytecode that fetches multi-byte values at
     unaligned addresses whenever the executable's debugging information
     tells it to.  Furthermore, GDB does not know the value the pointer
     will have when GDB generates the bytecode, so it cannot determine
     whether a particular fetch will be aligned or not.

     In particular, structure bitfields may be several bytes long, but
     follow no alignment rules; members of packed structures are not
     necessarily aligned either.

     In general, there are many cases where unaligned references occur
     in correct C code, either at the programmer's explicit request, or
     at the compiler's discretion.  Thus, it is simpler to make the GDB
     agent bytecodes work correctly in all circumstances than to make
     GDB guess in each case whether the compiler did the usual thing.

Why are there no side-effecting operators?
     Because our current client doesn't want them?  That's a cheap
     answer.  I think the real answer is that I'm afraid of implementing
     function calls.  We should re-visit this issue after the present
     contract is delivered.

Why aren't the 'goto' ops PC-relative?
     The interpreter has the base address around anyway for PC bounds
     checking, and it seemed simpler.

Why is there only one offset size for the 'goto' ops?
     Offsets are currently sixteen bits.  I'm not happy with this
     situation either:

     Suppose we have multiple branch ops with different offset sizes.
     As I generate code left-to-right, all my jumps are forward jumps
     (there are no loops in expressions), so I never know the target
     when I emit the jump opcode.  Thus, I have to either always assume
     the largest offset size, or do jump relaxation on the code after I
     generate it, which seems like a big waste of time.

     I can imagine a reasonable expression being longer than 256 bytes.
     I can't imagine one being longer than 64k.  Thus, we need 16-bit
     offsets.  This kind of reasoning is so bogus, but relaxation is
     pathetic.

     The other approach would be to generate code right-to-left.  Then
     I'd always know my offset size.  That might be fun.

Where is the function call bytecode?

     When we add side-effects, we should add this.

Why does the 'reg' bytecode take a 16-bit register number?

     Intel's IA-64 architecture has 128 general-purpose registers, and
     128 floating-point registers, and I'm sure it has some random
     control registers.

Why do we need 'trace' and 'trace_quick'?
     Because GDB needs to record all the memory contents and registers
     an expression touches.  If the user wants to evaluate an expression
     'x->y->z', the agent must record the values of 'x' and 'x->y' as
     well as the value of 'x->y->z'.

Don't the 'trace' bytecodes make the interpreter less general?
     They do mean that the interpreter contains special-purpose code,
     but that doesn't mean the interpreter can only be used for that
     purpose.  If an expression doesn't use the 'trace' bytecodes, they
     don't get in its way.

Why doesn't 'trace_quick' consume its arguments the way everything else does?
     In general, you do want your operators to consume their arguments;
     it's consistent, and generally reduces the amount of stack
     rearrangement necessary.  However, 'trace_quick' is a kludge to
     save space; it only exists so we needn't write 'dup const8 SIZE
     trace' before every memory reference.  Therefore, it's okay for it
     not to consume its arguments; it's meant for a specific context in
     which we know exactly what it should do with the stack.  If we're
     going to have a kludge, it should be an effective kludge.

Why does 'trace16' exist?
     That opcode was added by the customer that contracted Cygnus for
     the data tracing work.  I personally think it is unnecessary;
     objects that large will be quite rare, so it is okay to use 'dup
     const16 SIZE trace' in those cases.

     Whatever we decide to do with 'trace16', we should at least leave
     opcode 0x30 reserved, to remain compatible with the customer who
     added it.

Appendix G Target Descriptions
******************************

One of the challenges of using GDB to debug embedded systems is that
there are so many minor variants of each processor architecture in use.
It is common practice for vendors to start with a standard processor
core -- ARM, PowerPC, or MIPS, for example -- and then make changes to
adapt it to a particular market niche.  Some architectures have hundreds
of variants, available from dozens of vendors.  This leads to a number
of problems:

   * With so many different customized processors, it is difficult for
     the GDB maintainers to keep up with the changes.
   * Since individual variants may have short lifetimes or limited
     audiences, it may not be worthwhile to carry information about
     every variant in the GDB source tree.
   * When GDB does support the architecture of the embedded system at
     hand, the task of finding the correct architecture name to give the
     'set architecture' command can be error-prone.

   To address these problems, the GDB remote protocol allows a target
system to not only identify itself to GDB, but to actually describe its
own features.  This lets GDB support processor variants it has never
seen before -- to the extent that the descriptions are accurate, and
that GDB understands them.

   GDB must be linked with the Expat library to support XML target
descriptions.  *Note Expat::.

* Menu:

* Retrieving Descriptions::         How descriptions are fetched from a target.
* Target Description Format::       The contents of a target description.
* Predefined Target Types::         Standard types available for target
                                    descriptions.

G.1 Retrieving Descriptions
===========================

Target descriptions can be read from the target automatically, or
specified by the user manually.  The default behavior is to read the
description from the target.  GDB retrieves it via the remote protocol
using 'qXfer' requests (*note qXfer: General Query Packets.).  The ANNEX
in the 'qXfer' packet will be 'target.xml'.  The contents of the
'target.xml' annex are an XML document, of the form described in *note
Target Description Format::.

   Alternatively, you can specify a file to read for the target
description.  If a file is set, the target will not be queried.  The
commands to specify a file are:

'set tdesc filename PATH'
     Read the target description from PATH.

'unset tdesc filename'
     Do not read the XML target description from a file.  GDB will use
     the description supplied by the current target.

'show tdesc filename'
     Show the filename to read for a target description, if any.

G.2 Target Description Format
=============================

A target description annex is an XML (http://www.w3.org/XML/) document
which complies with the Document Type Definition provided in the GDB
sources in 'gdb/features/gdb-target.dtd'.  This means you can use
generally available tools like 'xmllint' to check that your feature
descriptions are well-formed and valid.  However, to help people
unfamiliar with XML write descriptions for their targets, we also
describe the grammar here.

   Target descriptions can identify the architecture of the remote
target and (for some architectures) provide information about custom
register sets.  They can also identify the OS ABI of the remote target.
GDB can use this information to autoconfigure for your target, or to
warn you if you connect to an unsupported target.

   Here is a simple target description:

     <target version="1.0">
       <architecture>i386:x86-64</architecture>
     </target>

This minimal description only says that the target uses the x86-64
architecture.

   A target description has the following overall form, with [ ] marking
optional elements and ... marking repeatable elements.  The elements are
explained further below.

     <?xml version="1.0"?>
     <!DOCTYPE target SYSTEM "gdb-target.dtd">
     <target version="1.0">
       [ARCHITECTURE]
       [OSABI]
       [COMPATIBLE]
       [FEATURE...]
     </target>

The description is generally insensitive to whitespace and line breaks,
under the usual common-sense rules.  The XML version declaration and
document type declaration can generally be omitted (GDB does not require
them), but specifying them may be useful for XML validation tools.  The
'version' attribute for '<target>' may also be omitted, but we recommend
including it; if future versions of GDB use an incompatible revision of
'gdb-target.dtd', they will detect and report the version mismatch.

G.2.1 Inclusion
---------------

It can sometimes be valuable to split a target description up into
several different annexes, either for organizational purposes, or to
share files between different possible target descriptions.  You can
divide a description into multiple files by replacing any element of the
target description with an inclusion directive of the form:

     <xi:include href="DOCUMENT"/>

When GDB encounters an element of this form, it will retrieve the named
XML DOCUMENT, and replace the inclusion directive with the contents of
that document.  If the current description was read using 'qXfer', then
so will be the included document; DOCUMENT will be interpreted as the
name of an annex.  If the current description was read from a file, GDB
will look for DOCUMENT as a file in the same directory where it found
the original description.

G.2.2 Architecture
------------------

An '<architecture>' element has this form:

       <architecture>ARCH</architecture>

   ARCH is one of the architectures from the set accepted by 'set
architecture' (*note Specifying a Debugging Target: Targets.).

G.2.3 OS ABI
------------

This optional field was introduced in GDB version 7.0.  Previous
versions of GDB ignore it.

   An '<osabi>' element has this form:

       <osabi>ABI-NAME</osabi>

   ABI-NAME is an OS ABI name from the same selection accepted by
'set osabi' (*note Configuring the Current ABI: ABI.).

G.2.4 Compatible Architecture
-----------------------------

This optional field was introduced in GDB version 7.0.  Previous
versions of GDB ignore it.

   A '<compatible>' element has this form:

       <compatible>ARCH</compatible>

   ARCH is one of the architectures from the set accepted by 'set
architecture' (*note Specifying a Debugging Target: Targets.).

   A '<compatible>' element is used to specify that the target is able
to run binaries in some other than the main target architecture given by
the '<architecture>' element.  For example, on the Cell Broadband
Engine, the main architecture is 'powerpc:common' or 'powerpc:common64',
but the system is able to run binaries in the 'spu' architecture as
well.  The way to describe this capability with '<compatible>' is as
follows:

       <architecture>powerpc:common</architecture>
       <compatible>spu</compatible>

G.2.5 Features
--------------

Each '<feature>' describes some logical portion of the target system.
Features are currently used to describe available CPU registers and the
types of their contents.  A '<feature>' element has this form:

     <feature name="NAME">
       [TYPE...]
       REG...
     </feature>

Each feature's name should be unique within the description.  The name
of a feature does not matter unless GDB has some special knowledge of
the contents of that feature; if it does, the feature should have its
standard name.  *Note Standard Target Features::.

G.2.6 Types
-----------

Any register's value is a collection of bits which GDB must interpret.
The default interpretation is a two's complement integer, but other
types can be requested by name in the register description.  Some
predefined types are provided by GDB (*note Predefined Target Types::),
and the description can define additional composite and enum types.

   Each type element must have an 'id' attribute, which gives a unique
(within the containing '<feature>') name to the type.  Types must be
defined before they are used.

   Some targets offer vector registers, which can be treated as arrays
of scalar elements.  These types are written as '<vector>' elements,
specifying the array element type, TYPE, and the number of elements,
COUNT:

     <vector id="ID" type="TYPE" count="COUNT"/>

   If a register's value is usefully viewed in multiple ways, define it
with a union type containing the useful representations.  The '<union>'
element contains one or more '<field>' elements, each of which has a
NAME and a TYPE:

     <union id="ID">
       <field name="NAME" type="TYPE"/>
       ...
     </union>

   If a register's value is composed from several separate values,
define it with either a structure type or a flags type.  A flags type
may only contain bitfields.  A structure type may either contain only
bitfields or contain no bitfields.  If the value contains only
bitfields, its total size in bytes must be specified.

   Non-bitfield values have a NAME and TYPE.

     <struct id="ID">
       <field name="NAME" type="TYPE"/>
       ...
     </struct>

   Both NAME and TYPE values are required.  No implicit padding is
added.

   Bitfield values have a NAME, START, END and TYPE.

     <struct id="ID" size="SIZE">
       <field name="NAME" start="START" end="END" type="TYPE"/>
       ...
     </struct>

     <flags id="ID" size="SIZE">
       <field name="NAME" start="START" end="END" type="TYPE"/>
       ...
     </flags>

   The NAME value is required.  Bitfield values may be named with the
empty string, '""', in which case the field is "filler" and its value is
not printed.  Not all bits need to be specified, so "filler" fields are
optional.

   The START and END values are required, and TYPE is optional.  The
field's START must be less than or equal to its END, and zero represents
the least significant bit.

   The default value of TYPE is 'bool' for single bit fields, and an
unsigned integer otherwise.

   Which to choose?  Structures or flags?

   Registers defined with 'flags' have these advantages over defining
them with 'struct':

   * Arithmetic may be performed on them as if they were integers.
   * They are printed in a more readable fashion.

   Registers defined with 'struct' have one advantage over defining them
with 'flags':

   * One can fetch individual fields like in 'C'.

          (gdb) print $my_struct_reg.field3
          $1 = 42

G.2.7 Registers
---------------

Each register is represented as an element with this form:

     <reg name="NAME"
          bitsize="SIZE"
          [regnum="NUM"]
          [save-restore="SAVE-RESTORE"]
          [type="TYPE"]
          [group="GROUP"]/>

The components are as follows:

NAME
     The register's name; it must be unique within the target
     description.

BITSIZE
     The register's size, in bits.

REGNUM
     The register's number.  If omitted, a register's number is one
     greater than that of the previous register (either in the current
     feature or in a preceding feature); the first register in the
     target description defaults to zero.  This register number is used
     to read or write the register; e.g. it is used in the remote 'p'
     and 'P' packets, and registers appear in the 'g' and 'G' packets in
     order of increasing register number.

SAVE-RESTORE
     Whether the register should be preserved across inferior function
     calls; this must be either 'yes' or 'no'.  The default is 'yes',
     which is appropriate for most registers except for some system
     control registers; this is not related to the target's ABI.

TYPE
     The type of the register.  It may be a predefined type, a type
     defined in the current feature, or one of the special types 'int'
     and 'float'.  'int' is an integer type of the correct size for
     BITSIZE, and 'float' is a floating point type (in the
     architecture's normal floating point format) of the correct size
     for BITSIZE.  The default is 'int'.

GROUP
     The register group to which this register belongs.  It must be
     either 'general', 'float', or 'vector'.  If no GROUP is specified,
     GDB will not display the register in 'info registers'.

G.3 Predefined Target Types
===========================

Type definitions in the self-description can build up composite types
from basic building blocks, but can not define fundamental types.
Instead, standard identifiers are provided by GDB for the fundamental
types.  The currently supported types are:

'bool'
     Boolean type, occupying a single bit.

'int8'
'int16'
'int32'
'int64'
'int128'
     Signed integer types holding the specified number of bits.

'uint8'
'uint16'
'uint32'
'uint64'
'uint128'
     Unsigned integer types holding the specified number of bits.

'code_ptr'
'data_ptr'
     Pointers to unspecified code and data.  The program counter and any
     dedicated return address register may be marked as code pointers;
     printing a code pointer converts it into a symbolic address.  The
     stack pointer and any dedicated address registers may be marked as
     data pointers.

'ieee_single'
     Single precision IEEE floating point.

'ieee_double'
     Double precision IEEE floating point.

'arm_fpa_ext'
     The 12-byte extended precision format used by ARM FPA registers.

'i387_ext'
     The 10-byte extended precision format used by x87 registers.

'i386_eflags'
     32bit EFLAGS register used by x86.

'i386_mxcsr'
     32bit MXCSR register used by x86.
