   - How many unique completions have been generated, to terminate

     so large as to be useless.  This helps avoid GDB seeming to lock
     up in the event the user requests to complete on something vague
     that necessitates the time consuming expansion of many symbol
     tables.

   - The completer's idea of least common denominator (aka the common
     prefix) between all completion matches to hand over to readline.
     Some completers provide matches that don't start with the
     completion "word".  E.g., completing on "b push_ba" on a C++
     program usually completes to std::vector<...>::push_back,
     std::string::push_back etc.  If all matches happen to start with
     "std::", then readline would figure out that the lowest common
     denominator is "std::", and thus would do a partial completion
     with that.  I.e., it would replace "push_ba" in the input buffer
     with "std::", losing the original "push_ba", which is obviously
     undesirable.  To avoid that, such completers pass the substring
     of the match that matters for common denominator computation as
     MATCH_FOR_LCD argument to add_completion.  The end result is
     passed to readline in gdb_rl_attempted_completion_function.

   - The custom word point to hand over to readline, for completers
     that parse the input string in order to dynamically adjust
     themselves depending on exactly what they're completing.  E.g.,
     the linespec completer needs to bypass readline's too-simple word
     breaking algorithm.
