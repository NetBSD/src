/* Add a using directive to USING_DIRECTIVES.  If the using directive
   in question has already been added, don't add it twice.

   Create a new struct using_direct which imports the namespace SRC
   into the scope DEST.  ALIAS is the name of the imported namespace
   in the current scope.  If ALIAS is NULL then the namespace is known
   by its original name.  DECLARATION is the name if the imported
   variable if this is a declaration import (Eg. using A::x), otherwise
   it is NULL.  EXCLUDES is a list of names not to import from an
   imported module or NULL.  If COPY_NAMES is non-zero, then the
   arguments are copied into newly allocated memory so they can be
   temporaries.  For EXCLUDES the contents of the vector are copied,
   but the pointed to characters are not copied.  */
