   Unfortunately, on certain older platforms, the debug info doesn't
   indicate reliably how each function was defined.  A function type's
   TYPE_PROTOTYPED flag may be clear, even if the function was defined
   in prototype style.  When calling a function whose TYPE_PROTOTYPED
   flag is clear, GDB consults this flag to decide what to do.

   For modern targets, it is proper to assume that, if the prototype
   flag is clear, that can be trusted: `float' arguments should be
   promoted to `double'.  For some older targets, if the prototype
   flag is clear, that doesn't tell us anything.  The default is to
