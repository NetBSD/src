/* An index into a (C++) symbol name component in a symbol name as
   recorded in the mapped_index's symbol table.  For each C++ symbol
   in the symbol table, we record one entry for the start of each
   component in the symbol in a table of name components, and then
   sort the table, in order to be able to binary search symbol names,
   ignoring leading namespaces, both completion and regular look up.
   For example, for symbol "A::B::C", we'll have an entry that points
   to "A::B::C", another that points to "B::C", and another for "C".
   Note that function symbols in GDB index have no parameter
   information, just the function/method names.  You can convert a
   name_component to a "const char *" using the
   'mapped_index::symbol_name_at(offset_type)' method.  */
