     This is only relevant in the context of pre-DWARF 5 split units.  In this
     context, there is a .debug_ranges section in the linked executable,
     containing all the ranges data for all the compilation units.  Each
     skeleton/stub unit has (if needed) a DW_AT_GNU_ranges_base attribute that
     indicates the base of its contribution to that section.  The DW_AT_ranges
     attributes in the split-unit are of the form DW_FORM_sec_offset and point
     into the .debug_ranges section of the linked file.  However, they are not
     "true" DW_FORM_sec_offset, because they are relative to the base of their
     compilation unit's contribution, rather than relative to the beginning of
     the section.  The DW_AT_GNU_ranges_base value must be added to it to make
     it relative to the beginning of the section.

     Note that the value is zero when we are not in a pre-DWARF 5 split-unit
     case, so this value can be added without needing to know whether we are in
     this case or not.

     N.B. If a DW_AT_ranges attribute is found on the DW_TAG_compile_unit in the
     skeleton/stub, it must not have the base added, as it already points to the
     right place.  And since the DW_TAG_compile_unit DIE in the split-unit can't
     have a DW_AT_ranges attribute, we can use the
