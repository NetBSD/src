/* If the program uses ELF-style shared libraries, then calls to
   functions in shared libraries go through stubs, which live in a
   table called the PLT (Procedure Linkage Table).  The first time the
   function is called, the stub sends control to the dynamic linker,
   which looks up the function's real address, patches the stub so
   that future calls will go directly to the function, and then passes
   control to the function.

   If we are stepping at the source level, we don't want to see any of
   this --- we just want to skip over the stub and the dynamic linker.
   The simple approach is to single-step until control leaves the
   dynamic linker.

   However, on some systems (e.g., Red Hat's 5.2 distribution) the
   dynamic linker calls functions in the shared C library, so you
   can't tell from the PC alone whether the dynamic linker is still
   running.  In this case, we use a step-resume breakpoint to get us
   past the dynamic linker, as if we were using "next" to step over a
   function call.

   in_solib_dynsym_resolve_code() says whether we're in the dynamic
   linker code or not.  Normally, this means we single-step.  However,
   if SKIP_SOLIB_RESOLVER then returns non-zero, then its value is an
   address where we can place a step-resume breakpoint to get past the
   linker's symbol resolution function.

   in_solib_dynsym_resolve_code() can generally be implemented in a
   pretty portable way, by comparing the PC against the address ranges
   of the dynamic linker's sections.

   SKIP_SOLIB_RESOLVER is generally going to be system-specific, since
   it depends on internal details of the dynamic linker.  It's usually
   not too hard to figure out where to put a breakpoint, but it
   certainly isn't portable.  SKIP_SOLIB_RESOLVER should do plenty of
   sanity checking.  If it can't figure things out, returning zero and
   getting the (possibly confusing) stepping behavior is better than
   signalling an error, which will obscure the change in the
   inferior's state.  */

/* This function returns TRUE if pc is the address of an instruction
   that lies within the dynamic linker (such as the event hook, or the
   dld itself).

   This function must be used only when a dynamic linker event has
   been caught, and the inferior is being stepped out of the hook, or
   undefined results are guaranteed.  */

/* In non-stop debugging mode, we must take special care to manage
   breakpoints properly; in particular, the traditional strategy for
   stepping a thread past a breakpoint it has hit is unsuitable.
   'Displaced stepping' is a tactic for stepping one thread past a
   breakpoint it has hit while ensuring that other threads running
   concurrently will hit the breakpoint as they should.

   The traditional way to step a thread T off a breakpoint in a
   multi-threaded program in all-stop mode is as follows:

   a0) Initially, all threads are stopped, and breakpoints are not
       inserted.
   a1) We single-step T, leaving breakpoints uninserted.
   a2) We insert breakpoints, and resume all threads.

   In non-stop debugging, however, this strategy is unsuitable: we
   don't want to have to stop all threads in the system in order to
   continue or step T past a breakpoint.  Instead, we use displaced
   stepping:

   n0) Initially, T is stopped, other threads are running, and
       breakpoints are inserted.
   n1) We copy the instruction "under" the breakpoint to a separate
       location, outside the main code stream, making any adjustments
       to the instruction, register, and memory state as directed by
       T's architecture.
   n2) We single-step T over the instruction at its new location.
   n3) We adjust the resulting register and memory state as directed
       by T's architecture.  This includes resetting T's PC to point
       back into the main instruction stream.
   n4) We resume T.

   This approach depends on the following gdbarch methods:

   - gdbarch_max_insn_length and gdbarch_displaced_step_location
     indicate where to copy the instruction, and how much space must
     be reserved there.  We use these in step n1.

   - gdbarch_displaced_step_copy_insn copies a instruction to a new
     address, and makes any necessary adjustments to the instruction,
     register contents, and memory.  We use this in step n1.

   - gdbarch_displaced_step_fixup adjusts registers and memory after
     we have successfuly single-stepped the instruction, to yield the
     same effect the instruction would have had if we had executed it
     at its original address.  We use this in step n3.

   - gdbarch_displaced_step_free_closure provides cleanup.

   The gdbarch_displaced_step_copy_insn and
   gdbarch_displaced_step_fixup functions must be written so that
   copying an instruction with gdbarch_displaced_step_copy_insn,
   single-stepping across the copied instruction, and then applying
   gdbarch_displaced_insn_fixup should have the same effects on the
   thread's memory and registers as stepping the instruction in place
   would have.  Exactly which responsibilities fall to the copy and
   which fall to the fixup is up to the author of those functions.

   See the comments in gdbarch.sh for details.

   Note that displaced stepping and software single-step cannot
   currently be used in combination, although with some care I think
   they could be made to.  Software single-step works by placing
   breakpoints on all possible subsequent instructions; if the
   displaced instruction is a PC-relative jump, those breakpoints
   could fall in very strange places --- on pages that aren't
   executable, or at addresses that are not proper instruction
   boundaries.  (We do generally let other threads run while we wait
   to hit the software single-step breakpoint, and they might
   encounter such a corrupted instruction.)  One way to work around
   this would be to have gdbarch_displaced_step_copy_insn fully
   simulate the effect of PC-relative instructions (and return NULL)
   on architectures that use software single-stepping.

   In non-stop mode, we can have independent and simultaneous step
   requests, so more than one thread may need to simultaneously step
   over a breakpoint.  The current implementation assumes there is
   only one scratch space per process.  In this case, we have to
   serialize access to the scratch space.  If thread A wants to step
   over a breakpoint, but we are currently waiting for some other
   thread to complete a displaced step, we leave thread A stopped and
   place it in the displaced_step_request_queue.  Whenever a displaced
   step finishes, we pick the next thread in the queue and start a new
   displaced step operation on it.  See displaced_step_prepare and
   displaced_step_fixup for details.  */

     For now, this difference in behavior is accepted since there is no

     behavior means that even if there is a *breakpoint* in the signal
     handler, GDB still would not stop.

     Fortunately, we can at least fix this particular issue.  We detect
     here the case where we are about to deliver a signal while software
     single-stepping with breakpoints removed.  In this situation, we
     revert the decisions to remove all breakpoints and insert single-
     step breakpoints, and instead we install a step-resume breakpoint

     value was not set properly for subsequent commands.  The prev_pc value 
     is used to initialize the starting line number in the ecs.  With an

     extraneous line table entries that do not increase the line number.
     When we issue the gdb next command on the ia64 after an inferior call

     clear where the PC is pointing afterwards.  It may not match
     gdbarch_decr_pc_after_break.  I don't know any specific target that
     generates these signals at breakpoints (the code has been in GDB since at
     least 1992) so I can not guess how to handle them here.

     In earlier versions of GDB, a target with 
     gdbarch_have_nonsteppable_watchpoint would have the PC after hitting a
     watchpoint affected by gdbarch_decr_pc_after_break.  I haven't found any
     target with both of these set in GDB history, and it seems unlikely to be

     architecture:

       B1         0x08000000 :   INSN1
       B2         0x08000001 :   INSN2

     Say you're stopped at 0x08000003 as above.  Reverse continuing
     from that point should hit B2 as below.  Reading the PC when the
     SIGTRAP is reported should read 0x08000001 and INSN2 should have
     been de-executed already.

       B1         0x08000000 :   INSN1

		  0x08000002 :   INSN3
		  0x08000003 :   INSN4

     We can't apply the same logic as for forward execution, because
     we would wrongly adjust the PC to 0x08000000, since there's a
