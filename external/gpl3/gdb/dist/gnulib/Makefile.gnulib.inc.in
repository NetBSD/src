# A makefile snippet that lists all of the libraries that should be
# pulled in when linking against gnulib.  Both GDB and GDBSERVER will
# include this snippet.
#
# The defined variables are:
#
# LIBGNU: The path to the archive containing gnulib.  Can be used as a
#        dependency as when this file changes gdb/gdbserver should be
#        relinked.
#
# LIBGNU_EXTRA_LIBS: A list of linker -l.... flags that should be
#        included in the link line of gdb/gdbserver.  These are
#        libraries that $(LIBGNU) depends on.  This list is taken from
#        the output of gnulib-tool, which is run by our
#        gnulib/update-gnulib.sh script.
#
# INCGNU: A list of -I.... include paths that should be passed to the
#        compiler, these are where the gnulib headers can be found.

# Packages must define the relative path to gnulib's parent dir.
