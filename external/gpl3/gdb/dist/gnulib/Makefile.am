# The toplevel makefile overrides $(CC) (in EXTRA_HOST_FLAGS) by setting
# it to whatever CC was in the toplevel configure.  This breaks in Gnulib with
# older GCCs, because Gnulib's configure uses this variable to store the
# standard-setting switch (e.g. -std=gnu99/-std=gnu11).  To fix this, we just
# set MAKEOVERRIDES to empty here so that import/ uses the right $(CC).
#
# This problem is visible with compilers that don't use C99 by default, such
# as GCC 4.8.5 (Centos 7).
