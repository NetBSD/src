/* A forward_scope_exit is like scope_exit, but instead of giving it a
   callable, you instead specialize it for a given cleanup function,
   and the generated class automatically has a constructor with the
   same interface as the cleanup function.  forward_scope_exit
   captures the arguments passed to the ctor, and in turn passes those
   as arguments to the wrapped cleanup function, when it is called at
   scope exit time, from within the forward_scope_exit dtor.  The
   forward_scope_exit class can take any number of arguments, and is
   cancelable if needed.

   This allows usage like this:

      void
      delete_longjmp_breakpoint (int arg)
      {
	// Blah, blah, blah...
      }

      using longjmp_breakpoint_cleanup
	= FORWARD_SCOPE_EXIT (delete_longjmp_breakpoint);

   This above created a new cleanup class `longjmp_breakpoint_cleanup`
   than can then be used like this:

      longjmp_breakpoint_cleanup obj (thread);

      // Blah, blah, blah...

      obj.release ();  // Optional cancel if needed.

   forward_scope_exit is also handy when you would need to wrap a
   scope_exit in a gdb::optional:

      gdb::optional<longjmp_breakpoint_cleanup> cleanup;
      if (some condition)
	cleanup.emplace (thread);
      ...
      if (cleanup)
	cleanup->release ();

   since with scope exit, you would have to know the scope_exit's
   callable template type when you create the gdb::optional:

     gdb:optional<scope_exit<what goes here?>>

   The "forward" naming fits both purposes shown above -- the class
   "forwards" ctor arguments to the wrapped cleanup function at scope
   exit time, and can also be used to "forward declare"
   scope_exit-like objects.  */
