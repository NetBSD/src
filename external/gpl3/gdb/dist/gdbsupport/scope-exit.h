/* scope_exit is a general-purpose scope guard that calls its exit
   function at the end of the current scope.  A scope_exit may be
   canceled by calling the "release" method.  The API is modeled on
   P0052R5 - Generic Scope Guard and RAII Wrapper for the Standard
   Library, which is itself based on Andrej Alexandrescu's
   ScopeGuard/SCOPE_EXIT.

   There are two forms available:

   - The "make_scope_exit" form allows canceling the scope guard.  Use
     it like this:

     auto cleanup = make_scope_exit ( <function, function object, lambda> );
     ...
     cleanup.release (); // cancel

   - If you don't need to cancel the guard, you can use the SCOPE_EXIT
     macro, like this:

     SCOPE_EXIT
       {
	 // any code you like here.
       }

   See also forward_scope_exit.
