/* The ptid struct is a collection of the various "ids" necessary for
   identifying the inferior process/thread being debugged.  This
   consists of the process id (pid), lightweight process id (lwp) and
   thread id (tid).  When manipulating ptids, the constructors,
   accessors, and predicates declared in this file should be used.  Do
   NOT access the struct ptid members directly.

   process_stratum targets that handle threading themselves should
   prefer using the ptid.lwp field, leaving the ptid.tid field for any
   thread_stratum target that might want to sit on top.
