/* RAII class used to ignore a signal in a scope.  If sigprocmask is
   supported, then the signal is only ignored by the calling thread.
   Otherwise, the signal disposition is set to SIG_IGN, which affects
   the whole process.  If ConsumePending is true, the destructor
   consumes a pending Sig.  SIGPIPE for example is queued on the
   thread even if blocked at the time the pipe is written to.  SIGTTOU
   OTOH is not raised at all if the thread writing to the terminal has
   it blocked.  Because SIGTTOU is sent to the whole process instead
   of to a specific thread, consuming a pending SIGTTOU in the
   destructor could consume a signal raised due to actions done by
   some other thread.  */
