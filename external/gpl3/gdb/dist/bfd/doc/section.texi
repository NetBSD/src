@section Sections
The raw data contained within a BFD is maintained through the
section abstraction.  A single BFD may have any number of
sections.  It keeps hold of them by pointing to the first;
each one points to the next in the list.

Sections are supported in BFD in @code{section.c}.

@node Section Input, Section Output, Sections, Sections
@subsection Section input
When a BFD is opened for reading, the section structures are
created and attached to the BFD.

Each section has a name which describes the section in the
outside world---for example, @code{a.out} would contain at least
three sections, called @code{.text}, @code{.data} and @code{.bss}.

Names need not be unique; for example a COFF file may have several
sections named @code{.data}.

Sometimes a BFD will contain more than the ``natural'' number of
sections. A back end may attach other sections containing
constructor data, or an application may add a section (using
@code{bfd_make_section}) to the sections attached to an already open
BFD. For example, the linker creates an extra section
@code{COMMON} for each input file's BFD to hold information about
common storage.

The raw data is not necessarily read in when
the section descriptor is created. Some targets may leave the
data in place until a @code{bfd_get_section_contents} call is
made. Other back ends may read in all the data at once.  For
example, an S-record file has to be read once to determine the
size of the data.

@node Section Output, typedef asection, Section Input, Sections
@subsection Section output
To write a new object style BFD, the various sections to be
written have to be created. They are attached to the BFD in
the same way as input sections; data is written to the
sections using @code{bfd_set_section_contents}.

Any program that creates or combines sections (e.g., the assembler
and linker) must use the @code{asection} fields @code{output_section} and
@code{output_offset} to indicate the file sections to which each
section must be written.  (If the section is being created from
scratch, @code{output_section} should probably point to the section
itself and @code{output_offset} should probably be zero.)

The data to be written comes from input sections attached
(via @code{output_section} pointers) to
the output sections.  The output section structure can be
considered a filter for the input section: the output section
determines the vma of the output data and the name, but the
input section determines the offset into the output section of
the data to be written.

E.g., to create a section "O", starting at 0x100, 0x123 long,
containing two subsections, "A" at offset 0x0 (i.e., at vma
0x100) and "B" at offset 0x20 (i.e., at vma 0x120) the @code{asection}
structures would look like:

@example
   section name          "A"
     output_offset   0x00
     size            0x20
     output_section ----------->  section name    "O"
                             |    vma             0x100
   section name          "B" |    size            0x123
     output_offset   0x20    |
     size            0x103   |
     output_section  --------|
@end example

@subsection Link orders
The data within a section is stored in a @dfn{link_order}.
These are much like the fixups in @code{gas}.  The link_order
abstraction allows a section to grow and shrink within itself.

A link_order knows how big it is, and which is the next
link_order and where the raw data for it is; it also points to
a list of relocations which apply to it.

The link_order is used by the linker to perform relaxing on
final code.  The compiler creates code which is as big as
necessary to make it work without relaxing, and the user can
select whether to relax.  Sometimes relaxing takes a lot of
time.  The linker runs around the relocations to see if any
are attached to data which can be shrunk, if so it does it on
a link_order by link_order basis.

return the next most recently created section attached to the same
BFD with the same name, or if no such section exists in the same BFD and
IBFD is non-NULL, the next section with the same name in any input
BFD following IBFD.  Return NULL on finding no section.

@findex bfd_get_linker_section

and attach it to the end of the chain of sections for the
BFD @var{abfd}. An attempt to create a section with a name which
is already in use returns its pointer without changing the
section chain.

It has the funny name since this is the way it used to be
before it was rewritten....

Possible errors are:
@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{bfd_error_invalid_operation} -
If output has already started for this BFD.

    void *obj);
@end example
@strong{Description}@*
Call the provided function @var{func} for each section
attached to the BFD @var{abfd}, passing @var{obj} as an
argument. The function will be called as if by

@example
       func (abfd, the_section, obj);
@end example

This is the preferred method for iterating over sections; an
alternative would be to use a loop:

@example
          asection *p;
          for (p = abfd->sections; p != NULL; p = p->next)
             func (abfd, p, ...)

    void *obj);
@end example
@strong{Description}@*
Call the provided function @var{operation} for each section
attached to the BFD @var{abfd}, passing @var{obj} as an
argument. The function will be called as if by

@example
       operation (abfd, the_section, obj);
@end example

It returns the first section for which @var{operation} returns true.

@findex bfd_set_section_size

ok, then @code{TRUE} is returned, else @code{FALSE}.

Possible error returns:
@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{bfd_error_invalid_operation} -
Writing has started to the BFD, so setting the size is invalid.
@end itemize

@findex bfd_set_section_contents
@subsubsection @code{bfd_set_section_contents}
@strong{Synopsis}
@example
bool bfd_set_section_contents
   (bfd *abfd, asection *section, const void *data,
    file_ptr offset, bfd_size_type count);
@end example
@strong{Description}@*
Sets the contents of the section @var{section} in BFD
@var{abfd} to the data starting in memory at @var{location}.
The data is written to the output section starting at offset
@var{offset} for @var{count} octets.

Normally @code{TRUE} is returned, but @code{FALSE} is returned if
there was an error.  Possible error returns are:
@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{bfd_error_no_contents} -
The output section does not have the @code{SEC_HAS_CONTENTS}
attribute, so nothing can be written to it.
@item
@code{bfd_error_bad_value} -
The section is unable to contain all of the data.
@item
@code{bfd_error_invalid_operation} -
The BFD is not writeable.
@item
and some more too.
@end itemize
This routine is front end to the back end function
@code{_bfd_set_section_contents}.

@strong{Synopsis}
@example
bool bfd_get_section_contents
   (bfd *abfd, asection *section, void *location, file_ptr offset,
    bfd_size_type count);
@end example
@strong{Description}@*
Read data from @var{section} in BFD @var{abfd}
into memory starting at @var{location}. The data is read at an
offset of @var{offset} from the start of the input section,
and is read for @var{count} bytes.

If the contents of a constructor with the @code{SEC_CONSTRUCTOR}
flag set are requested or if the section does not have the
@code{SEC_HAS_CONTENTS} flag set, then the @var{location} is filled
with zeroes. If no errors occur, @code{TRUE} is returned, else
@code{FALSE}.

@findex bfd_malloc_and_get_section
@subsubsection @code{bfd_malloc_and_get_section}
@strong{Synopsis}

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
Copy private section information from @var{isec} in the BFD
@var{ibfd} to the section @var{osec} in the BFD @var{obfd}.
Return @code{TRUE} on success, @code{FALSE} on error.  Possible error
returns are:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{bfd_error_no_memory} -
Not enough memory exists to create private data for @var{osec}.
