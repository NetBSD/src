   compatible, then this function should return architecture that is more
   "feature-rich", that is, can run both A and B.  ARCv2, EM and HS all has
   same mach number, so bfd_default_compatible assumes they are the same, and
   returns an A.  That causes issues with GDB, because GDB assumes that if
   machines are compatible, then "compatible ()" always returns same machine
   regardless of argument order.  As a result GDB gets confused because, for
   example, compatible (ARCv2, EM) returns ARCv2, but compatible (EM, ARCv2)
   returns EM, hence GDB is not sure if they are compatible and prints a
   warning.  */
