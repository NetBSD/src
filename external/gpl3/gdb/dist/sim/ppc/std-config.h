/* Callback/Default Memory.

   Core includes a builtin memory type (raw_memory) that is
   implemented using an array.  raw_memory does not require any
   additional functions etc.

   Callback memory is where the core calls a core device for the data
   it requires.

   Default memory is an extenstion of this where for addresses that do
   not map into either a callback or core memory range a default map
   can be used.

   The OEA model uses callback memory for devices and default memory
   for buses.

   The VEA model uses callback memory to capture `page faults'.

   While it may be possible to eliminate callback/default memory (and
   hence also eliminate an additional test per memory fetch) it
   probably is not worth the effort.

   BTW, while raw_memory could have been implemented as a callback,
   profiling has shown that there is a biger win (at least for the
   x86) in eliminating a function call for the most common
   (raw_memory) case. */

/* INLINE CODE SELECTION:

   GCC -O3 attempts to inline any function or procedure in scope.  The
   options below facilitate fine grained control over what is and what
   isn't made inline.  For instance it can control things down to a
   specific modules static routines.  Doing this allows the compiler
   to both eliminate the overhead of function calls and (as a
   consequence) also eliminate further dead code.

   On a CISC (x86) I've found that I can achieve an order of magnitude
   speed improvement (x3-x5).  In the case of RISC (sparc) while the
   performance gain isn't as great it is still significant.

   Each module is controled by the macro <module>_INLINE which can
   have the values described below

       0  Do not inline any thing for the given module

   The following additional values are `bit fields' and can be
   combined.

      REVEAL_MODULE:

         Include the C file for the module into the file being compiled
         but do not make the functions within the module inline.

	 While of no apparent benefit, this makes it possible for the
	 included module, when compiled to inline its calls to what
	 would otherwize be external functions.

      INLINE_MODULE:

         Make external functions within the module `inline'.  Thus if
         the module is included into a file being compiled, calls to
	 its funtions can be eliminated. 2 implies 1.

      INLINE_LOCALS:

         Make internal (static) functions within the module `inline'.

   The following abreviations are available:

      INCLUDE_MODULE == (REVEAL_MODULE | INLINE_MODULE)

      ALL_C_INLINE == (REVEAL_MODULE | INLINE_MODULE | INLINE_LOCALS)

   In addition to this, modules have been put into two categories.

         Simple modules - eg sim-endian.h bits.h

	 Because these modules are small and simple and do not have
	 any complex interpendencies they are configured, if
	 <module>_INLINE is so enabled, to inline themselves in all
	 modules that include those files.

	 For the default build, this is a real win as all byte
	 conversion and bit manipulation functions are inlined.

	 Complex modules - the rest

	 These are all handled using the files inline.h and inline.c.
	 psim.c includes the above which in turn include any remaining
	 code.

   IMPLEMENTATION:

   The inline ability is enabled by prefixing every data / function
   declaration and definition with one of the following:


       INLINE_<module>

       Prefix to any global function that is a candidate for being
       inline.

       values - `', `static', `static INLINE'


       EXTERN_<module>
      
       Prefix to any global data structures for the module.  Global
       functions that are not to be inlined shall also be prefixed
       with this.

       values - `', `static', `static'


       STATIC_INLINE_<module>

       Prefix to any local (static) function that is a candidate for
       being made inline.

       values - `static', `static INLINE'


       static

       Prefix all local data structures.  Local functions that are not
       to be inlined shall also be prefixed with this.

       values - `static', `static'

       nb: will not work for modules that are being inlined for every
       use (white lie).


       extern
       #ifndef _INLINE_C_
       #endif
       
       Prefix to any declaration of a global object (function or
       variable) that should not be inlined and should have only one
       definition.  The #ifndef wrapper goes around the definition
       propper to ensure that only one copy is generated.

       nb: this will not work when a module is being inlined for every
       use.


       STATIC_<module>

       Replaced by either `static' or `EXTERN_MODULE'.


   REALITY CHECK:

   This is not for the faint hearted.  I've seen GCC get up to 500mb
   trying to compile what this can create.

   Some of the modules do not yet implement the WITH_INLINE_STATIC
   option.  Instead they use the macro STATIC_INLINE to control their
   local function.

   Because of the way that GCC parses __attribute__(), the macro's
   need to be adjacent to the function name rather than at the start
   of the line vis:

   	int STATIC_INLINE_MODULE f(void);
	void INLINE_MODULE *g(void);
