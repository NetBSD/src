dnl Additional SIM options that can (optionally) be configured
dnl For optional simulator options, a macro SIM_AC_OPTION_* is defined.
dnl Simulators that wish to use the relevant option specify the macro
dnl in the simulator specific configure.ac file between the SIM_AC_COMMON
dnl and SIM_AC_OUTPUT lines.
dnl
dnl Specify the running environment.
dnl If the simulator invokes this in its configure.ac then without this option
dnl the default is the user environment and all are runtime selectable.
dnl If the simulator doesn't invoke this, only the user environment is
dnl supported.
dnl ??? Until there is demonstrable value in doing something more complicated,
dnl let's not.
