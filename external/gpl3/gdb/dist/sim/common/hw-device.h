/* Introduction:

   As explained in earlier sections, the device, device instance,
   property and ports lie at the heart of PSIM's device model.

   In the below a synopsis of the device object and the operations it
   supports are given.
   */


/* Creation:

   The devices are created using a sequence of steps.  In particular:

	o	A tree framework is created.

		At this point, properties can be modified and extra
		devices inserted (or removed?).

#if LATER

		Any properties that have a run-time value (eg ihandle
		or device instance pointer properties) are entered
		into the device tree using a named reference to the
		corresponding runtime object that is to be created.

#endif

	o	Real devices are created for all the dummy devices.

		A device can assume that all of its parents have been
		initialized.

		A device can assume that all non run-time properties
		have been initialized.

		As part of being created, the device normally attaches
		itself to its parent bus.

#if LATER

		Device instance data is initialized.

#endif

#if LATER

	o	Any run-time properties are created.

#endif

#if MUCH_MUCH_LATER

	o	Some devices, as part of their initialization
		might want to refer to ihandle properties
		in the device tree.

#endif

   NOTES:

	o	It is important to separate the creation
		of an actual device from the creation
		of the tree.  The alternative creating
		the device in two stages: As a separate
		entity and then as a part of the tree.

#if LATER
	o	Run-time properties can not be created
		until after the devices in the tree
		have been created.  Hence an extra pass
		for handling them.
#endif

/* Hardware operations:

   Connecting a parent to its children is a common bus. The parent
   node is described as the bus owner and is responisble for
   co-ordinating bus operations. On the bus, a SPACE:ADDR pair is used
   to specify an address.  A device that is both a bus owner (parent)
   and bus client (child) are referred to as a bridging device.

   A child performing a data (DMA) transfer will pass its request to
   the bus owner (the devices parent).  The bus owner will then either
   reflect the request to one of the other devices attached to the bus
   (a child of the bus owner) or bridge the request up the tree to the
   next bus. */
