   If PROG_BFD is non-NULL, the file has already been opened.
   If VERBOSE_P is non-zero statistics are printed of each loaded section
   and the transfer rate (for consistency with gdb).
   If LMA_P is non-zero the program sections are loaded at the LMA
   rather than the VMA
   If this fails an error message is printed and NULL is returned.
   If it succeeds the bfd is returned.
   NOTE: For historical reasons, older hardware simulators incorrectly
   write the program sections at LMA interpreted as a virtual address.
   This is still accommodated for backward compatibility reasons. */
