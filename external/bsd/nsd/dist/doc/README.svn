If you build NSD directly from the Subversion repository, you will need the
(gnu) autotools to generate the configure script.

On most systems, this can simply be done by using autoreconf:

autoreconf -fi

This will call autoconf, autoheader, aclocal etc. After this you can build
normally with configure and make, see the general README for further
information on this.

Some systems do not have a symlink to separate versions, so you will have to
use the specific version name. It should work with at least 2.53 and 2.59.

The actual executable name may differ on various systems, most of the times
it is either called autoreconf-2.59 or autoreconf259


Some systems also do not have a standard aclocal link, in which case you
will have to tell autoreconf what aclocal executable to use. This can be
done by setting the ACLOCAL environment variable. It should work with
aclocal 1.4, 1.5 and 1.9.

Examples of complete commands:

ACLOCAL=aclocal19 autoreconf259

ACLOCAL=aclocal-1.9 autoreconf-2.59
