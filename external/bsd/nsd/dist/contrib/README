This is NSD contributions directory and it contains various additions
to NSD that are not a part of the official distribution but may be
helpful.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

* nsd.spec: a rpm specfile to generate binary and source rpms. 
  Put the source tarball in  /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES. Then 
  	rpmbuild -ba nsd.spec

* nsd.init: a shell script that can start, stop, restart the NSD daemon.
  It uses signals, and can be used in rc.d init scripts (depends on platform).

* nsd.zones2nsd.conf: a python script to convert NSD 2 nsd.zones config files
  to NSD 3 nsd.conf config files. Do not forget to set nsd_zones_name and
  key_dir variables at the top of the script. 

* bind2nsd: a slightly abridged form is included; find the full source
  at http://bind2nsd.sourceforge.net.  The bind2nsd scripts translate 
  DNS information in BIND format to NSD format, and then copy that 
  translation to an NSD server. The goal is to make it simple to run
  redundant BIND and NSD servers and keep them in sync, using only the
  BIND configuration files

* nsd_munin_ : plugin for munin statistics report
  You must have given --enable-bind8-stats (default is on) to configure.
  Copy the file to /usr/share/munin/plugins (or you munin node dir).
  You may also need to create a number of symbolic links under the names
  of the graphs you want to create (documented at head of file).

* nsd.socket and nsd.service : example systemd service scripts for NSD.
  They are copies from Unbound's service files, edited for NSD.
