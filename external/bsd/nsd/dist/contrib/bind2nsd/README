bind2nsd -- translate from BIND named.conf to NSD nsd.conf
         -- then, sync up configuration files with a Secure64 server


To install these tools on Linux systems:

   # ./install.sh

Then, copy bind2nsd.conf to the directory you will run these commands
from (e.g., /etc/named or /etc/bind9) and then edit the values properly.

Passwords for logging into a Secure64 system can be stored in the
bind2nsd.conf file (as clear text only) or can be stored encrypted
by using the 'password_file' config item and the s64-mkpw utility.
