//
// This file implements basic block placement transformations using the CFG
// structure and branch probability estimates.
//
// The pass strives to preserve the structure of the CFG (that is, retain
// a topological ordering of basic blocks) in the absence of a *strong* signal
// to the contrary from probabilities. However, within the CFG structure, it
// attempts to choose an ordering which favors placing more likely sequences of
// blocks adjacent to each other.
//
// The algorithm works from the inner-most loop within a function outward, and
// at each stage walks through the basic blocks, trying to coalesce them into
// sequential chains where allowed by the CFG (or demanded by heavy
// probabilities). Finally, it walks the blocks in topological order, and the
// first time it reaches a chain of basic blocks, it schedules them in the
// function in-order.

  //     | \
  //     |  \
  //     |   Pred
  //     |   /
  //     Succ
  // In this case, we are evaluating whether to select edge -> Succ, e.g.
  // set Succ as the layout successor of BB. Picking Succ as BB's
  // successor breaks the CFG constraints (FIXME: define these constraints).
  // With this layout, Pred BB
  // is forced to be outlined, so the overall cost will be cost of the
  // branch taken from BB to Pred, plus the cost of back taken branch
  // from Pred to Succ, as well as the additional cost associated
  // with the needed unconditional jump instruction from Pred To Succ.

  // The cost of the topological order layout is the taken branch cost
  // from BB to Succ, so to make BB->Succ a viable candidate, the following
  // must hold:
  //     2 * freq(BB->Pred) * taken_branch_cost + unconditional_jump_cost
  //      < freq(BB->Succ) *  taken_branch_cost.
  // Ignoring unconditional jump cost, we get
  //    freq(BB->Succ) > 2 * freq(BB->Pred), i.e.,
  //    prob(BB->Succ) > 2 * prob(BB->Pred)
  //
  // When real profile data is available, we can precisely compute the
  // probability threshold that is needed for edge BB->Succ to be considered.
  // Without profile data, the heuristic requires the branch bias to be
  // a lot larger to make sure the signal is very strong (e.g. 80% default).
  // -----------------------------------------------------------------
  // Case 2: diamond like CFG (if-then-else):
  //     S
  //    / \
  //   |   \
  //  BB    Pred
  //   \    /
  //    Succ
  //    ..
  //
  // The current block is BB and edge BB->Succ is now being evaluated.
  // Note that edge S->BB was previously already selected because
  // prob(S->BB) > prob(S->Pred).
  // At this point, 2 blocks can be placed after BB: Pred or Succ. If we
  // choose Pred, we will have a topological ordering as shown on the left
  // in the picture below. If we choose Succ, we have the solution as shown
  // on the right:
  //
  //   topo-order:
  //
  //       S-----                             ---S
  //       |    |                             |  |
  //    ---BB   |                             |  BB
  //    |       |                             |  |
  //    |  pred--                             |  Succ--
  //    |  |                                  |       |
  //    ---succ                               ---pred--
  //
  // cost = freq(S->Pred) + freq(BB->Succ)    cost = 2 * freq (S->Pred)
  //      = freq(S->Pred) + freq(S->BB)
  //
  // If we have profile data (i.e, branch probabilities can be trusted), the
  // cost (number of taken branches) with layout S->BB->Succ->Pred is 2 *
  // freq(S->Pred) while the cost of topo order is freq(S->Pred) + freq(S->BB).
  // We know Prob(S->BB) > Prob(S->Pred), so freq(S->BB) > freq(S->Pred), which
  // means the cost of topological order is greater.
  // When profile data is not available, however, we need to be more
  // conservative. If the branch prediction is wrong, breaking the topo-order
  // will actually yield a layout with large cost. For this reason, we need
  // strong biased branch at block S with Prob(S->BB) in order to select
  // BB->Succ. This is equivalent to looking the CFG backward with backward
  // edge: Prob(Succ->BB) needs to >= HotProb in order to be selected (without
  // profile data).
  // --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  // Case 3: forked diamond
