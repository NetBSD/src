# FIXME: For now, override suffixes to exclude any .s tests, because some of the
# buildbots have a stray misched-copy.s output file lying around that causes
# failures. See misched-copy.s where we try and clean up that file.
#
# It should be possible to remove this override once all the bots have cycled
# cleanly.
