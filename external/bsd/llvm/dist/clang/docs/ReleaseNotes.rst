Introduction
============

This document contains the release notes for the Clang C/C++/Objective-C
frontend, part of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, release 5.0.0. Here we
describe the status of Clang in some detail, including major
improvements from the previous release and new feature work. For the
general LLVM release notes, see `the LLVM
documentation <http://llvm.org/docs/ReleaseNotes.html>`_. All LLVM
releases may be downloaded from the `LLVM releases web
site <http://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

For more information about Clang or LLVM, including information about
the latest release, please check out the main please see the `Clang Web
Site <http://clang.llvm.org>`_ or the `LLVM Web
Site <http://llvm.org>`_.

Note that if you are reading this file from a Subversion checkout or the
main Clang web page, this document applies to the *next* release, not
the current one. To see the release notes for a specific release, please

What's New in Clang 5.0.0?
==========================

Some of the major new features and improvements to Clang are listed
here. Generic improvements to Clang as a whole or to its underlying
infrastructure are described first, followed by language-specific
sections with improvements to Clang's support for those languages.

Major New Features
------------------

-  ...

Improvements to Clang's diagnostics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  -Wcast-qual was implemented for C++. C-style casts are now properly
   diagnosed.

-  -Wunused-lambda-capture warns when a variable explicitly captured
   by a lambda is not used in the body of the lambda.

New Compiler Flags
------------------

The option ....

Deprecated Compiler Flags
-------------------------

The following options are deprecated and ignored. They will be removed in
future versions of Clang.

- -fslp-vectorize-aggressive used to enable the BB vectorizing pass. They have been superseeded
  by the normal SLP vectorizer.
- -fno-slp-vectorize-aggressive used to be the default behavior of clang.

New Pragmas in Clang
-----------------------

Clang now supports the ...


Attribute Changes in Clang
--------------------------

-  The ``overloadable`` attribute now allows at most one function with a given
   name to lack the ``overloadable`` attribute. This unmarked function will not
   have its name mangled.

Undefined Behavior Sanitizer (UBSan)
------------------------------------

- The Undefined Behavior Sanitizer has a new check for pointer overflow. This
  check is on by default. The flag to control this functionality is
  -fsanitize=pointer-overflow.

  Pointer overflow is an indicator of undefined behavior: when a pointer
  indexing expression wraps around the address space, or produces other
  unexpected results, its result may not point to a valid object.

- UBSan has several new checks which detect violations of nullability
  annotations. These checks are off by default. The flag to control this group
  of checks is -fsanitize=nullability. The checks can be individially enabled
  by -fsanitize=nullability-arg (which checks calls),
  -fsanitize=nullability-assign (which checks assignments), and
  -fsanitize=nullability-return (which checks return statements).

- UBSan can now detect invalid loads from bitfields and from ObjC BOOLs.

- UBSan can now avoid emitting unnecessary type checks in C++ class methods and
  in several other cases where the result is known at compile-time. UBSan can
  also avoid emitting unnecessary overflow checks in arithmetic expressions
  with promoted integer operands.
