Introduction
============

This document contains the release notes for the Clang C/C++/Objective-C
frontend, part of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, release 3.5. Here we
describe the status of Clang in some detail, including major
improvements from the previous release and new feature work. For the
general LLVM release notes, see `the LLVM
documentation <http://llvm.org/docs/ReleaseNotes.html>`_. All LLVM
releases may be downloaded from the `LLVM releases web
site <http://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

For more information about Clang or LLVM, including information about
the latest release, please check out the main please see the `Clang Web
Site <http://clang.llvm.org>`_ or the `LLVM Web
Site <http://llvm.org>`_.

Note that if you are reading this file from a Subversion checkout or the
main Clang web page, this document applies to the *next* release, not
the current one. To see the release notes for a specific release, please
see the `releases page <http://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

What's New in Clang 3.5?
========================

Some of the major new features and improvements to Clang are listed
here. Generic improvements to Clang as a whole or to its underlying
infrastructure are described first, followed by language-specific
sections with improvements to Clang's support for those languages.

Major New Features
------------------

- Clang uses the new MingW ABI
GCC 4.7 changed the mingw ABI. Clang 3.4 and older use the GCC 4.6
ABI. Clang 3.5 and newer use the GCC 4.7 abi.


Improvements to Clang's diagnostics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clang's diagnostics are constantly being improved to catch more issues,
explain them more clearly, and provide more accurate source information
about them. The improvements since the 3.4 release include:

-  ...

New Compiler Flags
------------------

The integrated assembler is now turned on by default on ARM (and Thumb),
so the use of the option `-integrated-as` is now redundant on those
architectures. This is an important move to both *eat our own dog food*
and to ease cross-compilation tremendously.

We are aware of the problems that this may cause for code bases that
rely on specific GNU syntax or extensions, and we're working towards
getting them all fixed. Please, report bugs or feature requests if
you find anything. In the meantime, use `-no-integrated-as` to revert
back the call to GNU assembler.

API documentation which are up-to-date with the Subversion version of
the source code. You can access versions of these documents specific to
this release by going into the "``clang/docs/``" directory in the Clang
tree.
