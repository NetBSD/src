# Rough instructions for importing new amd release:
#
#	$ cd /some/where/temporary
#	$ tar xpfz /new/amd/release/tar/file
#	$ sh /usr/src/external/bsd/tcpdump/dist/tcpdump2netbsd tcpdump-x.y.z
#	$ cd src/dist/am-utils
#	$ cvs -d cvs.netbsd.org:/cvsroot import -m "Import tcpdump x.y.z" src/external/bsd/tcpdump/dist TCPDUMP tcpdump-x_y_z
#	$ cd ../../../tcpdump-x.y.z
#	$ run ./configure
# copy newly generated config.h with /usr/src/external/bsd/tcpdump/include/config.h
#	- check makefiles to see if any extra sources have been added.
#	- update distrib/sets if necessary.
