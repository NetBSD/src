# ntp2netbsd:  convert a ntp source tree into a
# netbsd ntp source tree, under src/dist,
# based on bind2netbsd by Bernd Ernesti
#
# Rough instructions for importing new NTP release:
#
#	$ cd /some/where/temporary
#	$ tar xpfz /new/ntp/release/tar/file
#	$ sh /usr/src/external/bsd/ntp/ntp2netbsd ntp-4.x.y `pwd`
#	$ cd src/external/bsd/ntp/dist
#	$ cvs import -m "Import ntp 4.x.y" src/external/bsd/ntp/dist UDEL ntp-4-x-y
#	$ cd ../../../../../ntp-4.x.y
#	$ run ./configure  --enable-all-clocks --enable-parse-clocks
#	$ echo cp config.h /usr/src/external/bsd/ntp/include
#         - not really - we have some changed defaults and the vax port has no ieee.h support.
#           so do a careful diff and patch - Frank Kardel
#	$ echo cp scripts/build/mkver /usr/src/external/bsd/ntp/scripts
#		merge possible changes to mkver 
#	        our version uses the import date in the file
#               /usr/src/external/bsd/ntp/importdate for the date and buildnumber information
#		to achieve consistent version string over all builds
#	$ cd ..
#	$ rm -r src ntp-4.x.y
#	$ cd dist/ntpd
#	$ cc -DOPENSSL -I../../include keyword-gen.c -I../include -I../lib/isc/unix/include -I../lib/isc/include -I../../bin/ntpd/obj.amd64-x86_64 -L../../lib/libntp/obj.amd64-x86_64 -lntp -L../../lib/libisc/obj.amd64-x86_64 -lisc -lm
#	$ ./a.out ntp_keyword.h > ntp_keyword.h
#	- Rebuild ntp_keywords file since our parser is not bison and the
#	  keyword numbers are different
#	$ cd /usr/src/external/bsd/ntp
#	$ cvs update
#	$ cvs commit -m "Updated autoconf generated files for ntp 4.x.y."
#
#	- check makefiles to see if any extra sources have been added,
#	  esp. libntp and ntpd.
#	- check for and remove img tags in html docs.
#	- update distrib/sets if necessary.
#       - update src/external/bsd/ntp/importdate to match the date of this import
#	- build in the original distribution directory, then copy all the
#	  generated man pages in the respective program directories
