* Update libisc code using bind-9.6.1-P1.tar.gz, rearrange our copy to
  mirror the upstream layout (lib/isc/...), and merge in NTP-local

  normal bk pull automerge to handle carrying forward any local changes
  and should enable us to take updated libisc snapshots more often.

  to perform a flock-build compatible solitary build, handy for a repo
  clone's first build on a machine with autoconf, automake, etc.

* [Bug 1315] "interface ignore 0.0.0.0" is ignored.
* add implicit "nic ignore all" rule before any rules from ntp.conf, so

* add wildcard match class for interface/nic rules.
* fix mistaken carryover of prefixlen from one rule to the next.
* Ensure IPv6 localhost address ::1 is included in libisc's Windows IPv6
  address enumeration, allowing ntpq and ntpdc's hardcoding to 127.0.0.1 
  on Windows to end.

  I've now spent eleven months of a sabbatical year - 7 days a week, 6-10
  hours most days - working on NTP. I have carefully reviewed every major
  algorithm, examined its original design and evolution from that design.
  I've trimmed off dead code and briar patches and did zillions of tests
  contrived to expose evil vulnerabilities. The development article is in
  rather good shape and should be ready for prime time.

  1. The protostats statistics files have been very useful in exposing
  little twitches and turns when something hiccups, like a broken PPS
  signal. Most of what used to be syslog messages are now repackaged as
  protostats messages with optional syslog as well. These can also be sent
  as traps which might be handy to tiggle a beeper or celltext. These, the
  sysstats files and cryptostats files reveal the ambient health of a busy
  server, monitor traffic and error counts and spot crypto attacks.

  2. Close inspection of the clock discipline behavior at long poll
  intervals (36 h) showed it not doing as well as it should. I redesigned
  the FLL loop to improve nominal accuracy from  several tens of
  milliseconds to something less than ten milliseconds.

  3. Autokey (again). The enhanced error checking was becoming a major
  pain. I found a way to toss out gobs of ugly fat code and replace the
  function with a much simpler and more comprehensive scheme. It resists
  bait-and-switch attacks and quickly detect cases when the protocol is
  not correctly synchronized.

  4. The interface code for the kernel PPS signal was not in sync with the
  kernel code itself. Some error checks were duplicated and some
  ineffective. I found none of the PPS-capable drivers, including the atom
  driver, do anything when the prefer peer fails; the kernel PPS signal
  remains in control. The atom driver now disables the kernel PPS when the
  prefer peer comes bum. This is important when the prefer peer is not a
  reference clock but a remote NTP server.

  5. The flake restrict bit turned out to be really interesting,
  especially with symmtric modes and of those especially those using
  Autokey. Small changes in the recovery procedures when packets are lost
  now avoid almost all scenarios which previously required protocol resets.

  6. I've always been a little uncomfortable when using the clock filter
  with long poll intervals because the samples become less and less
  correlated as the sample age exceeds the Allan intercept. Various
  schemes have been used over the years to cope with this fact. The latest
  one and the one that works the best is to use a modified sort metric
  where the delay is used when the age of the sample is less than the
  intercept and the sum of delay and dispersion above that. The net result
  is that, at small poll intervals the algorithm operates as a minimum
  filter, while at larger poll intervals it morphs to FIFO. Left
  unmodified, a sample could be used when twelve days old. This along with
  the FLL modifications has made a dramatic improvement at large poll
  intervals.

- [Backward Incompatible] The 'state' variable is no longer reported or
  available via ntpq output.  The following system status bit names
  have been changed:
  - sync_alarm -> leap_alarm
  - sync_atomic -> sync_pps
  - sync_lf_clock -> sync_lf_radio
  - sync_hf_clock -> sync_hf_radio
  - sync_uhf_clock -> sync_uhf_radio
  - sync_local_proto -> sync_local
  - sync_udp/time -> sync_other
  Other names have been changed as well.  See the change history for
  libntp/statestr.c for more details.
  Other backward-incompatible changes in ntpq include:
  - assID -> associd
  - rootdispersion -> rootdisp
  - pkt_head -> pkt_neader
  See the change history for other details.
