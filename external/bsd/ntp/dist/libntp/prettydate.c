/* Helper function to handle possible wraparound of the ntp epoch.

   Works by periodic extension of the ntp time stamp in the NTP epoch.  If the
   'time_t' is 32 bit, use solar cycle warping to get the value in a suitable
   range. Also uses solar cycle warping to work around really buggy
   implementations of 'gmtime()' / 'localtime()' that cannot work with a
   negative time value, that is, times before 1970-01-01. (MSVCRT...)

   Apart from that we're assuming that the localtime/gmtime library functions
   have been updated so that they work...

/* solar cycle in secs, unsigned secs and years. And the cycle limits.
**
** And an explanation. The julian calendar repeats ever 28 years, because it's
** the LCM of 7 and 4, the week and leap year cycles. This is called a 'solar
** cycle'. The gregorian calendar does the same as long as no centennial year
** (divisible by 100, but not 400) goes in the way. So between 1901 and 2099
** (inclusive) we can warp time stamps by 28 years to make them suitable for
** localtime() and gmtime() if we have trouble. Of course this will play
** hubbubb with the DST zone switches, so we should do it only if necessary;
** but as we NEED a proper conversion to dates via gmtime() we should try to
** cope with as many idiosyncrasies as possible.
