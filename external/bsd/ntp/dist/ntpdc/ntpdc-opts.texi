This program has no explanation.

The
[= prog-name =]
utility program is used to query an NTP daemon about its
current state and to request changes in that state.
It uses NTP mode 7 control message formats described in the source code.
The program may
be run either in interactive mode or controlled using command line
arguments.
Extensive state and statistics information is available
through the
[= prog-name =]
interface.
In addition, nearly all the
configuration options which can be specified at startup using
ntpd's configuration file may also be specified at run time using
[= prog-name =] .

@itemize @bullet
@item
may appear an unlimited number of times.
@end itemize

The following argument is interpreted as an interactive format command
and is added to the list of commands to be executed on the specified
