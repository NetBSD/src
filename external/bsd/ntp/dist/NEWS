Focus: Security, Bug fixes, enhancements.

Severity: HIGH

In addition to bug fixes and enhancements, this release fixes the
following 1 high- and 4 low-severity vulnerabilities:

* CRYPTO_NAK crash
   Date Resolved: 02 June 2016; Dev (4.3.93) 02 June 2016
   References: Sec 3046 / CVE-2016-4957 / VU#321640
   Affects: ntp-4.2.8p7, and ntp-4.3.92.
   CVSS2: HIGH 7.8 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
   CVSS3: HIGH 7.5 CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
   Summary: The fix for Sec 3007 in ntp-4.2.8p7 contained a bug that
	could cause ntpd to crash.
   Mitigation:
        Implement BCP-38.
        Upgrade to 4.2.8p8, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page
	    or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page
        If you cannot upgrade from 4.2.8p7, the only other alternatives
	    are to patch your code or filter CRYPTO_NAK packets.
        Properly monitor your ntpd instances, and auto-restart ntpd
	    (without -g) if it stops running.

   CVSS2: LOW 2.6 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
   CVSS3: LOW 3.7 CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L
   Summary: An attacker who is able to spoof a packet with a correct
	origin timestamp before the expected response packet arrives at
	the target machine can send a CRYPTO_NAK or a bad MAC and cause
	the association's peer variables to be cleared. If this can be
	done often enough, it will prevent that association from working.
   Mitigation:
	Implement BCP-38.

   Summary: The fix for NtpBug2978 does not cover broadcast associations,
   	so broadcast clients can be triggered to flip into interleave mode.
   Mitigation:
	Implement BCP-38.
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p8, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page
	    or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page

NTP 4.2.8p7 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2016/04/26) 

Focus: Security, Bug fixes, enhancements.

Severity: MEDIUM

When building NTP from source, there is a new configure option
available, --enable-dynamic-interleave.  More information on this below.

Also note that ntp-4.2.8p7 logs more "unexpected events" than previous
versions of ntp.  These events have almost certainly happened in the
past, it's just that they were silently counted and not logged.  With
the increasing awareness around security, we feel it's better to clearly
log these events to help detect abusive behavior.  This increased
logging can also help detect other problems, too.

In addition to bug fixes and enhancements, this release fixes the
following 9 low- and medium-severity vulnerabilities:

* Improve NTP security against buffer comparison timing attacks,
  AKA: authdecrypt-timing
   Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p7) 26 Apr 2016; Dev (4.3.92) 26 Apr 2016
   References: Sec 2879 / CVE-2016-1550
   Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p7, and
	4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.92
   CVSSv2: LOW 2.6 - (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)
   CVSSv3: MED 4.0 - CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
   Summary: Packet authentication tests have been performed using
	memcmp() or possibly bcmp(), and it is potentially possible
	for a local or perhaps LAN-based attacker to send a packet with
	an authentication payload and indirectly observe how much of
	the digest has matched.
   Mitigation:
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p7, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page
	    or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.
	Properly monitor your ntpd instances.

   	Velvindron, and Matthew Van Gundy and Stephen Gray of Cisco ASIG.

* Zero origin timestamp bypass: Additional KoD checks.
   References: Sec 2945 / Sec 2901 / CVE-2015-8138
   Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p7,
   Summary: Improvements to the fixes incorporated in t 4.2.8p6 and 4.3.92.

* peer associations were broken by the fix for NtpBug2899
   Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p7) 26 Apr 2016; Dev (4.3.92) 26 Apr 2016
   References: Sec 2952 / CVE-2015-7704
   Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p7, and
   	4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.92
   CVSSv2: MED 4.3 - (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
   Summary: The fix for NtpBug2952 in ntp-4.2.8p5 to address broken peer
   	associations did not address all of the issues.
   Mitigation:
        Implement BCP-38.
        Upgrade to 4.2.8p7, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page
	    or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page
        If you can't upgrade, use "server" associations instead of
	    "peer" associations.
        Monitor your ntpd instances.

* Validate crypto-NAKs, AKA: CRYPTO-NAK DoS
   Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p7) 26 Apr 2016; Dev (4.3.92) 26 Apr 2016
   References: Sec 3007 / CVE-2016-1547 / VU#718152
   Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p7, and
	4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.92
   CVSS2: MED 4.3 - (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
   CVSS3: MED 3.7 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L
   Summary: For ntp-4 versions up to but not including ntp-4.2.8p7, an
	off-path attacker can cause a preemptable client association to
	be demobilized by sending a crypto NAK packet to a victim client
	with a spoofed source address of an existing associated peer.
	This is true even if authentication is enabled.

	Furthermore, if the attacker keeps sending crypto NAK packets,
	for example one every second, the victim never has a chance to
	reestablish the association and synchronize time with that
	legitimate server.

	For ntp-4.2.8 thru ntp-4.2.8p6 there is less risk because more
	stringent checks are performed on incoming packets, but there
	are still ways to exploit this vulnerability in versions before
	ntp-4.2.8p7.
   Mitigation:
	Implement BCP-38.
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p7, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page
	    or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page
	Properly monitor your =ntpd= instances

   	Matthew Van Gundy of Cisco ASIG.

* ctl_getitem() return value not always checked
   Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p7) 26 Apr 2016; Dev (4.3.92) 26 Apr 2016
   References: Sec 3008 / CVE-2016-2519
   Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p7, and
	4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.92
   CVSSv2: MED 4.9 - (AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:C)
   CVSSv3: MED 4.2 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
   Summary: ntpq and ntpdc can be used to store and retrieve information
   	in ntpd. It is possible to store a data value that is larger
	than the size of the buffer that the ctl_getitem() function of
	ntpd uses to report the return value. If the length of the
	requested data value returned by ctl_getitem() is too large,
	the value NULL is returned instead. There are 2 cases where the
	return value from ctl_getitem() was not directly checked to make
	sure it's not NULL, but there are subsequent INSIST() checks
	that make sure the return value is not NULL. There are no data
	values ordinarily stored in ntpd that would exceed this buffer
	length. But if one has permission to store values and one stores
	a value that is "too large", then ntpd will abort if an attempt
	is made to read that oversized value.
    Mitigation:
        Implement BCP-38.
        Upgrade to 4.2.8p7, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page
	    or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page
        Properly monitor your ntpd instances.

* Crafted addpeer with hmode > 7 causes array wraparound with MATCH_ASSOC 
   Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p7) 26 Apr 2016; Dev (4.3.92) 26 Apr 2016
   References: Sec 3009 / CVE-2016-2518 / VU#718152
   Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p7, and
	4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.92
   CVSS2: LOW 2.1 - (AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:P)
   CVSS3: LOW 2.0 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L
   Summary: Using a crafted packet to create a peer association with
   	hmode > 7 causes the MATCH_ASSOC() lookup to make an
	out-of-bounds reference.
   Mitigation:
	Implement BCP-38.
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p7, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page
	    or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page

* remote configuration trustedkey/requestkey/controlkey values are not
	properly validated
   Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p7) 26 Apr 2016; Dev (4.3.92) 26 Apr 2016
   References: Sec 3010 / CVE-2016-2517 / VU#718152
   Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p7, and
	4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.92
   CVSS2: MED 4.9 - (AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:C)
   CVSS3: MED 4.2 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
   Summary: If ntpd was expressly configured to allow for remote
   	configuration, a malicious user who knows the controlkey for
	ntpq or the requestkey for ntpdc (if mode7 is expressly enabled)
	can create a session with ntpd and then send a crafted packet to
	ntpd that will change the value of the trustedkey, controlkey,
	or requestkey to a value that will prevent any subsequent
	authentication with ntpd until ntpd is restarted.
   Mitigation:
	Implement BCP-38.
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p7, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page
	    or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page
	Properly monitor your =ntpd= instances

   	Security Team, Qihoo 360.

* Duplicate IPs on unconfig directives will cause an assertion botch in ntpd
   Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p7) 26 Apr 2016; Dev (4.3.92) 26 Apr 2016
   References: Sec 3011 / CVE-2016-2516 / VU#718152
   Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p7, and
   	4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.92
   CVSS2: MED 6.3 - (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:C)
   CVSS3: MED 4.2 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
   Summary: If ntpd was expressly configured to allow for remote
   	configuration, a malicious user who knows the controlkey for
	ntpq or the requestkey for ntpdc (if mode7 is expressly enabled)
	can create a session with ntpd and if an existing association is
	unconfigured using the same IP twice on the unconfig directive
	line, ntpd will abort.
   Mitigation:
	Implement BCP-38.
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p7, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page
	    or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page
	Properly monitor your ntpd instances

   	Security Team, Qihoo 360.

* Refclock impersonation vulnerability
   Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p7) 26 Apr 2016; Dev (4.3.92) 26 Apr 2016
   References: Sec 3020 / CVE-2016-1551
   Affects: On a very limited number of OSes, all NTP releases up to but
	not including 4.2.8p7, and 4.3.0 up to but not including 4.3.92.
	By "very limited number of OSes" we mean no general-purpose OSes
	have yet been identified that have this vulnerability.
   CVSSv2: LOW 2.6 - (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
   CVSSv3: LOW 3.7 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
   Summary: While most OSes implement martian packet filtering in their
   	network stack, at least regarding 127.0.0.0/8, some will allow
	packets claiming to be from 127.0.0.0/8 that arrive over a
	physical network. On these OSes, if ntpd is configured to use a
	reference clock an attacker can inject packets over the network
	that look like they are coming from that reference clock.
   Mitigation:
        Implement martian packet filtering and BCP-38.
        Configure ntpd to use an adequate number of time sources.
        Upgrade to 4.2.8p7, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page
	    or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page
        If you are unable to upgrade and if you are running an OS that
	    has this vulnerability, implement martian packet filters and
	    lobby your OS vendor to fix this problem, or run your
	    refclocks on computers that use OSes that are not vulnerable
	    to these attacks and have your vulnerable machines get their
	    time from protected resources.
        Properly monitor your ntpd instances.
   Credit: This weakness was discovered by Matt Street and others of
   	Cisco ASIG. 

The following issues were fixed in earlier releases and contain
improvements in 4.2.8p7:

* Clients that receive a KoD should validate the origin timestamp field.
   References: Sec 2901 / CVE-2015-7704, CVE-2015-7705
   Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p7,
   Summary: Improvements to the fixes incorporated into 4.2.8p4 and 4.3.77.

* Skeleton key: passive server with trusted key can serve time.
   References: Sec 2936 / CVE-2015-7974
   Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p7,
   Summary: Improvements to the fixes incorporated in t 4.2.8p6 and 4.3.90.

Two other vulnerabilities have been reported, and the mitigations
for these are as follows:

* Interleave-pivot
   Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p7) 26 Apr 2016; Dev (4.3.92) 26 Apr 2016
   References: Sec 2978 / CVE-2016-1548
   Affects: All ntp-4 releases.
   CVSSv2: MED 6.4 - (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P)
   CVSSv3: MED 7.2 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L
   Summary: It is possible to change the time of an ntpd client or deny
   	service to an ntpd client by forcing it to change from basic
	client/server mode to interleaved symmetric mode. An attacker
	can spoof a packet from a legitimate ntpd server with an origin
	timestamp that matches the peer->dst timestamp recorded for that
	server. After making this switch, the client will reject all
	future legitimate server responses. It is possible to force the
	victim client to move time after the mode has been changed.
	ntpq gives no indication that the mode has been switched.
   Mitigation:
        Implement BCP-38.
        Upgrade to 4.2.8p7, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page
	    or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.  These
	    versions will not dynamically "flip" into interleave mode
	    unless configured to do so.
        Properly monitor your ntpd instances.

   	and separately by Jonathan Gardner of Cisco ASIG.

* Sybil vulnerability: ephemeral association attack
   Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p7) 26 Apr 2016; Dev (4.3.92) 26 Apr 2016
   References: Sec 3012 / CVE-2016-1549
   Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p7, and
   	4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.92
   CVSSv2: LOW 3.5 - (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N)
   CVSS3v: MED 5.3 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N
   Summary: ntpd can be vulnerable to Sybil attacks. If one is not using
   	the feature introduced in ntp-4.2.8p6 allowing an optional 4th
	field in the ntp.keys file to specify which IPs can serve time,
	a malicious authenticated peer can create arbitrarily-many
	ephemeral associations in order to win the clock selection of
	ntpd and modify a victim's clock.
   Mitigation:
        Implement BCP-38.
        Use the 4th field in the ntp.keys file to specify which IPs
	    can be time servers.
        Properly monitor your ntpd instances.

New option to 'configure':

While looking in to the issues around Bug 2978, the "interleave pivot"
issue, it became clear that there are some intricate and unresolved
issues with interleave operations.  We also realized that the interleave
protocol was never added to the NTPv4 Standard, and it should have been.

Interleave mode was first released in July of 2008, and can be engaged
in two ways.  Any 'peer' and 'broadcast' lines in the ntp.conf file may
contain the 'xleave' option, which will expressly enable interlave mode
for that association.  Additionally, if a time packet arrives and is
found inconsistent with normal protocol behavior but has certain
characteristics that are compatible with interleave mode, NTP will
dynamically switch to interleave mode.  With sufficient knowledge, an
attacker can send a crafted forged packet to an NTP instance that
triggers only one side to enter interleaved mode.

To prevent this attack until we can thoroughly document, describe,
fix, and test the dynamic interleave mode, we've added a new
'configure' option to the build process:

 --enable-dynamic-interleave

This option controls whether or not NTP will, if conditions are right,
engage dynamic interleave mode.  Dynamic interleave mode is disabled by
default in ntp-4.2.8p7.

NTP 4.2.8p6 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2016/01/20) 

Focus: Security, Bug fixes, enhancements.

Severity: MEDIUM

In addition to bug fixes and enhancements, this release fixes the
following 1 low- and 8 medium-severity vulnerabilities:

* Potential Infinite Loop in 'ntpq'
   Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p6) 19 Jan 2016; Dev (4.3.90) 19 Jan 2016
   References: Sec 2548 / CVE-2015-8158
   Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p6, and
	4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.90
   CVSS2: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) Base Score: 4.3 - MEDIUM
   CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N Base Score: 5.3 - MEDIUM
   Summary: 'ntpq' processes incoming packets in a loop in 'getresponse()'.
	The loop's only stopping conditions are receiving a complete and
	correct response or hitting a small number of error conditions.
	If the packet contains incorrect values that don't trigger one of
	the error conditions, the loop continues to receive new packets.
	Note well, this is an attack against an instance of 'ntpq', not
	'ntpd', and this attack requires the attacker to do one of the
	following:
	* Own a malicious NTP server that the client trusts
	* Prevent a legitimate NTP server from sending packets to
	    the 'ntpq' client
	* MITM the 'ntpq' communications between the 'ntpq' client
	    and the NTP server
   Mitigation:
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p6, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page
	or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page

* 0rigin: Zero Origin Timestamp Bypass
   Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p6) 19 Jan 2016; Dev (4.3.90) 19 Jan 2016
   References: Sec 2945 / CVE-2015-8138
   Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p6, and
	4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.90
   CVSS2: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N) Base Score: 5.0 - MEDIUM
   CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N Base Score: 5.3 - MEDIUM
	(3.7 - LOW if you score AC:L)
   Summary: To distinguish legitimate peer responses from forgeries, a
	client attempts to verify a response packet by ensuring that the
	origin timestamp in the packet matches the origin timestamp it
	transmitted in its last request.  A logic error exists that
	allows packets with an origin timestamp of zero to bypass this
	check whenever there is not an outstanding request to the server.
   Mitigation:
	Configure 'ntpd' to get time from multiple sources.
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p6, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page
	    or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.
	Monitor your 'ntpd= instances.

* Stack exhaustion in recursive traversal of restriction list
   Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p6) 19 Jan 2016
   References: Sec 2940 / CVE-2015-7978
   Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p6, and
	4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.90
   CVSS: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) Base Score: 4.3 - MEDIUM
   Summary: An unauthenticated 'ntpdc reslist' command can cause a
   	segmentation fault in ntpd by exhausting the call stack.
   Mitigation:
	Implement BCP-38.
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p6, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page
	    or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.
	If you are unable to upgrade:
            In ntp-4.2.8, mode 7 is disabled by default. Don't enable it.
	    If you must enable mode 7:
		configure the use of a 'requestkey' to control who can
		    issue mode 7 requests.
		configure 'restrict noquery' to further limit mode 7
		    requests to trusted sources.
		Monitor your ntpd instances.

* Off-path Denial of Service (!DoS) attack on authenticated broadcast mode
   Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p6) 19 Jan 2016; Dev (4.3.90) 19 Jan 2016
   References: Sec 2942 / CVE-2015-7979
   Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p6, and
	4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.90
   CVSS: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P) Base Score: 5.8
   Summary: An off-path attacker can send broadcast packets with bad
	authentication (wrong key, mismatched key, incorrect MAC, etc)
	to broadcast clients. It is observed that the broadcast client
	tears down the association with the broadcast server upon
	receiving just one bad packet.
   Mitigation:
	Implement BCP-38.
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p6, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page
	or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.
	Monitor your 'ntpd' instances.
	If this sort of attack is an active problem for you, you have
	    deeper problems to investigate.  In this case also consider
	    having smaller NTP broadcast domains.

   	University.

* reslist NULL pointer dereference
   Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p6) 19 Jan 2016; Dev (4.3.90) 19 Jan 2016
   References: Sec 2939 / CVE-2015-7977
   Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p6, and
	4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.90
   CVSS: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) Base Score: 4.3 - MEDIUM
   Summary: An unauthenticated 'ntpdc reslist' command can cause a
	segmentation fault in ntpd by causing a NULL pointer dereference.
   Mitigation:
	Implement BCP-38.
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p6, or later, from NTP Project Download Page or
	the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.
	If you are unable to upgrade:
	    mode 7 is disabled by default.  Don't enable it.
	    If you must enable mode 7:
		configure the use of a 'requestkey' to control who can
		    issue mode 7 requests.
		configure 'restrict noquery' to further limit mode 7
		    requests to trusted sources. 
	Monitor your ntpd instances.

* 'ntpq saveconfig' command allows dangerous characters in filenames.
   Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p6) 19 Jan 2016; Dev (4.3.90) 19 Jan 2016
   References: Sec 2938 / CVE-2015-7976
   Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p6, and
	4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.90
   CVSS: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N) Base Score: 4.0 - MEDIUM
   Summary: The ntpq saveconfig command does not do adequate filtering
   	of special characters from the supplied filename.
	Note well: The ability to use the saveconfig command is controlled
	by the 'restrict nomodify' directive, and the recommended default
	configuration is to disable this capability.  If the ability to
	execute a 'saveconfig' is required, it can easily (and should) be
	limited and restricted to a known small number of IP addresses.
   Mitigation:
	Implement BCP-38.
	use 'restrict default nomodify' in your 'ntp.conf' file.
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p6, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page.
	If you are unable to upgrade:
	    build NTP with 'configure --disable-saveconfig' if you will
	    	never need this capability, or
	    use 'restrict default nomodify' in your 'ntp.conf' file.  Be
		careful about what IPs have the ability to send 'modify'
		requests to 'ntpd'.
	Monitor your ntpd instances.
	'saveconfig' requests are logged to syslog - monitor your syslog files.

* nextvar() missing length check in ntpq
   Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p6) 19 Jan 2016; Dev (4.3.90) 19 Jan 2016
   References: Sec 2937 / CVE-2015-7975
   Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p6, and
	4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.90
   CVSS: (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) Base Score: 1.2 - LOW
	If you score A:C, this becomes 4.0.
   CVSSv3: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) Base Score 2.9, LOW
   Summary: ntpq may call nextvar() which executes a memcpy() into the
	name buffer without a proper length check against its maximum
	length of 256 bytes. Note well that we're taking about ntpq here.
	The usual worst-case effect of this vulnerability is that the
	specific instance of ntpq will crash and the person or process
	that did this will have stopped themselves.
   Mitigation:
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p6, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page
	    or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.
	If you are unable to upgrade:
	    If you have scripts that feed input to ntpq make sure there are
		some sanity checks on the input received from the "outside".
	    This is potentially more dangerous if ntpq is run as root.

* Skeleton Key: Any trusted key system can serve time
   Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p6) 19 Jan 2016; Dev (4.3.90) 19 Jan 2016
   References: Sec 2936 / CVE-2015-7974
   Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p6, and
	4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.90
   CVSS: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:N/I:C/A:N) Base Score: 4.9
   Summary: Symmetric key encryption uses a shared trusted key. The
	reported title for this issue was "Missing key check allows
	impersonation between authenticated peers" and the report claimed
	"A key specified only for one server should only work to
	authenticate that server, other trusted keys should be refused."
	Except there has never been any correlation between this trusted
	key and server v. clients machines and there has never been any
	way to specify a key only for one server. We have treated this as
	an enhancement request, and ntp-4.2.8p6 includes other checks and
	tests to strengthen clients against attacks coming from broadcast
	servers.
   Mitigation:
	Implement BCP-38.
	If this scenario represents a real or a potential issue for you,
	    upgrade to 4.2.8p6, or later, from the NTP Project Download
	    Page or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page, and
	    use the new field in the ntp.keys file that specifies the list
	    of IPs that are allowed to serve time. Note that this alone
	    will not protect against time packets with forged source IP
	    addresses, however other changes in ntp-4.2.8p6 provide
	    significant mitigation against broadcast attacks. MITM attacks
	    are a different story.
	If you are unable to upgrade:
	    Don't use broadcast mode if you cannot monitor your client
	    	servers.
	    If you choose to use symmetric keys to authenticate time
	    	packets in a hostile environment where ephemeral time
		servers can be created, or if it is expected that malicious
		time servers will participate in an NTP broadcast domain,
		limit the number of participating systems that participate
		in the shared-key group. 
	Monitor your ntpd instances.

* Deja Vu: Replay attack on authenticated broadcast mode
   Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p6) 19 Jan 2016; Dev (4.3.90) 19 Jan 2016
   References: Sec 2935 / CVE-2015-7973
   Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p6, and
   	4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.90
   CVSS: (AV:A/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P) Base Score: 4.3 - MEDIUM
   Summary: If an NTP network is configured for broadcast operations then
   	either a man-in-the-middle attacker or a malicious participant
	that has the same trusted keys as the victim can replay time packets.
   Mitigation:
	Implement BCP-38.
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p6, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page
	    or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.
	If you are unable to upgrade:
	    Don't use broadcast mode if you cannot monitor your client servers.
	Monitor your ntpd instances.

NTP 4.2.8p5 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2016/01/07) 

Focus: Security, Bug fixes, enhancements.

Severity: MEDIUM

In addition to bug fixes and enhancements, this release fixes the
following medium-severity vulnerability:

* Small-step/big-step.  Close the panic gate earlier.
    References: Sec 2956, CVE-2015-5300
    Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p5, and
	4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.78
    CVSS3: (AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:L) Base Score: 4.0, MEDIUM
    Summary: If ntpd is always started with the -g option, which is
	common and against long-standing recommendation, and if at the
	moment ntpd is restarted an attacker can immediately respond to
	enough requests from enough sources trusted by the target, which
	is difficult and not common, there is a window of opportunity
	where the attacker can cause ntpd to set the time to an
	arbitrary value. Similarly, if an attacker is able to respond
	to enough requests from enough sources trusted by the target,
	the attacker can cause ntpd to abort and restart, at which
	point it can tell the target to set the time to an arbitrary
	value if and only if ntpd was re-started against long-standing
	recommendation with the -g flag, or if ntpd was not given the
	-g flag, the attacker can move the target system's time by at
	most 900 seconds' time per attack.
    Mitigation:
	Configure ntpd to get time from multiple sources.
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p5, or later, from the NTP Project Download
	    Page or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page
	As we've long documented, only use the -g option to ntpd in
	    cold-start situations.
	Monitor your ntpd instances. 
    Credit: This weakness was discovered by Aanchal Malhotra,
	Isaac E. Cohen, and Sharon Goldberg at Boston University. 

    NOTE WELL: The -g flag disables the limit check on the panic_gate
	in ntpd, which is 900 seconds by default. The bug identified by
	the researchers at Boston University is that the panic_gate
	check was only re-enabled after the first change to the system
	clock that was greater than 128 milliseconds, by default. The
	correct behavior is that the panic_gate check should be
	re-enabled after any initial time correction.

	If an attacker is able to inject consistent but erroneous time
	responses to your systems via the network or "over the air",
	perhaps by spoofing radio, cellphone, or navigation satellite
	transmissions, they are in a great position to affect your
	system's clock. There comes a point where your very best
	defenses include:

	    Configure ntpd to get time from multiple sources.
	    Monitor your ntpd instances.

NTP 4.2.8p4 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2015/10/21) 

Focus: Security, Bug fixes, enhancements.

Severity: MEDIUM

In addition to bug fixes and enhancements, this release fixes the
following 13 low- and medium-severity vulnerabilities:

* Incomplete vallen (value length) checks in ntp_crypto.c, leading
  to potential crashes or potential code injection/information leakage.

    References: Sec 2899, Sec 2671, CVE-2015-7691, CVE-2015-7692, CVE-2015-7702
    Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p4,
    	and 4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.77
    CVSS: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:M/C:N/I:N/A:C) Base Score: 4.6
    Summary: The fix for CVE-2014-9750 was incomplete in that there were
    	certain code paths where a packet with particular autokey operations
	that contained malicious data was not always being completely
	validated. Receipt of these packets can cause ntpd to crash.
    Mitigation:
        Don't use autokey.
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p4, or later, from the NTP Project Download
	    Page or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page
	Monitor your ntpd instances. 
	Credit: This weakness was discovered by Tenable Network Security. 

* Clients that receive a KoD should validate the origin timestamp field.

    References: Sec 2901 / CVE-2015-7704, CVE-2015-7705
    Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p4,
	and 4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.77
    CVSS: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) Base Score: 4.3-5.0 at worst
    Summary: An ntpd client that honors Kiss-of-Death responses will honor
    	KoD messages that have been forged by an attacker, causing it to
	delay or stop querying its servers for time updates. Also, an
	attacker can forge packets that claim to be from the target and
	send them to servers often enough that a server that implements
	KoD rate limiting will send the target machine a KoD response to
	attempt to reduce the rate of incoming packets, or it may also
	trigger a firewall block at the server for packets from the target
	machine. For either of these attacks to succeed, the attacker must
	know what servers the target is communicating with. An attacker
	can be anywhere on the Internet and can frequently learn the
	identity of the target's time source by sending the target a
	time query.
    Mitigation:
        Implement BCP-38.
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p4, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page
	    or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page
	If you can't upgrade, restrict who can query ntpd to learn who
	    its servers are, and what IPs are allowed to ask your system
	    for the time. This mitigation is heavy-handed.
	Monitor your ntpd instances. 
    Note:
    	4.2.8p4 protects against the first attack. For the second attack,
    	all we can do is warn when it is happening, which we do in 4.2.8p4.

    	Issac E. Cohen, and Sharon Goldberg of Boston University. 

* configuration directives to change "pidfile" and "driftfile" should
  only be allowed locally. 

  References: Sec 2902 / CVE-2015-5196
  Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p4,
	and 4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.77
   CVSS: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:M/C:N/I:C/A:C) Base Score: 6.2 worst case
   Summary: If ntpd is configured to allow for remote configuration,
	and if the (possibly spoofed) source IP address is allowed to
	send remote configuration requests, and if the attacker knows
	the remote configuration password, it's possible for an attacker
	to use the "pidfile" or "driftfile" directives to potentially
	overwrite other files.
   Mitigation:
	Implement BCP-38.
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p4, or later, from the NTP Project Download
	    Page or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page
	If you cannot upgrade, don't enable remote configuration.
	If you must enable remote configuration and cannot upgrade,
	    remote configuration of NTF's ntpd requires:
	    - an explicitly configured trustedkey, and you should also
	    	configure a controlkey.
	    - access from a permitted IP. You choose the IPs.

* Slow memory leak in CRYPTO_ASSOC 

  References: Sec 2909 / CVE-2015-7701
  Affects: All ntp-4 releases that use autokey up to, but not
    including 4.2.8p4, and 4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.77
  CVSS: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:M/C:N/I:N/A:C) Base Score: 0.0 best/usual case,
  	4.6 otherwise
  Summary: If ntpd is configured to use autokey, then an attacker can
	send packets to ntpd that will, after several days of ongoing
	attack, cause it to run out of memory.
  Mitigation:
	Don't use autokey.

  Mitigation:
	Implement BCP-38.
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p4, or later, from the NTP Project Download
	    Page or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.
	      If you are unable to upgrade:
	In ntp-4.2.8, mode 7 is disabled by default. Don't enable it.
	If you must enable mode 7:
	    configure the use of a requestkey to control who can issue
		mode 7 requests.
	    configure restrict noquery to further limit mode 7 requests
		to trusted sources.

  CVSS: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P) Base Score: 4.0, worst case
  Summary: If an attacker can figure out the precise moment that ntpq
	is listening for data and the port number it is listening on or

* Invalid length data provided by a custom refclock driver could cause
  a buffer overflow. 

  References: Sec 2920 / CVE-2015-7853 / TALOS-CAN-0064
  Affects: Potentially all ntp-4 releases running up to, but not
	including 4.2.8p4, and 4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.77
	that have custom refclocks
  CVSS: (AV:L/AC:H/Au:M/C:C/I:C/A:C) Base Score: 0.0 usual case,
	5.9 unusual worst case
  Summary: A negative value for the datalen parameter will overflow a
	data buffer. NTF's ntpd driver implementations always set this
	value to 0 and are therefore not vulnerable to this weakness.
	If you are running a custom refclock driver in ntpd and that
	driver supplies a negative value for datalen (no custom driver
	of even minimal competence would do this) then ntpd would
	overflow a data buffer. It is even hypothetically possible
	in this case that instead of simply crashing ntpd the attacker
	could effect a code injection attack.
  Mitigation:
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p4, or later, from the NTP Project Download
	    Page or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.
	If you are unable to upgrade:
		If you are running custom refclock drivers, make sure
			the signed datalen value is either zero or positive.

Backward-Incompatible changes:
* [Bug 2817] Default on Linux is now "rlimit memlock -1".
  While the general default of 32M is still the case, under Linux
  the default value has been changed to -1 (do not lock ntpd into
  memory).  A value of 0 means "lock ntpd into memory with whatever
  memory it needs." If your ntp.conf file has an explicit "rlimit memlock"
  value in it, that value will continue to be used.

* [Bug 2886] Misspelling: "outlyer" should be "outlier".
  If you've written a script that looks for this case in, say, the
  output of ntpq, you probably want to change your regex matches
  from 'outlyer' to 'outl[iy]er'.

New features in this release:
* 'rlimit memlock' now has finer-grained control.  A value of -1 means
  "don't lock ntpd into memore".  This is the default for Linux boxes.
  A value of 0 means "lock ntpd into memory" with no limits.  Otherwise
  the value is the number of megabytes of memory to lock.  The default
  is 32 megabytes.

* The old Google Test framework has been replaced with a new framework,
  based on http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity/ .

NTP 4.2.8p3 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2015/06/29) 

Focus: 1 Security fix.  Bug fixes and enhancements.  Leap-second improvements.

Severity: MEDIUM

Security Fix:

* [Sec 2853] Crafted remote config packet can crash some versions of
  ntpd.  Aleksis Kauppinen, Juergen Perlinger, Harlan Stenn.

Under specific circumstances an attacker can send a crafted packet to
cause a vulnerable ntpd instance to crash. This requires each of the
following to be true:

1) ntpd set up to allow remote configuration (not allowed by default), and
2) knowledge of the configuration password, and
3) access to a computer entrusted to perform remote configuration. 

This vulnerability is considered low-risk.

New features in this release:

Optional (disabled by default) support to have ntpd provide smeared
leap second time.  A specially built and configured ntpd will only
offer smeared time in response to client packets.  These response
packets will also contain a "refid" of 254.a.b.c, where the 24 bits
of a, b, and c encode the amount of smear in a 2:22 integer:fraction 
format.  See README.leapsmear and http://bugs.ntp.org/2855 for more
information.

   *IF YOU CHOOSE TO CONFIGURE NTPD TO PROVIDE LEAP SMEAR TIME*
   *BE SURE YOU DO NOT OFFER THAT TIME ON PUBLIC TIMESERVERS.*

We've imported the Unity test framework, and have begun converting
the existing google-test items to this new framework.  If you want
to write new tests or change old ones, you'll need to have ruby
installed.  You don't need ruby to run the test suite.

Bug Fixes and Improvements:

* CID 739725: Fix a rare resource leak in libevent/listener.c.
* CID 1295478: Quiet a pedantic potential error from the fix for Bug 2776.
* CID 1296235: Fix refclock_jjy.c and correcting type of the driver40-ja.html

* [Bug 2590] autogen-5.18.5.
* [Bug 2612] restrict: Warn when 'monitor' can't be disabled because
  of 'limited'.
* [Bug 2650] fix includefile processing.
* [Bug 2745] ntpd -x steps clock on leap second
   Fixed an initial-value problem that caused misbehaviour in absence of
   any leapsecond information.
   Do leap second stepping only of the step adjustment is beyond the
   proper jump distance limit and step correction is allowed at all.
* [Bug 2750] build for Win64
  Building for 32bit of loopback ppsapi needs def file
* [Bug 2776] Improve ntpq's 'help keytype'.
* [Bug 2778] Implement "apeers"  ntpq command to include associd.
* [Bug 2782] Refactor refclock_shm.c, add memory barrier protection.
* [Bug 2792] If the IFF_RUNNING interface flag is supported then an
  interface is ignored as long as this flag is not set since the
  interface is not usable (e.g., no link).
* [Bug 2794] Clean up kernel clock status reports.
* [Bug 2800] refclock_true.c true_debug() can't open debug log because
  of incompatible open/fdopen parameters.
* [Bug 2804] install-local-data assumes GNU 'find' semantics.
* [Bug 2805] ntpd fails to join multicast group.

NTP 4.2.8p2 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2015/04/07) 

Focus: Security and Bug fixes, enhancements.

Severity: MEDIUM
 
In addition to bug fixes and enhancements, this release fixes the
following medium-severity vulnerabilities involving private key
authentication:

* [Sec 2779] ntpd accepts unauthenticated packets with symmetric key crypto.

    References: Sec 2779 / CVE-2015-1798 / VU#374268
    Affects: All NTP4 releases starting with ntp-4.2.5p99 up to but not
	including ntp-4.2.8p2 where the installation uses symmetric keys
	to authenticate remote associations.
    CVSS: (AV:A/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) Base Score: 5.4
    Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p2) 07 Apr 2015
    Summary: When ntpd is configured to use a symmetric key to authenticate
	a remote NTP server/peer, it checks if the NTP message
	authentication code (MAC) in received packets is valid, but not if
	there actually is any MAC included. Packets without a MAC are
	accepted as if they had a valid MAC. This allows a MITM attacker to
	send false packets that are accepted by the client/peer without
	having to know the symmetric key. The attacker needs to know the
	transmit timestamp of the client to match it in the forged reply
	and the false reply needs to reach the client before the genuine
	reply from the server. The attacker doesn't necessarily need to be
	relaying the packets between the client and the server.

	Authentication using autokey doesn't have this problem as there is
	a check that requires the key ID to be larger than NTP_MAXKEY,
	which fails for packets without a MAC.
    Mitigation:
        Upgrade to 4.2.8p2, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page
	or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page
        Configure ntpd with enough time sources and monitor it properly. 
    Credit: This issue was discovered by Miroslav Lichvar, of Red Hat. 

* [Sec 2781] Authentication doesn't protect symmetric associations against
  DoS attacks.

    References: Sec 2781 / CVE-2015-1799 / VU#374268
    Affects: All NTP releases starting with at least xntp3.3wy up to but
	not including ntp-4.2.8p2 where the installation uses symmetric
	key authentication.
    CVSS: (AV:A/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) Base Score: 5.4
    Note: the CVSS base Score for this issue could be 4.3 or lower, and
	it could be higher than 5.4.
    Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p2) 07 Apr 2015
    Summary: An attacker knowing that NTP hosts A and B are peering with
	each other (symmetric association) can send a packet to host A
	with source address of B which will set the NTP state variables
	on A to the values sent by the attacker. Host A will then send
	on its next poll to B a packet with originate timestamp that
	doesn't match the transmit timestamp of B and the packet will
	be dropped. If the attacker does this periodically for both
	hosts, they won't be able to synchronize to each other. This is
	a known denial-of-service attack, described at
	https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/onwire.html .

	According to the document the NTP authentication is supposed to
	protect symmetric associations against this attack, but that
	doesn't seem to be the case. The state variables are updated even
	when authentication fails and the peers are sending packets with
	originate timestamps that don't match the transmit timestamps on
	the receiving side.

	This seems to be a very old problem, dating back to at least
	xntp3.3wy. It's also in the NTPv3 (RFC 1305) and NTPv4 (RFC 5905)
	specifications, so other NTP implementations with support for
	symmetric associations and authentication may be vulnerable too.
	An update to the NTP RFC to correct this error is in-process.
    Mitigation:
        Upgrade to 4.2.8p2, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page
	or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page
        Note that for users of autokey, this specific style of MITM attack
	is simply a long-known potential problem.
        Configure ntpd with appropriate time sources and monitor ntpd.
	Alert your staff if problems are detected. 
    Credit: This issue was discovered by Miroslav Lichvar, of Red Hat. 

* New script: update-leap
The update-leap script will verify and if necessary, update the
leap-second definition file.
It requires the following commands in order to work:

	wget logger tr sed shasum

Some may choose to run this from cron.  It needs more portability testing.

Bug Fixes and Improvements:

* [Bug 1787] DCF77's formerly "antenna" bit is "call bit" since 2003.
* [Bug 1960] setsockopt IPV6_MULTICAST_IF: Invalid argument.

NTP 4.2.8p1 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2015/02/04) 

Focus: Security and Bug fixes, enhancements.

Severity: HIGH
 
In addition to bug fixes and enhancements, this release fixes the
following high-severity vulnerabilities:

* vallen is not validated in several places in ntp_crypto.c, leading
  to a potential information leak or possibly a crash

    References: Sec 2671 / CVE-2014-9297 / VU#852879
    Affects: All NTP4 releases before 4.2.8p1 that are running autokey.
    CVSS: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) Base Score: 7.5
    Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p1) 04 Feb 2015
    Summary: The vallen packet value is not validated in several code
             paths in ntp_crypto.c which can lead to information leakage
	     or perhaps a crash of the ntpd process.
    Mitigation - any of:
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p1, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page
		or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.
	Disable Autokey Authentication by removing, or commenting out,
		all configuration directives beginning with the "crypto"
		keyword in your ntp.conf file. 
    Credit: This vulnerability was discovered by Stephen Roettger of the
    	Google Security Team, with additional cases found by Sebastian
	Krahmer of the SUSE Security Team and Harlan Stenn of Network
	Time Foundation. 

* ::1 can be spoofed on some OSes, so ACLs based on IPv6 ::1 addresses
  can be bypassed.

    References: Sec 2672 / CVE-2014-9298 / VU#852879
    Affects: All NTP4 releases before 4.2.8p1, under at least some
	versions of MacOS and Linux. *BSD has not been seen to be vulnerable.
    CVSS: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C) Base Score: 9
    Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p1) 04 Feb 2014
    Summary: While available kernels will prevent 127.0.0.1 addresses
	from "appearing" on non-localhost IPv4 interfaces, some kernels
	do not offer the same protection for ::1 source addresses on
	IPv6 interfaces. Since NTP's access control is based on source
	address and localhost addresses generally have no restrictions,
	an attacker can send malicious control and configuration packets
	by spoofing ::1 addresses from the outside. Note Well: This is
	not really a bug in NTP, it's a problem with some OSes. If you
	have one of these OSes where ::1 can be spoofed, ALL ::1 -based
	ACL restrictions on any application can be bypassed!
    Mitigation:
        Upgrade to 4.2.8p1, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page
	or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page
        Install firewall rules to block packets claiming to come from
	::1 from inappropriate network interfaces.

	the Google Security Team. 

Additionally, over 30 bugfixes and improvements were made to the codebase.

NTP 4.2.8 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2014/12/18) 
 
Focus: Security and Bug fixes, enhancements.
 
Severity: HIGH
 
In addition to bug fixes and enhancements, this release fixes the
following high-severity vulnerabilities:

************************** vv NOTE WELL vv *****************************

The vulnerabilities listed below can be significantly mitigated by
following the BCP of putting

 restrict default ... noquery

in the ntp.conf file.  With the exception of:

   receive(): missing return on error
   References: Sec 2670 / CVE-2014-9296 / VU#852879

below (which is a limited-risk vulnerability), none of the recent
vulnerabilities listed below can be exploited if the source IP is
restricted from sending a 'query'-class packet by your ntp.conf file.

************************** ^^ NOTE WELL ^^ *****************************

* Weak default key in config_auth().

  References: [Sec 2665] / CVE-2014-9293 / VU#852879
  CVSS: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:M/C:P/I:P/A:C) Base Score: 7.3
  Vulnerable Versions: all releases prior to 4.2.7p11
  Date Resolved: 28 Jan 2010

  Summary: If no 'auth' key is set in the configuration file, ntpd
	would generate a random key on the fly.  There were two
	problems with this: 1) the generated key was 31 bits in size,
	and 2) it used the (now weak) ntp_random() function, which was
	seeded with a 32-bit value and could only provide 32 bits of
	entropy.  This was sufficient back in the late 1990s when the
	code was written.  Not today.

  Mitigation - any of:
	- Upgrade to 4.2.7p11 or later.
	- Follow BCP and put 'restrict ... noquery' in your ntp.conf file.

  	of the Google Security Team.

* Non-cryptographic random number generator with weak seed used by
  ntp-keygen to generate symmetric keys.

  Vulnerable Versions: All NTP4 releases before 4.2.7p230
  Date Resolved: Dev (4.2.7p230) 01 Nov 2011

  Summary: Prior to ntp-4.2.7p230 ntp-keygen used a weak seed to
  	prepare a random number generator that was of good quality back
	in the late 1990s. The random numbers produced was then used to
	generate symmetric keys. In ntp-4.2.8 we use a current-technology
	cryptographic random number generator, either RAND_bytes from
	OpenSSL, or arc4random(). 

  Mitigation - any of:
  	- Upgrade to 4.2.7p230 or later.
	- Follow BCP and put 'restrict ... noquery' in your ntp.conf file.

  Versions: All releases before 4.2.8
  Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8) 18 Dec 2014

  Summary: When Autokey Authentication is enabled (i.e. the ntp.conf
  	file contains a 'crypto pw ...' directive) a remote attacker
	can send a carefully crafted packet that can overflow a stack
	buffer and potentially allow malicious code to be executed
	with the privilege level of the ntpd process.

  Mitigation - any of:
  	- Upgrade to 4.2.8, or later, or
	- Disable Autokey Authentication by removing, or commenting out,
	  all configuration directives beginning with the crypto keyword
	  in your ntp.conf file.

  Summary: Code in ntp_proto.c:receive() was missing a 'return;' in
  	the code path where an error was detected, which meant
	processing did not stop when a specific rare error occurred.
	We haven't found a way for this bug to affect system integrity.

New features / changes in this release:

Important Changes

* Internal NTP Era counters

The internal counters that track the "era" (range of years) we are in
rolls over every 136 years'.  The current "era" started at the stroke of
midnight on 1 Jan 1900, and ends just before the stroke of midnight on
1 Jan 2036.
In the past, we have used the "midpoint" of the  range to decide which
era we were in.  Given the longevity of some products, it became clear
that it would be more functional to "look back" less, and "look forward"
more.  We now compile a timestamp into the ntpd executable and when we
get a timestamp we us the "built-on" to tell us what era we are in.
This check "looks back" 10 years, and "looks forward" 126 years.

* ntpdc responses disabled by default

Dave Hart writes:

For a long time, ntpq and its mostly text-based mode 6 (control) 
protocol have been preferred over ntpdc and its mode 7 (private 
request) protocol for runtime queries and configuration.  There has 
been a goal of deprecating ntpdc, previously held back by numerous 
capabilities exposed by ntpdc with no ntpq equivalent.  I have been 
adding commands to ntpq to cover these cases, and I believe I've 
covered them all, though I've not compared command-by-command 
recently. 

As I've said previously, the binary mode 7 protocol involves a lot of 
hand-rolled structure layout and byte-swapping code in both ntpd and 
ntpdc which is hard to get right.  As ntpd grows and changes, the 
changes are difficult to expose via ntpdc while maintaining forward 
and backward compatibility between ntpdc and ntpd.  In contrast, 
ntpq's text-based, label=value approach involves more code reuse and 
allows compatible changes without extra work in most cases. 

Mode 7 has always been defined as vendor/implementation-specific while 
mode 6 is described in RFC 1305 and intended to be open to interoperate 
with other implementations.  There is an early draft of an updated 
mode 6 description that likely will join the other NTPv4 RFCs 
eventually. (http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-odonoghue-ntpv4-control-01)

For these reasons, ntpd 4.2.7p230 by default disables processing of 
ntpdc queries, reducing ntpd's attack surface and functionally 
deprecating ntpdc.  If you are in the habit of using ntpdc for certain 
operations, please try the ntpq equivalent.  If there's no equivalent, 
please open a bug report at http://bugs.ntp.org./

In addition to the above, over 1100 issues have been resolved between
the 4.2.6 branch and 4.2.8.  The ChangeLog file in the distribution
lists these.

NTP 4.2.6p5 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2011/12/24) 
 
Focus: Bug fixes
 
Severity: Medium 
 
This is a recommended upgrade. 

This release updates sys_rootdisp and sys_jitter calculations to match the
RFC specification, fixes a potential IPv6 address matching error for the
"nic" and "interface" configuration directives, suppresses the creation of
extraneous ephemeral associations for certain broadcastclient and
multicastclient configurations, cleans up some ntpq display issues, and
includes improvements to orphan mode, minor bugs fixes and code clean-ups.

New features / changes in this release:

ntpd

 * Updated "nic" and "interface" IPv6 address handling to prevent 
   mismatches with localhost [::1] and wildcard [::] which resulted from
   using the address/prefix format (e.g. fe80::/64)
 * Fix orphan mode stratum incorrectly counting to infinity
 * Orphan parent selection metric updated to includes missing ntohl()
 * Non-printable stratum 16 refid no longer sent to ntp
 * Duplicate ephemeral associations suppressed for broadcastclient and
   multicastclient without broadcastdelay
 * Exclude undetermined sys_refid from use in loopback TEST12
 * Exclude MODE_SERVER responses from KoD rate limiting
 * Include root delay in clock_update() sys_rootdisp calculations
 * get_systime() updated to exclude sys_residual offset (which only
   affected bits "below" sys_tick, the precision threshold)
 * sys.peer jitter weighting corrected in sys_jitter calculation

ntpq

 * -n option extended to include the billboard "server" column
 * IPv6 addresses in the local column truncated to prevent overruns

NTP 4.2.6 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2009/12/08)

Focus: enhancements and bug fixes.

---
NTP 4.2.4p8 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2009/12/08)

Focus: Security Fixes

Severity: HIGH

This release fixes the following high-severity vulnerability:

* [Sec 1331] DoS with mode 7 packets - CVE-2009-3563.

  See http://support.ntp.org/security for more information.

  NTP mode 7 (MODE_PRIVATE) is used by the ntpdc query and control utility.
  In contrast, ntpq uses NTP mode 6 (MODE_CONTROL), while routine NTP time
  transfers use modes 1 through 5.  Upon receipt of an incorrect mode 7
  request or a mode 7 error response from an address which is not listed
  in a "restrict ... noquery" or "restrict ... ignore" statement, ntpd will
  reply with a mode 7 error response (and log a message).  In this case:

	* If an attacker spoofs the source address of ntpd host A in a
	  mode 7 response packet sent to ntpd host B, both A and B will
	  continuously send each other error responses, for as long as
	  those packets get through.

	* If an attacker spoofs an address of ntpd host A in a mode 7
	  response packet sent to ntpd host A, A will respond to itself
	  endlessly, consuming CPU and logging excessively.

  Credit for finding this vulnerability goes to Robin Park and Dmitri
  Vinokurov of Alcatel-Lucent.

THIS IS A STRONGLY RECOMMENDED UPGRADE.

---
ntpd now syncs to refclocks right away.

Backward-Incompatible changes:

ntpd no longer accepts '-v name' or '-V name' to define internal variables.
Use '--var name' or '--dvar name' instead. (Bug 817)

NTP 4.2.4p7 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2009/05/04)

Focus: Security and Bug Fixes

Severity: HIGH

This release fixes the following high-severity vulnerability:

* [Sec 1151] Remote exploit if autokey is enabled.  CVE-2009-1252

  See http://support.ntp.org/security for more information.

  If autokey is enabled (if ntp.conf contains a "crypto pw whatever"
  line) then a carefully crafted packet sent to the machine will cause
  a buffer overflow and possible execution of injected code, running
  with the privileges of the ntpd process (often root).

  Credit for finding this vulnerability goes to Chris Ries of CMU.

This release fixes the following low-severity vulnerabilities:

* [Sec 1144] limited (two byte) buffer overflow in ntpq.  CVE-2009-0159
  Credit for finding this vulnerability goes to Geoff Keating of Apple.
  
* [Sec 1149] use SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE on Windows
  Credit for finding this issue goes to Dave Hart.

This release fixes a number of bugs and adds some improvements:

* Improved logging
* Fix many compiler warnings
* Many fixes and improvements for Windows
* Adds support for AIX 6.1
* Resolves some issues under MacOS X and Solaris

THIS IS A STRONGLY RECOMMENDED UPGRADE.

NTP 4.2.4p6 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2009/01/07)

Focus: Security Fix

Severity: Low

This release fixes oCERT.org's CVE-2009-0021, a vulnerability affecting
the OpenSSL library relating to the incorrect checking of the return
value of EVP_VerifyFinal function.

Credit for finding this issue goes to the Google Security Team for
finding the original issue with OpenSSL, and to ocert.org for finding
the problem in NTP and telling us about it.

This is a recommended upgrade.

NTP 4.2.4p5 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2008/08/17)

Focus: Minor Bugfixes 

This release fixes a number of Windows-specific ntpd bugs and 
platform-independent ntpdate bugs. A logging bugfix has been applied
to the ONCORE driver.

The "dynamic" keyword and is now obsolete and deferred binding to local 
interfaces is the new default. The minimum time restriction for the 
interface update interval has been dropped. 

A number of minor build system and documentation fixes are included. 

This is a recommended upgrade for Windows.

bugs in ntpdc, avoids SIGIO interrupting malloc(), cleans up file descriptor
shutdown in the parse refclock driver, removes some lint from the code,
stops accessing certain buffers immediately after they were freed, fixes
a problem with non-command-line specification of -6, and allows the loopback
interface to share addresses with other interfaces.

This is a recommended upgrade for Windows.

---
NTP 4.2.4p2 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2007/06/19)

Focus: Minor Bugfixes

This release fixes a multicast mode authentication problem, 
an error in NTP packet handling on Windows that could lead to 
ntpd crashing, and several other minor bugs. Handling of 
multicast interfaces and logging configuration were improved. 
The required versions of autogen and libopts were incremented.
This is a recommended upgrade for Windows and multicast users.

---
NTP 4.2.4 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2006/12/31)

Focus: enhancements and bug fixes.

Dynamic interface rescanning was added to simplify the use of ntpd in 
conjunction with DHCP. GNU AutoGen is used for its command-line options 
processing. Separate PPS devices are supported for PARSE refclocks, MD5 
signatures are now provided for the release files. Drivers have been 
added for some new ref-clocks and have been removed for some older 
ref-clocks. This release also includes other improvements, documentation 
and bug fixes. 

K&R C is no longer supported as of NTP-4.2.4. We are now aiming for ANSI 
C support.
