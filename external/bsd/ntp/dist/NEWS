NTP 4.2.8p4

Focus: Security, Bug fies, enhancements.

Severity: MEDIUM

In addition to bug fixes and enhancements, this release fixes the
following 13 low- and medium-severity vulnerabilities:

* Incomplete vallen (value length) checks in ntp_crypto.c, leading
  to potential crashes or potential code injection/information leakage.

    References: Sec 2899, Sec 2671, CVE-2015-7691, CVE-2015-7692, CVE-2015-7702
    Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p4,
    	and 4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.77
    CVSS: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:M/C:N/I:N/A:C) Base Score: 4.6
    Summary: The fix for CVE-2014-9750 was incomplete in that there were
    	certain code paths where a packet with particular autokey operations
	that contained malicious data was not always being completely
	validated. Receipt of these packets can cause ntpd to crash.
    Mitigation:
        Don't use autokey.
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p4, or later, from the NTP Project Download
	    Page or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page
	Monitor your ntpd instances.

* Clients that receive a KoD should validate the origin timestamp field.

    References: Sec 2901 / CVE-2015-7704, CVE-2015-7705
    Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p4,
	and 4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.77
    CVSS: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) Base Score: 4.3-5.0 at worst
    Summary: An ntpd client that honors Kiss-of-Death responses will honor
    	KoD messages that have been forged by an attacker, causing it to
	delay or stop querying its servers for time updates. Also, an
	attacker can forge packets that claim to be from the target and
	send them to servers often enough that a server that implements
	KoD rate limiting will send the target machine a KoD response to
	attempt to reduce the rate of incoming packets, or it may also
	trigger a firewall block at the server for packets from the target
	machine. For either of these attacks to succeed, the attacker must
	know what servers the target is communicating with. An attacker
	can be anywhere on the Internet and can frequently learn the
	identity of the target's time source by sending the target a
	time query.
    Mitigation:
        Implement BCP-38.
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p4, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page
	    or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page
	If you can't upgrade, restrict who can query ntpd to learn who
	    its servers are, and what IPs are allowed to ask your system
	    for the time. This mitigation is heavy-handed.
	Monitor your ntpd instances. 
    Note:
    	4.2.8p4 protects against the first attack. For the second attack,
    	all we can do is warn when it is happening, which we do in 4.2.8p4.

    	Issac E. Cohen, and Sharon Goldberg of Boston University. 

* configuration directives to change "pidfile" and "driftfile" should
  only be allowed locally. 

  References: Sec 2902 / CVE-2015-5196
  Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p4,
	and 4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.77
   CVSS: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:M/C:N/I:C/A:C) Base Score: 6.2 worst case
   Summary: If ntpd is configured to allow for remote configuration,
	and if the (possibly spoofed) source IP address is allowed to
	send remote configuration requests, and if the attacker knows
	the remote configuration password, it's possible for an attacker
	to use the "pidfile" or "driftfile" directives to potentially
	overwrite other files.
   Mitigation:
	Implement BCP-38.
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p4, or later, from the NTP Project Download
	    Page or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page
	If you cannot upgrade, don't enable remote configuration.
	If you must enable remote configuration and cannot upgrade,
	    remote configuration of NTF's ntpd requires:
	    - an explicitly configured trustedkey, and you should also
	    	configure a controlkey.
	    - access from a permitted IP. You choose the IPs.
	    - authentication. Don't disable it. Practice secure key safety. 
	Monitor your ntpd instances.

* Slow memory leak in CRYPTO_ASSOC 

  References: Sec 2909 / CVE-2015-7701
  Affects: All ntp-4 releases that use autokey up to, but not
    including 4.2.8p4, and 4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.77
  CVSS: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:M/C:N/I:N/A:C) Base Score: 0.0 best/usual case,
  	4.6 otherwise
  Summary: If ntpd is configured to use autokey, then an attacker can
	send packets to ntpd that will, after several days of ongoing
	attack, cause it to run out of memory.
  Mitigation:
	Don't use autokey.
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p4, or later, from the NTP Project Download
	    Page or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page
	Monitor your ntpd instances.

* mode 7 loop counter underrun

  References:  Sec 2913 / CVE-2015-7848 / TALOS-CAN-0052
  Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p4,
  	and 4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.77
  CVSS: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:M/C:N/I:N/A:C) Base Score: 4.6
  Summary: If ntpd is configured to enable mode 7 packets, and if the
	use of mode 7 packets is not properly protected thru the use of
	the available mode 7 authentication and restriction mechanisms,
	and if the (possibly spoofed) source IP address is allowed to
	send mode 7 queries, then an attacker can send a crafted packet
	to ntpd that will cause it to crash.
  Mitigation:
	Implement BCP-38.
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p4, or later, from the NTP Project Download
	    Page or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.
	      If you are unable to upgrade:
	In ntp-4.2.8, mode 7 is disabled by default. Don't enable it.
	If you must enable mode 7:
	    configure the use of a requestkey to control who can issue
		mode 7 requests.
	    configure restrict noquery to further limit mode 7 requests
		to trusted sources. 
	Monitor your ntpd instances.

* memory corruption in password store

  References: Sec 2916 / CVE-2015-7849 / TALOS-CAN-0054
  Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p4, and 4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.77
  CVSS: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:M/C:N/I:C/A:C) Base Score: 6.8, worst case
  Summary: If ntpd is configured to allow remote configuration, and if
	the (possibly spoofed) source IP address is allowed to send
	remote configuration requests, and if the attacker knows the
	remote configuration password or if ntpd was configured to
	disable authentication, then an attacker can send a set of
	packets to ntpd that may cause a crash or theoretically
	perform a code injection attack.
  Mitigation:
	Implement BCP-38.
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p4, or later, from the NTP Project Download
	    Page or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.
	If you are unable to upgrade, remote configuration of NTF's
	    ntpd requires:
		an explicitly configured "trusted" key. Only configure
			this if you need it.
		access from a permitted IP address. You choose the IPs.
		authentication. Don't disable it. Practice secure key safety. 
	Monitor your ntpd instances.

* Infinite loop if extended logging enabled and the logfile and
  keyfile are the same.

    References: Sec 2917 / CVE-2015-7850 / TALOS-CAN-0055
    Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p4,
	and 4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.77
    CVSS: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:M/C:N/I:N/A:C) Base Score: 4.6, worst case
    Summary: If ntpd is configured to allow remote configuration, and if
	the (possibly spoofed) source IP address is allowed to send
	remote configuration requests, and if the attacker knows the
	remote configuration password or if ntpd was configured to
	disable authentication, then an attacker can send a set of
	packets to ntpd that will cause it to crash and/or create a
	potentially huge log file. Specifically, the attacker could
	enable extended logging, point the key file at the log file,
	and cause what amounts to an infinite loop.
    Mitigation:
	Implement BCP-38.
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p4, or later, from the NTP Project Download
	    Page or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.
	If you are unable to upgrade, remote configuration of NTF's ntpd
	  requires:
            an explicitly configured "trusted" key. Only configure this
	    	if you need it.
            access from a permitted IP address. You choose the IPs.
            authentication. Don't disable it. Practice secure key safety.

* Potential path traversal vulnerability in the config file saving of
  ntpd on VMS.

  References: Sec 2918 / CVE-2015-7851 / TALOS-CAN-0062
  Affects: All ntp-4 releases running under VMS up to, but not
	including 4.2.8p4, and 4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.77
  CVSS: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:M/C:N/I:P/A:C) Base Score: 5.2, worst case
  Summary: If ntpd is configured to allow remote configuration, and if
	the (possibly spoofed) IP address is allowed to send remote
	configuration requests, and if the attacker knows the remote
	configuration password or if ntpd was configured to disable
	authentication, then an attacker can send a set of packets to
	ntpd that may cause ntpd to overwrite files.
  Mitigation:
	Implement BCP-38.
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p4, or later, from the NTP Project Download
	    Page or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.
	If you are unable to upgrade, remote configuration of NTF's ntpd

* ntpq atoascii() potential memory corruption

  References: Sec 2919 / CVE-2015-7852 / TALOS-CAN-0063
  Affects: All ntp-4 releases running up to, but not including 4.2.8p4,
	and 4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.77
  CVSS: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P) Base Score: 4.0, worst case
  Summary: If an attacker can figure out the precise moment that ntpq
	is listening for data and the port number it is listening on or
	if the attacker can provide a malicious instance ntpd that
	victims will connect to then an attacker can send a set of
	crafted mode 6 response packets that, if received by ntpq,
	can cause ntpq to crash.
  Mitigation:
	Implement BCP-38.
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p4, or later, from the NTP Project Download
	    Page or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.
	If you are unable to upgrade and you run ntpq against a server
	    and ntpq crashes, try again using raw mode. Build or get a
	    patched ntpq and see if that fixes the problem. Report new
	    bugs in ntpq or abusive servers appropriately.
	If you use ntpq in scripts, make sure ntpq does what you expect
	    in your scripts.

  	Aleksander Nikolich of Cisco Talos. 

* Invalid length data provided by a custom refclock driver could cause
  a buffer overflow. 

  References: Sec 2920 / CVE-2015-7853 / TALOS-CAN-0064
  Affects: Potentially all ntp-4 releases running up to, but not
	including 4.2.8p4, and 4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.77
	that have custom refclocks
  CVSS: (AV:L/AC:H/Au:M/C:C/I:C/A:C) Base Score: 0.0 usual case,
	5.9 unusual worst case
  Summary: A negative value for the datalen parameter will overflow a
	data buffer. NTF's ntpd driver implementations always set this
	value to 0 and are therefore not vulnerable to this weakness.
	If you are running a custom refclock driver in ntpd and that
	driver supplies a negative value for datalen (no custom driver
	of even minimal competence would do this) then ntpd would
	overflow a data buffer. It is even hypothetically possible
	in this case that instead of simply crashing ntpd the attacker
	could effect a code injection attack.
  Mitigation:
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p4, or later, from the NTP Project Download
	    Page or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.
	If you are unable to upgrade:
		If you are running custom refclock drivers, make sure
			the signed datalen value is either zero or positive. 
	Monitor your ntpd instances.

* Password Length Memory Corruption Vulnerability

  References: Sec 2921 / CVE-2015-7854 / TALOS-CAN-0065
  Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p4, and
  	4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.77
  CVSS: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:M/C:C/I:C/A:C) Base Score: 0.0 best case,
  	1.7 usual case, 6.8, worst case
  Summary: If ntpd is configured to allow remote configuration, and if
	the (possibly spoofed) source IP address is allowed to send
	remote configuration requests, and if the attacker knows the
	remote configuration password or if ntpd was (foolishly)
	configured to disable authentication, then an attacker can
	send a set of packets to ntpd that may cause it to crash,
	with the hypothetical possibility of a small code injection.
  Mitigation:
	Implement BCP-38.
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p4, or later, from the NTP Project Download
	    Page or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.
	If you are unable to upgrade, remote configuration of NTF's
	    ntpd requires:
		an explicitly configured "trusted" key. Only configure
			this if you need it.
		access from a permitted IP address. You choose the IPs.
		authentication. Don't disable it. Practice secure key safety.

* decodenetnum() will ASSERT botch instead of returning FAIL on some
  bogus values.

  References: Sec 2922 / CVE-2015-7855
  Affects: All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p4, and
	4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.77
  CVSS: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:M/C:N/I:N/A:C) Base Score: 4.6, worst case
  Summary: If ntpd is fed a crafted mode 6 or mode 7 packet containing
	an unusually long data value where a network address is expected,
	the decodenetnum() function will abort with an assertion failure
	instead of simply returning a failure condition.
  Mitigation:
	Implement BCP-38.
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p4, or later, from the NTP Project Download
	    Page or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.
	If you are unable to upgrade:
		mode 7 is disabled by default. Don't enable it.
		Use restrict noquery to limit who can send mode 6
			and mode 7 requests.
		Configure and use the controlkey and requestkey
			authentication directives to limit who can
			send mode 6 and mode 7 requests. 
	Monitor your ntpd instances.

* NAK to the Future: Symmetric association authentication bypass via
  crypto-NAK.

  References: Sec 2941 / CVE-2015-7871
  Affects: All ntp-4 releases between 4.2.5p186 up to but not including
  	4.2.8p4, and 4.3.0 up to but not including 4.3.77
  CVSS: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P) Base Score: 6.4
  Summary: Crypto-NAK packets can be used to cause ntpd to accept time
	from unauthenticated ephemeral symmetric peers by bypassing the
	authentication required to mobilize peer associations. This
	vulnerability appears to have been introduced in ntp-4.2.5p186
	when the code handling mobilization of new passive symmetric
	associations (lines 1103-1165) was refactored.
  Mitigation:
	Implement BCP-38.
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p4, or later, from the NTP Project Download
	    Page or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.
	If you are unable to upgrade:
		Apply the patch to the bottom of the "authentic" check
			block around line 1136 of ntp_proto.c. 
	Monitor your ntpd instances.

Backward-Incompatible changes:
* [Bug 2817] Default on Linux is now "rlimit memlock -1".
While the general default of 32M is still the case, under Linux
the default value has been changed to -1 (do not lock ntpd into
  memory).  A value of 0 means "lock ntpd into memory with whatever
  memory it needs." If your ntp.conf file has an explicit "rlimit memlock"
  value in it, that value will continue to be used.

* [Bug 2886] Misspelling: "outlyer" should be "outlier".
  If you've written a script that looks for this case in, say, the
  output of ntpq, you probably want to change your regex matches
  from 'outlyer' to 'outl[iy]er'.

New features in this release:
* 'rlimit memlock' now has finer-grained control.  A value of -1 means
  "don't lock ntpd into memore".  This is the default for Linux boxes.
  A value of 0 means "lock ntpd into memory" with no limits.  Otherwise
  the value is the number of megabytes of memory to lock.  The default
  is 32 megabytes.

* The old Google Test framework has been replaced with a new framework,
  based on http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity/ .

NTP 4.2.8p3 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2015/06/29) 

Focus: 1 Security fix.  Bug fixes and enhancements.  Leap-second improvements.

Severity: MEDIUM

Security Fix:

* [Sec 2853] Crafted remote config packet can crash some versions of
  ntpd.  Aleksis Kauppinen, Juergen Perlinger, Harlan Stenn.

Under specific circumstances an attacker can send a crafted packet to
cause a vulnerable ntpd instance to crash. This requires each of the
following to be true:

1) ntpd set up to allow remote configuration (not allowed by default), and
2) knowledge of the configuration password, and
3) access to a computer entrusted to perform remote configuration. 

This vulnerability is considered low-risk.

New features in this release:

Optional (disabled by default) support to have ntpd provide smeared
leap second time.  A specially built and configured ntpd will only
offer smeared time in response to client packets.  These response
packets will also contain a "refid" of 254.a.b.c, where the 24 bits
of a, b, and c encode the amount of smear in a 2:22 integer:fraction 
format.  See README.leapsmear and http://bugs.ntp.org/2855 for more
information.

   *IF YOU CHOOSE TO CONFIGURE NTPD TO PROVIDE LEAP SMEAR TIME*
   *BE SURE YOU DO NOT OFFER THAT TIME ON PUBLIC TIMESERVERS.*

We've imported the Unity test framework, and have begun converting
the existing google-test items to this new framework.  If you want
to write new tests or change old ones, you'll need to have ruby
installed.  You don't need ruby to run the test suite.

Bug Fixes and Improvements:

* CID 739725: Fix a rare resource leak in libevent/listener.c.
* CID 1295478: Quiet a pedantic potential error from the fix for Bug 2776.

  interface is not usable (e.g., no link).
* [Bug 2794] Clean up kernel clock status reports.
* [Bug 2800] refclock_true.c true_debug() can't open debug log because
  of incompatible open/fdopen parameters.
* [Bug 2804] install-local-data assumes GNU 'find' semantics.

NTP 4.2.8p2 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2015/04/07) 

Focus: Security and Bug fixes, enhancements.

Severity: MEDIUM
 
In addition to bug fixes and enhancements, this release fixes the
following medium-severity vulnerabilities involving private key
authentication:

* [Sec 2779] ntpd accepts unauthenticated packets with symmetric key crypto.

    References: Sec 2779 / CVE-2015-1798 / VU#374268
    Affects: All NTP4 releases starting with ntp-4.2.5p99 up to but not
	including ntp-4.2.8p2 where the installation uses symmetric keys
	to authenticate remote associations.
    CVSS: (AV:A/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) Base Score: 5.4
    Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p2) 07 Apr 2015
    Summary: When ntpd is configured to use a symmetric key to authenticate
	a remote NTP server/peer, it checks if the NTP message
	authentication code (MAC) in received packets is valid, but not if
	there actually is any MAC included. Packets without a MAC are
	accepted as if they had a valid MAC. This allows a MITM attacker to
	send false packets that are accepted by the client/peer without
	having to know the symmetric key. The attacker needs to know the
	transmit timestamp of the client to match it in the forged reply
	and the false reply needs to reach the client before the genuine
	reply from the server. The attacker doesn't necessarily need to be
	relaying the packets between the client and the server.

	Authentication using autokey doesn't have this problem as there is
	a check that requires the key ID to be larger than NTP_MAXKEY,
	which fails for packets without a MAC.
    Mitigation:
        Upgrade to 4.2.8p2, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page
	or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page
        Configure ntpd with enough time sources and monitor it properly. 
    Credit: This issue was discovered by Miroslav Lichvar, of Red Hat. 

* [Sec 2781] Authentication doesn't protect symmetric associations against
  DoS attacks.

    References: Sec 2781 / CVE-2015-1799 / VU#374268
    Affects: All NTP releases starting with at least xntp3.3wy up to but
	not including ntp-4.2.8p2 where the installation uses symmetric
	key authentication.
    CVSS: (AV:A/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) Base Score: 5.4
    Note: the CVSS base Score for this issue could be 4.3 or lower, and
	it could be higher than 5.4.
    Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p2) 07 Apr 2015
    Summary: An attacker knowing that NTP hosts A and B are peering with
	each other (symmetric association) can send a packet to host A
	with source address of B which will set the NTP state variables
	on A to the values sent by the attacker. Host A will then send
	on its next poll to B a packet with originate timestamp that
	doesn't match the transmit timestamp of B and the packet will
	be dropped. If the attacker does this periodically for both
	hosts, they won't be able to synchronize to each other. This is
	a known denial-of-service attack, described at
	https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/onwire.html .

	According to the document the NTP authentication is supposed to
	protect symmetric associations against this attack, but that
	doesn't seem to be the case. The state variables are updated even
	when authentication fails and the peers are sending packets with
	originate timestamps that don't match the transmit timestamps on
	the receiving side.

	This seems to be a very old problem, dating back to at least
	xntp3.3wy. It's also in the NTPv3 (RFC 1305) and NTPv4 (RFC 5905)
	specifications, so other NTP implementations with support for
	symmetric associations and authentication may be vulnerable too.
	An update to the NTP RFC to correct this error is in-process.
    Mitigation:
        Upgrade to 4.2.8p2, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page
	or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page
        Note that for users of autokey, this specific style of MITM attack
	is simply a long-known potential problem.
        Configure ntpd with appropriate time sources and monitor ntpd.
	Alert your staff if problems are detected. 
    Credit: This issue was discovered by Miroslav Lichvar, of Red Hat. 

* New script: update-leap
The update-leap script will verify and if necessary, update the
leap-second definition file.
It requires the following commands in order to work:

	wget logger tr sed shasum

Some may choose to run this from cron.  It needs more portability testing.

Bug Fixes and Improvements:

* [Bug 1787] DCF77's formerly "antenna" bit is "call bit" since 2003.
* [Bug 1960] setsockopt IPV6_MULTICAST_IF: Invalid argument.

NTP 4.2.8p1 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2015/02/04) 

Focus: Security and Bug fixes, enhancements.

Severity: HIGH
 
In addition to bug fixes and enhancements, this release fixes the
following high-severity vulnerabilities:

* vallen is not validated in several places in ntp_crypto.c, leading
  to a potential information leak or possibly a crash

    References: Sec 2671 / CVE-2014-9297 / VU#852879
    Affects: All NTP4 releases before 4.2.8p1 that are running autokey.
    CVSS: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) Base Score: 7.5
    Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p1) 04 Feb 2015
    Summary: The vallen packet value is not validated in several code
             paths in ntp_crypto.c which can lead to information leakage
	     or perhaps a crash of the ntpd process.
    Mitigation - any of:
	Upgrade to 4.2.8p1, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page
		or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.
	Disable Autokey Authentication by removing, or commenting out,
		all configuration directives beginning with the "crypto"
		keyword in your ntp.conf file. 
    Credit: This vulnerability was discovered by Stephen Roettger of the
    	Google Security Team, with additional cases found by Sebastian
	Krahmer of the SUSE Security Team and Harlan Stenn of Network
	Time Foundation. 

* ::1 can be spoofed on some OSes, so ACLs based on IPv6 ::1 addresses
  can be bypassed.

    References: Sec 2672 / CVE-2014-9298 / VU#852879
    Affects: All NTP4 releases before 4.2.8p1, under at least some
	versions of MacOS and Linux. *BSD has not been seen to be vulnerable.
    CVSS: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C) Base Score: 9
    Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p1) 04 Feb 2014
    Summary: While available kernels will prevent 127.0.0.1 addresses
	from "appearing" on non-localhost IPv4 interfaces, some kernels
	do not offer the same protection for ::1 source addresses on
	IPv6 interfaces. Since NTP's access control is based on source
	address and localhost addresses generally have no restrictions,
	an attacker can send malicious control and configuration packets
	by spoofing ::1 addresses from the outside. Note Well: This is
	not really a bug in NTP, it's a problem with some OSes. If you
	have one of these OSes where ::1 can be spoofed, ALL ::1 -based
	ACL restrictions on any application can be bypassed!
    Mitigation:
        Upgrade to 4.2.8p1, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page
	or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page
        Install firewall rules to block packets claiming to come from
	::1 from inappropriate network interfaces.

	the Google Security Team. 

Additionally, over 30 bugfixes and improvements were made to the codebase.

NTP 4.2.8 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2014/12/18) 
 
Focus: Security and Bug fixes, enhancements.
 
Severity: HIGH
 
In addition to bug fixes and enhancements, this release fixes the
following high-severity vulnerabilities:

************************** vv NOTE WELL vv *****************************

The vulnerabilities listed below can be significantly mitigated by
following the BCP of putting

 restrict default ... noquery

in the ntp.conf file.  With the exception of:

   receive(): missing return on error
   References: Sec 2670 / CVE-2014-9296 / VU#852879

below (which is a limited-risk vulnerability), none of the recent
vulnerabilities listed below can be exploited if the source IP is
restricted from sending a 'query'-class packet by your ntp.conf file.

************************** ^^ NOTE WELL ^^ *****************************

* Weak default key in config_auth().

  References: [Sec 2665] / CVE-2014-9293 / VU#852879
  CVSS: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:M/C:P/I:P/A:C) Base Score: 7.3
  Vulnerable Versions: all releases prior to 4.2.7p11
  Date Resolved: 28 Jan 2010

  Summary: If no 'auth' key is set in the configuration file, ntpd
	would generate a random key on the fly.  There were two
	problems with this: 1) the generated key was 31 bits in size,
	and 2) it used the (now weak) ntp_random() function, which was
	seeded with a 32-bit value and could only provide 32 bits of
	entropy.  This was sufficient back in the late 1990s when the
	code was written.  Not today.

  Mitigation - any of:
	- Upgrade to 4.2.7p11 or later.
	- Follow BCP and put 'restrict ... noquery' in your ntp.conf file.

  Summary: Prior to ntp-4.2.7p230 ntp-keygen used a weak seed to
  	prepare a random number generator that was of good quality back
	in the late 1990s. The random numbers produced was then used to
	generate symmetric keys. In ntp-4.2.8 we use a current-technology
	cryptographic random number generator, either RAND_bytes from
	OpenSSL, or arc4random(). 

  Mitigation - any of:
  	- Upgrade to 4.2.7p230 or later.
	- Follow BCP and put 'restrict ... noquery' in your ntp.conf file.

New features / changes in this release:

Important Changes

* Internal NTP Era counters

The internal counters that track the "era" (range of years) we are in
rolls over every 136 years'.  The current "era" started at the stroke of
midnight on 1 Jan 1900, and ends just before the stroke of midnight on
1 Jan 2036.
In the past, we have used the "midpoint" of the  range to decide which
era we were in.  Given the longevity of some products, it became clear
that it would be more functional to "look back" less, and "look forward"
more.  We now compile a timestamp into the ntpd executable and when we
get a timestamp we us the "built-on" to tell us what era we are in.
This check "looks back" 10 years, and "looks forward" 126 years.

* ntpdc responses disabled by default

Dave Hart writes:

For a long time, ntpq and its mostly text-based mode 6 (control) 
protocol have been preferred over ntpdc and its mode 7 (private 
request) protocol for runtime queries and configuration.  There has 
been a goal of deprecating ntpdc, previously held back by numerous 
capabilities exposed by ntpdc with no ntpq equivalent.  I have been 
adding commands to ntpq to cover these cases, and I believe I've 
covered them all, though I've not compared command-by-command 
recently. 

As I've said previously, the binary mode 7 protocol involves a lot of 
hand-rolled structure layout and byte-swapping code in both ntpd and 
ntpdc which is hard to get right.  As ntpd grows and changes, the 
changes are difficult to expose via ntpdc while maintaining forward 
and backward compatibility between ntpdc and ntpd.  In contrast, 
ntpq's text-based, label=value approach involves more code reuse and 
allows compatible changes without extra work in most cases. 

Mode 7 has always been defined as vendor/implementation-specific while 
mode 6 is described in RFC 1305 and intended to be open to interoperate 
with other implementations.  There is an early draft of an updated 
mode 6 description that likely will join the other NTPv4 RFCs 
eventually. (http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-odonoghue-ntpv4-control-01)

For these reasons, ntpd 4.2.7p230 by default disables processing of 
ntpdc queries, reducing ntpd's attack surface and functionally 
deprecating ntpdc.  If you are in the habit of using ntpdc for certain 
operations, please try the ntpq equivalent.  If there's no equivalent, 
please open a bug report at http://bugs.ntp.org./

In addition to the above, over 1100 issues have been resolved between
the 4.2.6 branch and 4.2.8.  The ChangeLog file in the distribution
lists these.

NTP 4.2.6p5 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2011/12/24) 
 
Focus: Bug fixes
 
Severity: Medium 
 
This is a recommended upgrade. 

This release updates sys_rootdisp and sys_jitter calculations to match the
RFC specification, fixes a potential IPv6 address matching error for the
"nic" and "interface" configuration directives, suppresses the creation of
extraneous ephemeral associations for certain broadcastclient and
multicastclient configurations, cleans up some ntpq display issues, and
includes improvements to orphan mode, minor bugs fixes and code clean-ups.

New features / changes in this release:

ntpd

 * Updated "nic" and "interface" IPv6 address handling to prevent 
   mismatches with localhost [::1] and wildcard [::] which resulted from
   using the address/prefix format (e.g. fe80::/64)
 * Fix orphan mode stratum incorrectly counting to infinity
 * Orphan parent selection metric updated to includes missing ntohl()
 * Non-printable stratum 16 refid no longer sent to ntp
 * Duplicate ephemeral associations suppressed for broadcastclient and
   multicastclient without broadcastdelay
 * Exclude undetermined sys_refid from use in loopback TEST12
 * Exclude MODE_SERVER responses from KoD rate limiting
 * Include root delay in clock_update() sys_rootdisp calculations
 * get_systime() updated to exclude sys_residual offset (which only
   affected bits "below" sys_tick, the precision threshold)
 * sys.peer jitter weighting corrected in sys_jitter calculation

ntpq

 * -n option extended to include the billboard "server" column
 * IPv6 addresses in the local column truncated to prevent overruns

Focus: Bug fixes, portability fixes, and documentation improvements

Severity: Medium

This is a recommended upgrade.

---
NTP 4.2.6 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2009/12/08)

Focus: enhancements and bug fixes.

---
NTP 4.2.4p8 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2009/12/08)

Focus: Security Fixes

Severity: HIGH

This release fixes the following high-severity vulnerability:

* [Sec 1331] DoS with mode 7 packets - CVE-2009-3563.

  See http://support.ntp.org/security for more information.

  NTP mode 7 (MODE_PRIVATE) is used by the ntpdc query and control utility.
  In contrast, ntpq uses NTP mode 6 (MODE_CONTROL), while routine NTP time
  transfers use modes 1 through 5.  Upon receipt of an incorrect mode 7
  request or a mode 7 error response from an address which is not listed
  in a "restrict ... noquery" or "restrict ... ignore" statement, ntpd will
  reply with a mode 7 error response (and log a message).  In this case:

	* If an attacker spoofs the source address of ntpd host A in a
	  mode 7 response packet sent to ntpd host B, both A and B will
	  continuously send each other error responses, for as long as
	  those packets get through.

	* If an attacker spoofs an address of ntpd host A in a mode 7
	  response packet sent to ntpd host A, A will respond to itself
	  endlessly, consuming CPU and logging excessively.

  Credit for finding this vulnerability goes to Robin Park and Dmitri
  Vinokurov of Alcatel-Lucent.

THIS IS A STRONGLY RECOMMENDED UPGRADE.

---
ntpd now syncs to refclocks right away.

Backward-Incompatible changes:

ntpd no longer accepts '-v name' or '-V name' to define internal variables.
Use '--var name' or '--dvar name' instead. (Bug 817)

NTP 4.2.4p7 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2009/05/04)

Focus: Security and Bug Fixes

Severity: HIGH

This release fixes the following high-severity vulnerability:

* [Sec 1151] Remote exploit if autokey is enabled.  CVE-2009-1252

  See http://support.ntp.org/security for more information.

  If autokey is enabled (if ntp.conf contains a "crypto pw whatever"
  line) then a carefully crafted packet sent to the machine will cause
  a buffer overflow and possible execution of injected code, running
  with the privileges of the ntpd process (often root).

  Credit for finding this vulnerability goes to Chris Ries of CMU.

This release fixes the following low-severity vulnerabilities:

* [Sec 1144] limited (two byte) buffer overflow in ntpq.  CVE-2009-0159
  Credit for finding this vulnerability goes to Geoff Keating of Apple.
  
* [Sec 1149] use SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE on Windows
  Credit for finding this issue goes to Dave Hart.

This release fixes a number of bugs and adds some improvements:

* Improved logging
* Fix many compiler warnings
* Many fixes and improvements for Windows
* Adds support for AIX 6.1
* Resolves some issues under MacOS X and Solaris

THIS IS A STRONGLY RECOMMENDED UPGRADE.

NTP 4.2.4p6 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2009/01/07)

Focus: Security Fix

Severity: Low

This release fixes oCERT.org's CVE-2009-0021, a vulnerability affecting
the OpenSSL library relating to the incorrect checking of the return
value of EVP_VerifyFinal function.

Credit for finding this issue goes to the Google Security Team for
finding the original issue with OpenSSL, and to ocert.org for finding
the problem in NTP and telling us about it.

This is a recommended upgrade.

NTP 4.2.4p5 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2008/08/17)

Focus: Minor Bugfixes 

This release fixes a number of Windows-specific ntpd bugs and 
platform-independent ntpdate bugs. A logging bugfix has been applied
to the ONCORE driver.

The "dynamic" keyword and is now obsolete and deferred binding to local 
interfaces is the new default. The minimum time restriction for the 
interface update interval has been dropped. 

A number of minor build system and documentation fixes are included. 

This is a recommended upgrade for Windows.

bugs in ntpdc, avoids SIGIO interrupting malloc(), cleans up file descriptor
shutdown in the parse refclock driver, removes some lint from the code,
stops accessing certain buffers immediately after they were freed, fixes
a problem with non-command-line specification of -6, and allows the loopback
interface to share addresses with other interfaces.

NTP 4.2.4p3 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2007/06/29)

Focus: Minor Bugfixes

This release fixes a bug in Windows that made it difficult to
terminate ntpd under windows.
This is a recommended upgrade for Windows.

---
NTP 4.2.4p2 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2007/06/19)

Focus: Minor Bugfixes

This release fixes a multicast mode authentication problem, 
an error in NTP packet handling on Windows that could lead to 
ntpd crashing, and several other minor bugs. Handling of 
multicast interfaces and logging configuration were improved. 
The required versions of autogen and libopts were incremented.
This is a recommended upgrade for Windows and multicast users.

---
NTP 4.2.4 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2006/12/31)

Focus: enhancements and bug fixes.

Dynamic interface rescanning was added to simplify the use of ntpd in 
conjunction with DHCP. GNU AutoGen is used for its command-line options 
processing. Separate PPS devices are supported for PARSE refclocks, MD5 
signatures are now provided for the release files. Drivers have been 
added for some new ref-clocks and have been removed for some older 
ref-clocks. This release also includes other improvements, documentation 
and bug fixes. 

K&R C is no longer supported as of NTP-4.2.4. We are now aiming for ANSI 
C support.
