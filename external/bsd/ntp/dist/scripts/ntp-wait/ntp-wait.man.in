ntp-wait \- Wait for ntpd to stabilize the system clock
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ntp-wait
.\" Mixture of short (flag) options and long options
.RB [ \-\fIflag\fP " [\fIvalue\fP]]... [" \-\-\fIopt\-name\fP "[[=| ]\fIvalue\fP]]..."
.PP
All arguments must be options.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B 
will send at most
Inum-triesR
queries to
.Xr ntpd 8 ,
sleeping for
Isecs-between-triesR
after each status return that says
.Xr ntpd 8
has not yet produced a synchronized and stable system clock.
.PP
.B 
will do this quietly, unless the
 v
flag is provided.
.SH "OPTIONS"

.BR  \-n " \fInum\-tries\fP, " \-\- "=" \fInum\-tries\fP
Number of times to check ntpd.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The default \fInum\-tries\fP for this option is:
.ti +4
 100
.sp
The maximum number of times we will check \fBntpd\fP to see if
it has been able to synchronize and stabilize the system clock.
.TP
.BR  \-s " \fIsecs\-between\-tries\fP, " \-\- "=" \fIsecs\-between\-tries\fP
How long to sleep between tries.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The default \fIsecs\-between\-tries\fP for this option is:
.ti +4
 6
.sp
We will sleep for \fIsecs-between-tries\fP after each query
of \fBntpd\fP that returns "the time is not yet stable".
.TP
.BR  \-v ", " \-\-

.sp
By default, \fBntp-wait\fP is silent.

.TP
.BR \-! , " \-\-more-help"
