The
.Nm
utility program is used to query NTP servers which
implement the standard NTP mode 6 control message formats defined
in Appendix B of the NTPv3 specification RFC1305, requesting
information about current state and/or changes in that state.
The same formats are used in NTPv4, although some of the
variables have changed and new ones added. The description on this
page is for the NTPv4 variables.
The program may be run either in interactive mode or controlled using
command line arguments.
Requests to read and write arbitrary
variables can be assembled, with raw and pretty-printed output
options being available.
The
.Nm
utility can also obtain and print a
list of peers in a common format by sending multiple queries to the
server.

If one or more request options is included on the command line
when
.Nm
is executed, each of the requests will be sent
to the NTP servers running on each of the hosts given as command
line arguments, or on localhost by default.
If no request options
are given,
.Nm
will attempt to read commands from the
standard input and execute these on the NTP server running on the
first host given on the command line, again defaulting to localhost
when no other host is specified.
The
.Nm
utility will prompt for
commands if the standard input is a terminal device.

.Nm
uses NTP mode 6 packets to communicate with the
NTP server, and hence can be used to query any compatible server on
the network which permits it.
Note that since NTP is a UDP protocol
this communication will be somewhat unreliable, especially over
large distances in terms of network topology.
The
.Nm
utility makes
one attempt to retransmit requests, and will time requests out if
the remote host is not heard from within a suitable timeout
time.

Specifying a
command line option other than
.Fl i
or
.Fl n
will
cause the specified query (queries) to be sent to the indicated
host(s) immediately.
Otherwise,
.Nm
will attempt to read
interactive format commands from the standard input.
.Ss "Internal Commands"
Interactive format commands consist of a keyword followed by zero
to four arguments.
Only enough characters of the full keyword to
uniquely identify the command need be typed.

A
number of interactive format commands are executed entirely within
the
.Nm
utility itself and do not result in NTP mode 6
requests being sent to a server.
These are described following.
.Bl -tag -width "? [command_keyword]" -compact -offset indent
.It Ic ? Op  Ar command_keyword
.It Ic help Op Ar command_keyword
A
.Ql \&?
by itself will print a list of all the command
keywords known to this incarnation of
.Nm .
A
.Ql \&?
followed by a command keyword will print function and usage
information about the command.
This command is probably a better
source of information about
.Nm
than this manual
page.
.It Ic addvars Ar variable_name Ns Xo Op Ic =value
.Ic ...
.Xc
.It Ic rmvars Ar variable_name Ic ...
.It Ic clearvars
.It Ic showvars
The data carried by NTP mode 6 messages consists of a list of
items of the form
.Ql variable_name=value ,
where the
.Ql =value
is ignored, and can be omitted,
in requests to the server to read variables.
The
.Nm
utility maintains an internal list in which data to be included in control
messages can be assembled, and sent using the
.Ic readlist
and
.Ic writelist
commands described below.
The
.Ic addvars
command allows variables and their optional values to be added to
the list.
If more than one variable is to be added, the list should
be comma-separated and not contain white space.
The
.Ic rmvars
command can be used to remove individual variables from the list,
while the
.Ic clearlist
command removes all variables from the
list.
The
.Ic showvars
command displays the current list of optional variables.
.It Ic authenticate Op yes | no
Normally
.Nm
does not authenticate requests unless
they are write requests.
The command
.Ql authenticate yes
causes
.Nm
to send authentication with all requests it
makes.
Authenticated requests causes some servers to handle
requests slightly differently, and can occasionally melt the CPU in
fuzzballs if you turn authentication on before doing a
.Ic peer
display.
The command
.Ql authenticate
causes
.Nm
to display whether or not
.Nm
is currently autheinticating requests.
.It Ic cooked
Causes output from query commands to be "cooked", so that
variables which are recognized by
.Nm
will have their
values reformatted for human consumption.
Variables which
.Nm
thinks should have a decodable value but didn't are
marked with a trailing
.Ql \&? .
.It Xo
.Ic debug
.Oo
.Cm more |
.Cm less |
.Cm off
.Oc
.Xc
With no argument, displays the current debug level.
Otherwise, the debug level is changed to the indicated level.
.It Ic delay Ar milliseconds
Specify a time interval to be added to timestamps included in
requests which require authentication.
This is used to enable
(unreliable) server reconfiguration over long delay network paths
or between machines whose clocks are unsynchronized.
Actually the
server does not now require timestamps in authenticated requests,
so this command may be obsolete.
.It Ic exit
Exit
.Nm .
.It Ic host Ar hostname
Set the host to which future queries will be sent.
.Ar hostname
may be either a host name or a numeric address.
.It Ic hostnames Op Cm yes | Cm no
If
.Cm yes
is specified, host names are printed in
information displays.
If
.Cm no
is specified, numeric
addresses are printed instead.
The default is
.Cm yes ,
unless
modified using the command line
.Fl n
switch.
.It Ic keyid Ar keyid
This command allows the specification of a key number to be
used to authenticate configuration requests.
This must correspond
to the
.Cm controlkey
key number the server has been configured to use for this
purpose.
.It Ic keytype Xo Oo
.Cm md5 |
.Cm OpenSSLDigestType
.Oc
.Xc
Specify the type of key to use for authenticating requests.
.Cm md5
is alway supported.
If
.Nm
was built with OpenSSL support,
any digest type supported by OpenSSL can also be provided.
If no argument is given, the current
.Ic keytype
is displayed.
.It Ic ntpversion Xo Oo
.Cm 1 |
.Cm 2 |
.Cm 3 |
.Cm 4
.Oc
.Xc
Sets the NTP version number which
.Nm
claims in
packets.
Defaults to 3, and note that mode 6 control messages (and
modes, for that matter) didn't exist in NTP version 1.
There appear
to be no servers left which demand version 1.
With no argument, displays the current NTP version that will be used
when communicating with servers.
.It Ic passwd
This command prompts you to type in a password (which will not
be echoed) which will be used to authenticate configuration
requests.
The password must correspond to the key configured for
use by the NTP server for this purpose if such requests are to be
successful.
.\" Not yet implemented.
.\" .It Ic poll
.\" .Op Ar n
.\" .Op Ic verbose
.\" Poll an NTP server in client mode
.\" .Ar n
.\" times.
.It Ic quit
Exit
.Nm .
.It Ic raw
Causes all output from query commands is printed as received
from the remote server.
The only formating/interpretation done on
the data is to transform nonascii data into a printable (but barely
understandable) form.
.It Ic timeout Ar milliseconds
Specify a timeout period for responses to server queries.
The
default is about 5000 milliseconds.
Note that since
.Nm
retries each query once after a timeout, the total waiting time for
a timeout will be twice the timeout value set.
.It Ic version
Print the version of the
.Nm
program.
.El

.Ss "Control Message Commands"
Association IDs are used to identify system, peer and clock variables.
System variables are assigned an association ID of zero and system name space, while each association is assigned a nonzero association ID and peer namespace.
Most control commands send a single mode-6 message to the server and expect a single response message.
The exceptions are the
.Li peers
command, which sends a series of messages,
and the
.Li mreadlist
and
.Li mreadvar
commands, which iterate over a range of associations.
.Bl -tag -width "something" -compact -offset indent

Obtain and print traffic counts collected and maintained by the monitor facility.
With the exception of
.Cm sort Ns = Ns Ar sortorder ,
the options filter the list returned by
.Cm ntpd.
The
.Cm limited
and
.Cm kod
options return only entries representing client addresses from which the last packet received triggered either discarding or a KoD response.
The
.Cm mincount Ns = Ns Ar count
option filters entries representing less than
.Ar count
packets.
The
.Cm laddr Ns = Ns Ar localaddr
option filters entries for packets received on any local address other than
.Ar localaddr .
.Cm resany Ns = Ns Ar hexmask
and
.Cm resall Ns = Ns Ar hexmask
filter entries containing none or less than all, respectively, of the bits in
.Ar hexmask ,
which must begin with
.Cm 0x .
The
.Ar sortorder
defaults to
.Cm lstint
and may be any of
.Cm addr ,
.Cm count ,
.Cm avgint ,
.Cm lstint ,
or any of those preceded by a minus sign (hyphen) to reverse the sort order.
The output columns are:
.Bl -tag -width "something" -compact -offset indent

If
.Ar assocID
is zero, the variables are from the
.Sx System Variables
name space, otherwise they are from the
.Sx Peer Variables
name space.
The
.Ar assocID

If no
.Ar name
is included, all operative variables in the name space are displayed.

In this case only, if the
.Ar assocID
is omitted, it is assumed zero.
Multiple names are specified with comma separators and without whitespace.
Note that time values are represented in milliseconds
and frequency values in parts-per-million (PPM).
Some NTP timestamps are represented in the format
YYYYMMDDTTTT ,
where YYYY is the year,
MM the month of year,
DD the day of month and
TTTT the time of day.

.El

.Ss Status Words and Kiss Codes

The current state of the operating program is shown
in a set of status words
maintained by the system.
Status information is also available on a per-association basis.
These words are displayed in the
.Ic rv
and
.Ic as
commands both in hexadecimal and in decoded short tip strings.
The codes, tips and short explanations are documented on the
.Lk decode.html "Event Messages and Status Words"
page.
The page also includes a list of system and peer messages,
the code for the latest of which is included in the status word.
.Pp
Information resulting from protocol machine state transitions
is displayed using an informal set of ASCII strings called
.Lk decode.html#kiss "kiss codes" .
The original purpose was for kiss-o'-death (KoD) packets
sent by the server to advise the client of an unusual condition.
They are now displayed, when appropriate,
in the reference identifier field in various billboards.

.Ss System Variables
The following system variables appear in the
.Ic rv
billboard.
