        <h3>Shared Memory Driver</h3>
        <hr>
        <h4>Synopsis</h4>
        <p>Address: 127.127.28.<i>u</i><br>
            Reference ID: <tt>SHM</tt><br>
            Driver ID: <tt>SHM</tt></p>

        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>This driver receives its reference clock info from a shared memory-segment. The shared memory-segment is created with owner-only access for unit 0 and 1, and world access for unit 2 and 3</p>

        <h4>Structure of shared memory-segment</h4>
        <pre>struct shmTime {
        int    mode; /* 0 - if valid is set:
                      *       use values,
                      *       clear valid
                      * 1 - if valid is set:
                      *       if count before and after read of data is equal:
                      *         use values
                      *       clear valid
                      */
        volatile int    count;
        time_t          clockTimeStampSec;
        int             clockTimeStampUSec;
        time_t          receiveTimeStampSec;
        int             receiveTimeStampUSec;
        int             leap;
        int             precision;
        int             nsamples;
        volatile int    valid;
        unsigned        clockTimeStampNSec;     /* Unsigned ns timestamps */
        unsigned        receiveTimeStampNSec;   /* Unsigned ns timestamps */
        int             dummy[8];
};</pre>

        <h4>Operation mode=0</h4>
        <p>Each second, the value of <code>valid</code> of the shared memory-segment is checked:</p>
        <p>If set, the values in the record (clockTimeStampSec, clockTimeStampUSec, receiveTimeStampSec, receiveTimeStampUSec, leap, precision) are passed to ntp, and <code>valid</code> is cleared and <code>count</code> is bumped.</p>
        <p>If not set, <code>count</code> is bumped.</p>
        <h4>Operation mode=1</h4>
        <p>Each second, <code>valid</code> in the shared memory-segment is checked:</p>
        <p>If set, the <code>count</code> field of the record is remembered, and the values in the record (clockTimeStampSec, clockTimeStampUSec, receiveTimeStampSec, receiveTimeStampUSec, leap, precision) are read. Then, the remembered <code>count</code> is compared to current value of <code>count</code> now in the record. If both are equal, the values read from the record are passed to ntp. If they differ, another process has modified the record while it was read out (was not able to produce this case), and failure is reported to ntp. The <code>valid</code> flag is cleared and <code>count</code> is bumped.</p>
        <p>If not set, <code>count</code> is bumped</p>


<h4>gpsd</h4>

<a href="http://gpsd.berlios.de/"><i>gpsd</i></a>
knows how to talk to many GPS devices.
It works with <i>ntpd</i> through the SHM driver.
<P>
The <i>gpsd</i> man page suggests setting minpoll and maxpoll to 4.
That was an attempt to reduce jitter.
The SHM driver was fixed (ntp-4.2.5p138) to collect data each second rather than
once per polling interval so that suggestion is no longer reasonable.
<P>


<h4>Clockstats</h4>
If flag4 is set when the driver is polled, a clockstats record is written.
The first 3 fields are the normal date, time, and IP address common to all clockstats records.
<P>
The 4th field is the number of second ticks since the last poll.
The 5th field is the number of good data samples found.  The last 64 will be used by ntpd.
The 6th field is the number of sample that didn't have valid data ready.
The 7th field is the number of bad samples.
The 8th field is the number of times the the mode 1 info was update while nptd was trying to grab a sample.
<P>
