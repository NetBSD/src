[1mSCOPE[0m
       This document describes the format of the [1mlesskey [22msource file, which is
       used by [1mless [22mversion 582 and later.  In previous versions  of  [1mless[22m,  a
       separate  program called [1mlesskey [22mwas used to compile the [1mlesskey [22msource
       file into a format understood by [1mless[22m.  This  compilation  step  is  no
       longer  required  and  the [1mlesskey [22mprogram is therefore deprecated, al‚Äê
       though the file format remains supported by [1mless [22mitself.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       A [1mlesskey [22mfile specifies a set of key bindings  and  environment  vari‚Äê
       ables to be used by subsequent invocations of [1mless[22m.

[1mFILE FORMAT[0m
       The  input  file consists of one or more [4msections[24m.  Each section starts
       with a line that identifies the type  of  section.   Possible  sections
       are:

       #command
              Customizes command key bindings.

       #line-edit
              Customizes line-editing key bindings.

       #env   Defines environment variables.

       Blank lines and lines which start with a hash mark (#) are ignored, ex‚Äê
       cept as noted below.

[1mCOMMAND SECTION[0m
       The command section begins with the line

       #command

       If the command section is the first section in the file, this line  may
       be omitted.  The command section consists of lines of the form:

            [4mstring[24m <whitespace> [4maction[24m [extra-string] <newline>

       Whitespace  is  any  sequence  of  one or more spaces and/or tabs.  The
       [4mstring[24m is the command key(s) which invoke the action.  The  [4mstring[24m  may
       be a single command key, or a sequence of up to 15 keys.  The [4maction[24m is
       the name of the less action, from the list below.   The  characters  in
       the  [4mstring[24m may appear literally, or be prefixed by a caret to indicate
       a control key.  A backslash followed by one to three octal  digits  may
       be  used  to  specify a character by its octal value.  A backslash fol‚Äê
       lowed by certain characters specifies input characters as follows:

            \b   BACKSPACE   (0x08)
            \e   ESCAPE      (0x1B)
            \n   NEWLINE     (0x0A)
            \r   RETURN      (0x0D)
            \t   TAB         (0x09)

            \k followed by a single character represents the char(s)  produced
            when one of these keys is pressed:

            \kb   BACKSPACE (the BACKSPACE key)
            \kB   ctrl-BACKSPACE
            \kd   DOWN ARROW
            \kD   PAGE DOWN
            \ke   END
            \kh   HOME
            \ki   INSERT
            \kl   LEFT ARROW
            \kL   ctrl-LEFT ARROW
            \kr   RIGHT ARROW
            \kR   ctrl-RIGHT ARROW
            \kt   BACKTAB
            \ku   UP ARROW
            \kU   PAGE UP
            \kx   DELETE
            \kX   ctrl-DELETE
            \k1   F1


            A backslash followed by any other character indicates that charac‚Äê
            ter is to be taken literally.  Characters which must  be  preceded
            by  backslash  include  caret, space, tab, hash mark and the back‚Äê
            slash itself.

            An action may be followed by an "extra" string.  When such a  com‚Äê
            mand  is  entered while running [1mless[22m, the action is performed, and
            then the extra string is parsed, just as if it were  typed  in  to
            [1mless[22m.   This  feature  can  be used in certain cases to extend the
            functionality of a command.  For example, see  the  "{"  and  ":t"
            commands  in  the  example  below.  The extra string has a special
            meaning for the "quit" action: when [1mless [22mquits, the first  charac‚Äê
            ter of the extra string is used as its exit status.

[1mEXAMPLE[0m
       The following input file describes the set of default command keys used
       by [1mless[22m.  Documentation on each command can be found in the  man  page,
       under the key sequence which invokes the command.

[1mPRECEDENCE[0m
       Commands  specified  by  [1mlesskey  [22mtake precedence over the default com‚Äê
       mands.  A default command key may be disabled by including  it  in  the
       input  file with the action "invalid".  Alternatively, a key may be de‚Äê
       fined to do nothing by using the action "noaction".  "noaction" is sim‚Äê
       ilar  to  "invalid",  but [1mless [22mwill give an error beep for an "invalid"
       command, but not for a "noaction" command.  In  addition,  ALL  default
       commands may be disabled by adding this control line to the input file:

       #stop

       This  will  cause  all  default commands to be ignored.  The #stop line
       should be the last line in that section of the file.

       Be aware that #stop can be dangerous.  Since all default  commands  are
       disabled, you must provide sufficient commands before the #stop line to
       enable all necessary actions.  For example, failure to provide a "quit"
       command can lead to frustration.

[1mLINE EDITING SECTION[0m
       The line-editing section begins with the line:

       #line-edit

       This  section specifies new key bindings for the line editing commands,
       in a manner similar to the way key bindings for ordinary  commands  are
       specified  in  the #command section.  The line-editing section consists
       of a list of keys and actions, one per line as in the example below.

[1mEXAMPLE[0m
       The following input file describes the set of default line-editing keys
       used by [1mless[22m:


            #line-edit

            \17          back-complete
            \e\t         back-complete

            \ex          delete
            \kx          delete
            \eX          word-delete
            \ekx         word-delete

            \e0          home
            \kh          home
            \e$          end
            \ke          end
            \ek          up
            \ku          up
            \ej          down
            ^G           abort


[1mLESS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES[0m
       The environment variable section begins with the line

       #env

       Following  this  line  is  a  list of environment variable assignments.
       Each line consists of an environment variable name, an equals sign  (=)
       and  the value to be assigned to the environment variable.  White space
       before and after the equals sign is  ignored.   Variables  assigned  in
       this  way  are visible only to [1mless[22m.  If a variable is specified in the
       system environment and also in a lesskey file, the value in the lesskey
       file takes precedence.

       If the variable name is followed by += rather than =, the string is ap‚Äê
       pended to the variable's existing value.  This currently works only  if
       any += lines immediately follow the same variable's original definition
       (with an = line), without any intervening definitions  of  other  vari‚Äê
       ables.   It  can append only to a variable defined earlier in the file;
       it cannot append to a variable in the system environment.   The  string
       is appended literally, without any extra whitespace added, so if white‚Äê
       space is desired, it should be appended to the  end  of  the  preceding
       line.   (It  cannot  be added to the beginning of the += string because
       space after the equals sign is ignored, as noted above.)

[1mCONDITIONAL CONFIGURATION[0m
       If a line begins with #version followed by a relational operator and  a
       version  number, the remainder of the line is parsed if and only if the
       running version of [1mless [22m(or [1mlesskey[22m) matches the operator.  This can be
       helpful if a lesskey file is used by different versions of [1mless[22m.

       For  example,  suppose  that  a  new command named 'sideways-search' is
       added in [1mless [22mversion 777.  Then the following line  would  assign  the
       command  to  the  Q key, but only in versions of [1mless [22mwhich support it.
       The line would be ignored by versions earlier than 777.

                 #version >= 777  Q sideways-search

       These six operators are supported:

             >    Greater than
             <    Less than
             >=   Greater than or equal to
             <=   Less than or equal to
             =    Equal to
             !=   Not equal to

       The #version feature is not supported in [1mless [22mand [1mlesskey  [22mbefore  ver‚Äê
       sion 594.  In those older versions, all #version lines are ignored.

[1mEXAMPLE[0m
       The following input file sets the -i and -S options when is run and, on
       version 595 and higher, adds a --color option.

          #env
          ## (Note that there must be a space at the end of the next line,
          ##  to separate the --color option from the -S option.)
          LESS = -i -S
          #version >= 595  LESS += --color=Hkc

[1mSEE ALSO[0m
       [1mless[22m(1)

[1mWARNINGS[0m
       On MS-DOS and OS/2 systems, certain keys send a sequence of  characters
       which  start  with  a  NUL character (0).  This NUL character should be
       represented as \340 in a lesskey file.
