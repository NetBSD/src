Introduction
------------

In DHCP, a unit test exercises a particular piece of code in 
isolation. There is a separate unit test per module or API. Each unit
test lives in a directory beneath the code it is designed to exercise.
So, we have:

    client/tests/
    common/tests/
    dhcpctl/tests/

And so on.

Ideally each function would be invoked with every possible type of
input, and each branch of every function would be checked. In practice
we try to be a bit more pragmatic, and target the most basic
operations, as well tricky code, and areas we have seen bugs in the
past.


Running Unit Tests
------------------

In order to run the unit tests for DHCP, use:

$ make check

This will run all of the unit tests.

You can run a single test by going to the appropriate test directory 
and invoking the test directly:

$ cd common/tests
$ make test_alloc
$ ./test_alloc

There are also a number of options that you can use when running a
test. To see these, use the "-u" flag on the program.


Adding a New Unit Test
----------------------

To add an additional test to an existing test program, you must create
a function for the new test in the C source file:

static void
mynewtest(void) {
	static const char *test_desc = "describe the test";

	t_assert("mynewtest", 1, T_REQUIRED, test_desc);

	/* ... test code ... */ 

	t_result(T_PASS);
}

Then add this function to the T_testlist[] array in the file:

testspec_t T_testlist[] = {
        ...
	{	mynewtest, 	"some new test" },
	{	NULL, 		NULL		}
};

Then you should be able to compile and run your new test.


Adding a New Unit Test Program
------------------------------

To add a new program, such as when a new module is added, you can copy
the "unit_test_sample.c" file (in this directory) to a new name, add
the new file as a target in Makefile.am, and begin adding tests. Do
not forget to add it to CVS via "cvs add".

If there is no "tests" directory for a given subdirectory, then one 
must be created. This can be done by:

1. Creating the directory:
   
    $ mkdir $subdir/tests
    $ cvs add tests

2. Adding the subdirectory to the build system:

    Add to $subdir/Makefile.am:

        SUBDIRS = tests

    Add to the AC_OUTPUT macro in configure.ac:

        $subdir/tests/Makefile

3. Create a Makefile.am in the new directory, something like this:

    AM_CPPFLAGS = -I../..

    check_PROGRAMS = test_foo

    TESTS = test_foo

    test_foo_SOURCES = test_foo.c
    test_foo_LDADD = ../../tests/libt_api.a     # plus others...


See existing Makefile.am for examples, and the Automake documentation:

    http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Tests.html


Support Functions
-----------------

Here are a few of the most useful functions defined in t_api that you
can use in testing:

	void
	t_assert(const char *component, int anum, int class,
		 const char *what, ...);

		The name of this function is slightly misleading. It
		actually just prints out an error message in the test
		output.

	void
	t_info(const char *format, ...);

		Prints out a message in the test output. You should
		include "\n" at the end.

	void
	t_result(int result);

		Prints out the result in the test output. You should
		use one of the constants for this:

			T_PASS
			T_FAIL
			T_UNRESOLVED
			T_UNSUPPORTED
			T_UNTESTED
			T_THREADONLY

Additional Testing
------------------

Other static or runtime testing is always an option. For instance, you
can use valgrind to check for memory leaks.
