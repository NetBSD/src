Introduction
------------

That is only a brief overview of tests in ISC DHCP. For more thorough
description, see ISC DHCP Developer's Guide. You can generate it, by
having Doxygen installed and doing:

 cd doc
 make devel

and then opening doc/html/index.html

Tests Overview
--------------

In DHCP, a unit test exercises a particular piece of code in 
isolation. There is a separate unit test per module or API. Each unit
test lives in a directory beneath the code it is designed to exercise.
So, we (will eventually) have:

    server/tests/
    client/tests/
    common/tests/
    dhcpctl/tests/

And so on.

We are using ATF (Automated Test Framework) as a framework to run our
unittests. See ISC DHCP Developer's Guide for much more thorough
description of unit-test and ATF framework in general.

Running Unit Tests
------------------

In order to run the unit tests for DHCP, enable ATF support during configure:

$ ./configure --with-atf

And then use:

$ make check

This will run all of the unit tests. Make sure that ATF is actually
installed and that you have atf-run and atf-report tool in your PATH.

You can run a single test by going to the appropriate test directory 
and invoking the test directly:

$ cd server/tests
$ atf-run | atf-report

There are also a number of options that you can use when running a
test. See atf-run and atf-report documentation.
