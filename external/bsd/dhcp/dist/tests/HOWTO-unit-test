Introduction
------------

That is only a brief overview of tests in ISC DHCP. For more thorough
description, see ISC DHCP Developer's Guide. You can generate it, by
having Doxygen installed and doing:

 cd doc
 make devel

and then opening doc/html/index.html

Tests Overview
--------------

In DHCP, a unit test exercises a particular piece of code in
isolation. There is a separate unit test per module or API. Each unit
test lives in a directory beneath the code it is designed to exercise.
So, we (will eventually) have:

    server/tests/
    client/tests/
    common/tests/
    dhcpctl/tests/

And so on.

We are using ATF (Automated Test Framework) as a framework to run our
unit tests. See ISC DHCP Developer's Guide for much more thorough
description of unit-test and ATF framework in general.

Installing ATF
--------------
ATF sources can be downloaded from https://github.com/jmmv/kyua. ATF
must be configured, compiled and then installed to be available during
the DHCP configure procedure. Please follow INSTALL file supplied with
ATF sources (it's essentially the typical ./configure && make &&
make install procedure).

Beginning with ATF version 0.16, it is necessary to include the following
options --enable-tools and --disable-shared when configuring ATF:

    configure --prefix=<prefix> --enable-tools --disable-shared

ISC DHCP unittests will run with ATF releases upto 0.19.  Beginning with
ATF 0.20, the tools, atf-run and atf-report required by ISC DHCP, were
deprecated and are no longer included with ATF.

Running Unit Tests
------------------

In order to run the unit tests for DHCP, enable ATF support during configure:

$ ./configure --with-atf{=<atf-path>}

    where <atf-path> is the path into which ATF was installed.  This would
    be same value used for --prefix when ATF was configured (default is
    /usr/local).

And then build ISC_DHCP with:

$ make

Finally build and run unit tests with:

$ make check

This will traverse the source tree running the unit tests in each unit test
subdirectory.  Note that if one or more tests in a unit test subdirectory fail
the make process will stop.  To run all of the tests regardless of outcome,
use:

$ make -k check

You can run a single test by going to the appropriate test directory
and invoking the test directly:

$ cd server/tests
$ make check
