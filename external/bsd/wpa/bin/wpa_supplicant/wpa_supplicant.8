.Sh NAME
.Nm wpa_supplicant
.Nd WPA/802.11i Supplicant for wireless network devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl BdehLqvw
.Op Fl f Ar debug-file
.Fl i Ar ifname
.Fl c Ar config-file
.Op Fl N i Ar ifname Fl c Ar config-file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
is an implementation of the WPA Supplicant component,
i.e., the part that runs in the client stations.
It implements WPA key negotiation with a WPA Authenticator
and EAP authentication with an Authentication Server.
In addition,
.Nm
controls the roaming and IEEE 802.11
authentication/association support
.\" of the
.\" .Xr wlan 4
.\" module
and can be used to configure static WEP keys
based on identified networks.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility
is designed to be a
.Dq daemon
program that runs in the
background and acts as the backend component controlling
the wireless connection.
It supports separate frontend programs such as the
text-based
.Xr wpa_cli 8
program.
.Pp
The following arguments must be specified on the command line:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl i Ar ifname
Use the specified wireless interface.
.It Fl c Ar config-file
Use the settings in the specified configuration file when managing
the wireless interface.
See
.Xr wpa_supplicant.conf 5
for a description of the configuration file syntax and contents.
.Pp
Changes to the configuration file can be reloaded by sending a
.Dv SIGHUP
signal to the
.Nm
process or with the
.Xr wpa_cli 8
utility, using
.Dq Li "wpa_cli reconfigure" .
.El
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl B
Detach from the controlling terminal and run as a daemon process
in the background.
.It Fl d
Enable debugging messages.
If this option is supplied twice, more verbose messages are displayed.
Messages are sent to stdout by default, even when daemonised.
This can be changed with the
.Fl f
flag.
.It Fl e
Use an external IEEE 802.1X Supplicant program and disable the
internal Supplicant.
This option is not normally used.
.It Fl f
Specifies a file to send debug messages to when enabled with the
.Fl d
flag.
.It Fl h
Show help text.
.It Fl K
Include key information in debugging output.
.It Fl L
Display the license for this program on the terminal and exit.
.It Fl N i Ar ifname Fl c Ar config-file ...
Specify an additional interface and configuration file.
If multiple interfaces are specified then
.Nm
will manage them all with a single process.
.It Fl q
Decrease debugging verbosity (i.e., counteract the use of the
.Fl d
flag).
.It Fl v
Display version information on the terminal and exit.
.It Fl w
If the specified interface is not present, wait for it to be
added; e.g.\& a cardbus device to be inserted.
.\" This option is not normally used; instead,
.\" .Xr devd 8
.\" should be configured to launch
.\" .Nm
.\" when a device is created.
