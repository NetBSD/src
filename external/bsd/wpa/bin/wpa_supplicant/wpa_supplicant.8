.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
is an implementation of the WPA Supplicant component,
i.e., the part that runs in the client stations.
It implements WPA key negotiation with a WPA Authenticator
and EAP authentication with an Authentication Server.
In addition,
.Nm
controls the roaming and IEEE 802.11
authentication/association support
.\" of the
.\" .Xr wlan 4
.\" module
and can be used to configure static WEP keys
based on identified networks.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility
is designed to be a
.Dq daemon
program that runs in the
background and acts as the backend component controlling
the wireless connection.
It supports separate frontend programs such as the
text-based
.Xr wpa_cli 8
program.
.Pp
The following arguments must be specified on the command line:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl i Ar ifname
Use the specified wireless interface.
.It Fl c Ar config-file
Use the settings in the specified configuration file when managing
the wireless interface.
See
.Xr wpa_supplicant.conf 5
for a description of the configuration file syntax and contents.
.Pp
Changes to the configuration file can be reloaded by sending a
.Dv SIGHUP
signal to the
.Nm
process or with the
.Xr wpa_cli 8
utility, using
.Dq Li "wpa_cli reconfigure" .
.El
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl B
Detach from the controlling terminal and run as a daemon process
in the background.
.It Fl b Ar br_ifname
Optional bridge interface name.
.It Fl C Ar ctrl
Control interface parameter.
.It Fl D Ar driver
Driver name (can be either bsd or wired)
.It Fl d
Enable debugging messages.
If this option is supplied twice, more verbose messages are displayed.
Messages are sent to stdout by default, even when daemonised.
This can be changed with the
.Fl f
flag.
.It Fl e Ar entropy-file
Specifies a file to store entropy.
.It Fl f Ar debug-file
Specifies a file to send debug messages to when enabled with the
.Fl d
flag.
.It Fl G Ar global-ctrl-group
Global control interface group.
.It Fl g Ar global-ctrl
Global control interface.
.It Fl h
Show help text.
.It Fl I Ar additional-config-file
Additional configuration file.
.It Fl K
Include key information in debugging output.
.It Fl L
Display the license for this program on the terminal and exit.
.It Fl M Oo Fl i Ar matchifname Oc Fl c Ar config-file ...
Matches the interface name using
.Xr fnmatch 3 ,
or all interfaces if
.Fl i
is not specified.
If multiple interfaces are matched then
.Nm
will manage them all with a single process.
.It Fl N i Ar ifname Fl c Ar config-file ...
Specify an additional interface and configuration file.
If multiple interfaces are specified then
.Nm
will manage them all with a single process.
.It Fl O Ar override-ctrl
Override ctrl_interface parameter for new interface.
.It Fl o Ar override-driver
Override driver paramter for new interface.
.It Fl P Ar pidfile
File in which to save the process PID.
.It Fl p Ar parameters
Specify driver parameters.
.It Fl q
Decrease debugging verbosity (i.e., counteract the use of the
.Fl d
flag).
.It Fl s
Send log messages through
.Xr syslog 3
instead of to the terminal.
.It Fl t
Include timestamp in debug messages.
.It Fl v
Display version information on the terminal and exit.
.It Fl W
Wait for a control interface monitor before starting.
