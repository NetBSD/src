	/**
	 * ctrl_interface - Parameters for the control interface
	 *
	 * If this is specified, %wpa_supplicant will open a control interface
	 * that is available for external programs to manage %wpa_supplicant.
	 * The meaning of this string depends on which control interface
	 * mechanism is used. For all cases, the existence of this parameter
	 * in configuration is used to determine whether the control interface
	 * is enabled.
	 *
	 * For UNIX domain sockets (default on Linux and BSD): This is a
	 * directory that will be created for UNIX domain sockets for listening
	 * to requests from external programs (CLI/GUI, etc.) for status
	 * information and configuration. The socket file will be named based
	 * on the interface name, so multiple %wpa_supplicant processes can be
	 * run at the same time if more than one interface is used.
	 * /var/run/wpa_supplicant is the recommended directory for sockets and
	 * by default, wpa_cli will use it when trying to connect with
	 * %wpa_supplicant.
	 *
	 * Access control for the control interface can be configured
	 * by setting the directory to allow only members of a group
	 * to use sockets. This way, it is possible to run
	 * %wpa_supplicant as root (since it needs to change network
	 * configuration and open raw sockets) and still allow GUI/CLI
	 * components to be run as non-root users. However, since the
	 * control interface can be used to change the network
	 * configuration, this access needs to be protected in many
	 * cases. By default, %wpa_supplicant is configured to use gid
	 * 0 (root). If you want to allow non-root users to use the
	 * control interface, add a new group and change this value to
	 * match with that group. Add users that should have control
	 * interface access to this group.
	 *
	 * When configuring both the directory and group, use following format:
	 * DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=wheel
	 * DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=0
	 * (group can be either group name or gid)
	 *
	 * For UDP connections (default on Windows): The value will be ignored.
	 * This variable is just used to select that the control interface is
	 * to be created. The value can be set to, e.g., udp
	 * (ctrl_interface=udp).
	 *
	 * For Windows Named Pipe: This value can be used to set the security
	 * descriptor for controlling access to the control interface. Security
	 * descriptor can be set using Security Descriptor String Format (see
	 * http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/secauthz/security/security_descriptor_string_format.asp).
	 * The descriptor string needs to be prefixed with SDDL=. For example,
	 * ctrl_interface=SDDL=D: would set an empty DACL (which will reject
