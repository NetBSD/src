.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions retrieve information about weak symbols from the
lookup tables in the (SGI-specific)
.Dq ".debug_weaknames"
section.
Information about weak symbols is returned using opaque descriptors
of type
.Vt Dwarf_Weak .
Applications need to use the functions described below to retrieve
the name and offset information contained in these descriptors.
.Pp
Function
.Fn dwarf_get_weaks
retrieves descriptors for all the weak symbols associated with the
DWARF debug context specified by argument
.Fa dbg .
The argument
.Fa weaks
should point to a location that will be set to a pointer to an array
of
.Vt Dwarf_Weak
descriptors.
The argument
.Fa nweaks
should point to a location that will be set to the number of
descriptors returned.
.Pp
Function
.Fn dwarf_weak_cu_offset
returns the offset, relative to the
.Dq ".debug_info"
section, of the compilation unit that contains the debugging
information entry associated with the argument
.Fa weak .
Argument
.Fa cu_offset
should point to a location that will hold the returned offset.
.Pp
Function
.Fn dwarf_weak_die_offset
retrieves the offset, relative to the
.Dq ".debug_info"
section, of the debugging information entry associated with the
argument
.Fa weak ,
and stores it into the location pointed to by the argument
.Fa die_offset .
.Pp
Function
.Fn dwarf_weak_name_offsets
retrieves the name and offsets for the debugging information
entry for argument
.Fa weak .
Argument
.Fa name
should point to a location which will be set to a pointer to a
NUL-terminated string containing the name of the associated debugging
information entry.
Argument
.Fa die_offset
should point to a location which will be set to the offset, relative
to the
.Dq ".debug_info"
section, of the associated debugging information entry.
Argument
.Fa cu_die_offset
should point to a location which will be set to the
offset, relative to the
.Dq ".debug_info"
section, of the first debugging information entry in the compilation
unit associated with argument
.Fa weak .
.Pp
Function
.Fn dwarf_weakname
sets the location pointed to by argument
.Fa name
to a pointer to a NUL-terminated string holding the name of the
debugging information entry associated with the argument
.Fa weak .
.Ss Memory Management
The memory area used for the array of
.Vt Dwarf_Weak
descriptors returned in argument
.Fa weaks
by function
.Fn dwarf_get_weaks
is owned by the
.Lb libdwarf .
Application code should not attempt to directly free this pointer.
Portable code should instead use the function
.Xr dwarf_weaks_dealloc 3
to indicate that the memory area may be freed.
.Pp
The memory area used for the string returned in the
.Fa name
argument to functions
.Fn dwarf_weak_name_offsets
and
.Fn dwarf_weakname
is owned by the
.Lb libdwarf .
Portable code should indicate that the memory area can
be freed using the
.Xr dwarf_dealloc 3
function.
.Ss Error Returns
If argument
.Fa err
is not
.Dv NULL ,
these functions will use it to store error information,
in case of an error.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success, these functions returns
.Dv DW_DLV_OK .
In case of an error, they return
.Dv DW_DLV_ERROR
and set the argument
.Fa err .
.Sh ERRORS
These functions may fail with the following errors:
.Bl -tag -width ".Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT"
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT
One of the arguments
.Va cu_die_offset ,
.Va cu_offset ,
.Va dbg ,
.Va die_offset ,
.Va weak ,
.Va weaks ,
.Va name ,
or
.Va nweaks
was
.Dv NULL .
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_NO_ENTRY
The DWARF debugging context referenced by argument
.Fa dbg
did not contain information about weak symbols.
