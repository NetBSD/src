.In libdwarf.h
.Ft "Dwarf_Unsigned"
.Fo dwarf_add_file_decl

.Sh DESCRIPTION
Function
.Fn dwarf_add_file_decl
adds a source file entry to a producer instance.
.Pp
Argument
.Fa dbg
should reference a DWARF producer instance allocated using
.Xr dwarf_producer_init 3
or
.Xr dwarf_producer_init_b 3 .
.Pp
Argument
.Fa name
should point to a NUL-terminated string containing the name of
the source file.
.Pp
If the file name in argument
.Fa name
is not a fully qualified pathname, argument
.Fa dirndx
should specify the index of the directory where the source file resides.
Otherwise, argument
.Fa dirndx
should be 0.
Valid directory indices are those returned by the function
.Xr dwarf_add_directory_decl 3 .
.Pp
Argument
.Fa mtime
specifies the time when the file was last modified.
.Pp
Argument
.Fa size
specifies the size of the file in bytes.
.Pp
If argument
.Fa err
is not
.Dv NULL ,
it will be used to store error information in case of an error.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success, function
.Fn dwarf_add_file_decl
returns the index value generated for the source file.
In case of an error, function
.Fn dwarf_add_file_decl
returns
.Dv DW_DLV_NOCOUNT
and sets the argument
.Fa err .
.Sh ERRORS
Function
.Fn dwarf_add_file_decl
can fail with:
.Bl -tag -width ".Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT"
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT
Either arguments
.Fa dbg
or
.Fa name
was
.Dv NULL .
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT
