.Sh DESCRIPTION
Function
.Fn dwarf_add_arange_b
adds an address range entry to a producer instance.
.Pp
Argument
.Fa dbg
should reference a DWARF producer instance allocated using
.Xr dwarf_producer_init 3
or
.Xr dwarf_producer_init_b 3 .
.Pp
Argument
.Fa start
specifies the relocatable start address of the address range.
.Pp
Argument
.Fa length
specifies the length of the address range.
.Pp
Argument
.Fa symbol_index
specifies the ELF symbol index of the first symbol to be used for
relocation.
.Pp
Argument
.Fa end_symbol_index
specifies the ELF symbol index of the second symbol to be used for
relocation.
.Bl -bullet
.It
If argument
.Fa end_symbol_index
is not 0, the
.Dv DW_DLC_SYMBOLIC_RELOCATIONS
flag should have been set on the DWARF producer instance.
The address value specified by argument
.Fa start
will be treated as an offset value from the first symbol,
and the argument
.Fa offset_from_end_symbol
should hold an offset value from the second symbol.
Application code can retrieve the relocation entries for the
symbol pair by calling function
.Xr dwarf_get_relocation_info 3 .
The relocation entry for the first symbol will have type
.Dv dwarf_drt_first_of_length_pair
and the relocation entry for the second symbol will have type
.Dv dwarf_drt_second_of_length_pair .
.It
If argument
.Fa end_symbol_index
is 0, argument
.Fa offset_from_end_symbol
will be ignored and only one symbol is used for relocation.
.El
.Pp
If argument
.Fa err
is not
.Dv NULL ,
it will be used to store error information in case of an error.
.Pp
Function
.Fn dwarf_add_arange
is deprecated.
It is similar to function
.Fn dwarf_add_arange_b
except that it cannot handle all possible symbol index values
and supports only one relocation symbol.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success, these functions return a non-zero value.
In case of an error, these functions return 0 and set
the argument
.Fa err .
.Sh ERRORS
These functions can fail with:
.Bl -tag -width ".Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT"
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT
Argument
.Fa dbg
was
.Dv NULL .
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT
Argument
.Fa end_symbol_index
was non-zero, but the flag
.Dv DW_DLC_SYMBOLIC_RELOCATIONS
was not set on the producer instance.
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_MEMORY
An out of memory condition was encountered during the execution of the
function.
