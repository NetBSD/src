.Nm dwarf_get_relocation_info_count
.Nd return the number of relocation arrays
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libdwarf
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libdwarf.h
.Ft int
.Fo dwarf_get_relocation_info_count
.Fa "Dwarf_P_Debug dbg"
.Fa "Dwarf_Unsigned *reloc_cnt"
.Fa "int *drd_buffer_version"
.Fa "Dwarf_Error *err"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Function
.Fn dwarf_get_relocation_info_count
retrieves the total number of relocation arrays generated by a prior
call to
.Xr dwarf_transform_to_disk_form 3 .
.Pp
Argument
.Fa dbg
should reference a DWARF producer instance allocated using
.Xr dwarf_producer_init 3
or
.Xr dwarf_producer_init_b 3 .
The
.Dv DW_DLC_SYMBOLIC_RELOCATIONS
flag should have been set on the producer instance.
.Pp
Argument
.Fa reloc_cnt
should point to a location which will be set to the total number of
relocation arrays generated.
.Pp
Argument
.Fa drd_buffer_version
should point to a location which will be set to the version number
of the relocation structures returned (see the symbol
.Dv DWARF_DRD_BUFFER_VERSION ,
defined in the header file
.In libdwarf.h ) .
.Pp
If argument
.Fa err
is not
.Dv NULL ,
it will be used to store error information in case of an error.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success, function
.Fn dwarf_get_relocation_info_count
returns
.Dv DW_DLV_OK .
It returns
.Dv DW_DLV_NO_ENTRY
if the
.Dv DW_DLC_SYMBOLIC_RELOCATIONS
flag is not set on the producer instance.
In case of an error, function
.Fn dwarf_get_relocation_info_count
returns
.Dv DW_DLV_ERROR
and sets the argument
.Fa err .
.Sh ERRORS
Function
.Fn dwarf_get_relocation_info_count
can fail with:
.Bl -tag -width ".Bq Er DW_DLE_NO_ENTRY"
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT
One of the arguments
.Fa dbg ,
.Fa reloc_cnt
or
.Fa drd_buffer_version
was
.Dv NULL .
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_NO_ENTRY
The
.Dv DW_DLC_SYMBOLIC_RELOCATIONS
flag was not set.
