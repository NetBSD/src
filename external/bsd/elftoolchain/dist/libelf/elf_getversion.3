.In libelf.h
.Ft unsigned int
.Fn elf_getversion "Elf *elf"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Em Important :
The function
.Fn elf_getversion
is an extension to the
.Xr ELF 3
API.
Applications that need to be portable to other implementations of
.Li libelf
should take care not to use this function.
.Pp
The function
.Fn elf_getversion
returns the operating version for the ELF descriptor pointed to by
argument
.Fa elf .
.Pp
This descriptor must have been allocated by a previous call to one of
the functions that return an ELF descriptor, such as
.Xr elf_begin 3 ,
.Xr elf_memory 3 ,
.Xr elf_open 3
and
.Xr elf_openmemory 3 .
The object associated with the descriptor
.Fa elf
should be an ELF object.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The function returns the operating version for the ELF object if
successful or
.Dv EV_NONE
if an error occurred.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
This function is an extension to the
.Xr ELF 3
API set.
.Sh ERRORS
