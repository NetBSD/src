.In libelf.h
.Ft int
.Fn elf_end "Elf *elf"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Function
.Fn elf_end
is used to release the resources associated with an ELF descriptor
pointed to by argument
.Fa elf .
This descriptor must have been allocated by a previous call to

For programming convenience, a
.Dv NULL
value is permitted for argument
.Fa elf .
.Pp
A call to
.Fn elf_end
decrements the activation count for descriptor
.Fa elf
by one.
The resources associated with the descriptor are only released
with its activation count goes to zero.
.Pp
Once function
.Fn elf_end
returns zero, the ELF descriptor
.Fa elf
will no longer be valid and should not be used further.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Function
.Fn elf_end
returns the current value of the ELF descriptor
.Fa elf Ap s
activation count, or zero if argument
