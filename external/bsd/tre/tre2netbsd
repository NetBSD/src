# Rough instructions for importing new tre release from their git repository:
#
#	$ cd /some/where/temporary
#	$ git clone https://github.com/laurikari/tre.git
#	$ sh /usr/src/external/bsd/tre/tre2netbsd tre `pwd`
#	$ cd src/external/bsd/tre/dist
#	$ cvs import src/external/bsd/tre/dist LAURIKARI tre-yyyymmdd
#	>>> if any conflicts, merge, fix and commit them.
#	>>> check out src/external/bsd/tre/dist.
#	$ cd checked-out-directory
#	>>> next step requires autoconf, automake, gettext, and libtool.
#	$ utils/autogen.sh
#	$ ./configure --prefix=/usr --without-alloca
#	>>> merge newly generated files:
#	>>> 	config.h	 into /usr/src/external/bsd/tre/include
#	>>> 	lib/tre-config.h into /usr/src/external/bsd/tre/include
#	>>> 	tre.pc		 into /usr/src/external/bsd/tre/lib
