# byacc2netbsd:  convert a byacc tree into a
# netbsd byacc source tree, under src/external/bsd/byacc/dist,
# based on byacc2netbsd by Bernd Ernesti and changes by Simon Burge
#
# Rough instructions for importing new byacc release:
#
#	$ cd /some/where/temporary
#	$ tar xpfz /new/byacc/release/tar/file
#	$ sh /usr/src/external/bsd/byacc/byacc2netbsd byacc-YYYYMMDD `pwd`
#	$ cd src/external/bsd/byacc/dist
#	$ cvs import -m "Import byacc YYYYMMDD" src/external/bsd/byacc/dist DICKEY byacc-YYYYMMDD
#	$ cd ../../../../../byacc-YYYYMMDD
#	$ run ./configure
#	$ run make
#	check the config file and copy it to /usr/src/external/bsd/byacc/include
#	remove the version from SYSTEM_NAME
#	check the manual page against our copy if there are new options and
#	update
