version=4

# upstream provides tarballs such as "byacc-20220101.tgz" (originally to
# keep the filenames compatible with systems where multiple "." are illegal).
#
# The version number (2.0) is current since late 2020; before that it was
# "1.9" for a long time.  Use
#    byacc -V
# to see the version number:
#    byacc - 2.0 20220101
#
# The introduction of the back-tracking configuration motivated the change of
# major/minor numbers; for compatibility the parser skeleton still says "1.9".
#
# Patch-dates are always # in yyyymmdd format.
