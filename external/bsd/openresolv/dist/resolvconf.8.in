.Sh NAME
.Nm resolvconf
.Nd a framework for managing multiple DNS configurations
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Fl I
.Nm
.Op Fl m Ar metric
.Op Fl p
.Fl a Ar interface No < Ns Pa file
.Nm
.Op Fl f
.Fl d Ar interface
.Nm
.Fl il Ar pattern

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
manages
.Xr resolv.conf 5
files from multiple sources, such as DHCP and VPN clients.
Traditionally, the host runs just one client and that updates
.Pa /etc/resolv.conf .
More modern systems frequently have wired and wireless interfaces and there is
no guarantee both are on the same network.
With the advent of VPN and other
types of networking daemons, many things now contend for the contents of
.Pa /etc/resolv.conf .
.Pp
.Nm
solves this by letting the daemon send their
.Xr resolv.conf 5
file to
.Nm
via
.Xr stdin 3
with the argument
.Fl a Ar interface
instead of the filesystem.
.Nm
then updates
.Pa /etc/resolv.conf
as it thinks best.
When a local resolver other than libc is installed, such as
.Xr dnsmasq 8
or
.Xr named 8 ,
then
.Nm
will supply files that the resolver should be configured to include.
.Pp
.Nm
can mark an interfaces
.Pa resolv.conf
as private.
This means that the name servers listed in that
.Pa resolv.conf
are only used for queries against the domain/search listed in the same file.
This only works when a local resolver other than libc is installed. 
See
.Xr resolvconf.conf 5
for how to configure
.Nm
to use a local name server.
.Pp
When an interface goes down, it should then call
.Nm
with
.Fl d Ar interface
arguments to delete the
.Pa resolv.conf
file for the
.Ar interface .
.Pp
Here are some more options that
.Nm
has:-
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl I
Initialise the state directory
.Pa @VARDIR@ .
This only needs to be called if the initial system boot sequence does not
automatically clean it out; for example the state directory is moved
somewhere other than
.Pa /var/run .
If used, it should only be called once as early in the system boot sequence
as possible and before
.Nm
is used to add interfaces.
.It Fl f
Ignore non existant interfaces.
Only really useful for deleting interfaces.
.It Fl i Ar pattern
List the interfaces, optionally matching
.Ar pattern ,
we have
.Pa resolv.conf
files for.
.It Fl l Ar pattern
List the
.Pa resolv.conf
files we have.
If
.Ar pattern
is specified then we list the files for the interfaces that match it.
.It Fl m Ar metric
Set the metric of the interface when adding it, default of 0.
Lower metrics take precedence.
This affects the default order of interfaces when listed.
.It Fl p
Marks the interface
.Pa resolv.conf
as private.
.It Fl u
Force
.Nm
to update all it's subscribers.
.Nm
does not update the subscribers when adding a resolv.conf that matches
what it already has for that interface.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
also has some options designed to be used by it's subscribers:-
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl v
Echo variables DOMAINS, SEARCH and NAMESERVERS so that the subscriber can
configure the resolver easily.
.El
.Sh INTERFACE ORDERING
For
.Nm
to work effectively, it has to process the resolv.confs for the interfaces
in the correct order.
.Nm
first processes interfaces from the
.Sy interface_order
list, then interfaces without a metic and that match the
.Sy dynamic_order
list, then interfaces with a metric in order and finally the rest in
the operating systems lexical order.
See
.Xr resolvconf.conf 5
for details on these lists.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
If a subscriber has the executable bit then it is executed otherwise it is
assumed to be a shell script and sourced into the current environment in a
subshell.
This is done so that subscribers can remain fast, but are also not limited
to the shell language.
.Pp
Portable subscribers should not use anything outside of
.Pa /bin
and
.Pa /sbin
because
.Pa /usr
and others may not be available when booting.
Also, it would be unwise to assume any shell specific features.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -ohang
.It Va IF_METRIC
If the
.Fl m
option is not present then we use
.Va IF_METRIC
for the metric.
.It Va IF_PRIVATE
Marks the interface
.Pa resolv.conf
as private.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -ohang
.It Pa @SYSCONFDIR@/resolvconf.conf
Configuration file for
.Nm .
.It Pa @LIBEXECDIR@
Directory of subscribers which are run every time
.Nm
adds, deletes or updates.
.It Pa @LIBEXECDIR@/libc.d
Directory of subscribers which are run after the libc subscriber is run.
.It Pa @VARDIR@
State directory for
.Nm .
.El
.Sh HISTORY
This implementation of
.Nm
is called openresolv and is fully command line compatible with Debian's
resolvconf, as written by Thomas Hood.

.Pp
.Nm
does not validate any of the files given to it.
.Pp
When running a local resolver other than libc, you will need to configure it
to include files that
.Nm
will generate.
You should consult
.Xr resolvconf.conf 5
for instructions on how to configure your resolver.
