.Sh NAME
.Nm resolvconf.conf
.Nd resolvconf configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the configuration file for
.Xr resolvconf 8 .
The
.Nm
file is a shell script that is sourced by
.Xr resolvconf 8 ,
meaning that
.Nm
must contain valid shell commands.
Listed below are the standard
.Nm
variables that may be set.
.Pp
After updating this file, you may wish to run
.Nm resolvconf -u
to apply the new configuration.
.Sh RESOLVCONF OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Sy interface_order
These interfaces will always be processed first.
If unset, defaults to the following:-
.D1 lo lo[0-9]*
.It Sy dynamic_order
These interfaces will be processed next, unless they have a metric.
If unset, defaults to the following:-
.D1 tap[0-9]* tun[0-9]* vpn vpn[0-9]* ppp[0-9]* ippp[0-9]*
.It Sy search_domains
Prepend search domains to the dynamically generated list.
.It Sy search_domains_append
Append search domains to the dynamically generated list.
.It Sy domain_blacklist
A list of domains to be removed from consideration.
To remove a domain, you can use foo.*
To remove a sub domain, you can use *.bar
.It Sy name_servers
Prepend name servers to the dynamically generated list.
You should set this to 127.0.0.1 if you use a local name server other than
libc.
.It Sy name_servers_append
Append name servers to the dynamically generated list.
.It Sy name_server_blacklist
A list of name servers to be removed from consideration.
The default is 0.0.0.0 as some faulty routers send it via DHCP.
To remove a block, you can use 192.168.*
.It Sy private_interfaces
These interfaces name servers will only be queried for the domains listed
in their resolv.conf.
Useful for VPN domains.
This is equivalent to the
.Nm resolvconf -p
option.
.It Sy state_dir
Override the default state directory of
.Pa @VARDIR@ .
This should not be changed once
.Nm resolvconf
is in use unless the old directory is copied to the new one.
.El
.Sh LIBC OPTIONS
The following variables affect
.Xr resolv.conf 5
directly:-
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Sy resolv_conf
Defaults to
.Pa /etc/resolv.conf
if not set.
.It Sy resolv_conf_options
A list of libc resolver options, as specified in
.Xr resolv.conf 5 .
.It Sy resolv_conf_passthrough
When set to YES the latest resolv.conf is written to
.Sy resolv_conf
without any alteration.
.It Sy resolv_conf_sortlist
A libc resolver sortlist, as specified in
.Xr resolv.conf 5 .
.It Sy resolv_conf_local_only
If a local nameserver is configured then the default is just to specify that
and ignore all other entries as they will be configured for the local
nameserver.
Set this to YES to list them instead, if you need working DNS and the local
nameserver stops functioning at the expense of duplicated server queries.
.El
.Sh SUBSCRIBER OPTIONS
openresolv ships with subscribers for the name servers
.Xr dnsmasq 8 ,
.Xr named 8 ,
.Xr pdnsd 8
and
.Xr unbound 8 .
Each subscriber can create configuration files which should be included in
in the subscribers main configuration file.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Sy dnsmasq_conf
This file tells dnsmasq which nameservers to use for specific domains.
.It Sy dnsmasq_resolv
This file tells dnsmasq which nameservers to use for global lookups.
.Pp
Example resolvconf.conf for dnsmasq:
.D1 nameservers=127.0.0.1
.D1 dnsmasq_conf=/etc/dnsmasq-conf.conf
.D1 dnsmasq_resolv=/etc/dnsmasq-resolv.conf
.Pp
Example dnsmasq.conf:
.D1 listen-address=127.0.0.1
.D1 conf-file=/etc/dnsmasq-conf.conf
.D1 resolv-file=/etc/dnsmasq-resolv.conf
.It Sy named_options
Include this file in the named options block.
This file tells named which nameservers to use for global lookups.
.It Sy named_zones
Include this file in the named global scope, after the options block.
This file tells named which nameservers to use for specific domains.
.Pp
Example resolvconf.conf for named:
.D1 nameservers=127.0.0.1
.D1 named_options=/etc/named-options.conf
.D1 named_zones=/etc/named-zones.conf
.Pp
Example named.conf:
.D1 options {
.D1 	listen-on { 127.0.0.1; };
.D1 	include "/etc/named-options.conf";
.D1 };
.D1 include "/etc/named-zones.conf";
.It Sy pdnsd_conf
This is the main pdnsd configuration file which we modify to add our
forward domains to.
If this variable is not set then we rely on the pdnsd configuration file
setup to read
.Pa pdnsd_resolv
as documented below.
.It Sy pdnsd_resolv
This file tells pdnsd about global nameservers.
If this variable is not set then it's written to
.Pa pdnsd_conf .
.Pp
Example resolvconf.conf for pdnsd:
.D1 nameservers=127.0.0.1
.D1 pdnsd_conf=/etc/pdnsd.conf
.D1 # pdnsd_resolv=/etc/pdnsd-resolv.conf
.Pp
Example pdnsd.conf:
.D1 global {
.D1 	server_ip = 127.0.0.1;
.D1 	status_ctl = on;
.D1 }
.D1 server {
.D1 	# A server definition is required, even if emtpy.
.D1 	label="empty";
.D1 	proxy_only=on;
.D1 	# file="/etc/pdnsd-resolv.conf";
.D1 }
.It Sy unbound_conf
This file tells unbound about specific and global nameservers.
.Pp
Example resolvconf.conf for unbound:
.D1 nameservers=127.0.0.1
.D1 unbound_conf=/etc/unbound-resolvconf.conf
.Pp
Example unbound.conf:
.D1 include: /etc/unbound-resolvconf.conf
