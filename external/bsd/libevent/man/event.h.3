.br
These functions are used to safely tear down an event in a multithreaded application\&.
.PP
If you construct your events with EV_FINALIZE to avoid deadlocks, you will need a way to remove an event in the certainty that it will definitely not be running its callback when you deallocate it and its callback argument\&.
.PP
To do this, call one of event_finalize() or event_free_finalize with 0 for its first argument, the event to tear down as its second argument, and a callback function as its third argument\&. The callback will be invoked as part of the event loop, with the event's priority\&.
.PP
After you call a finalizer function, \fBevent_add()\fP and \fBevent_active()\fP will no longer work on the event, and \fBevent_del()\fP will produce a no-op\&. You must not try to change the event's fields with \fBevent_assign()\fP or \fBevent_set()\fP while the finalize callback is in progress\&. Once the callback has been invoked, you should treat the event structure as containing uninitialized memory\&.
.PP
The event_free_finalize() function frees the event after it's finalized; event_finalize() does not\&.
.PP
A finalizer callback must not make events pending or active\&. It must not add events, activate events, or attempt to 'resucitate' the event being finalized in any way\&.
.PP
THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL API\&. IT MIGHT CHANGE BEFORE THE LIBEVENT 2\&.1 SERIES BECOMES STABLE\&.

.PP
Detects connection close events\&. You can use this to detect when a connection has been closed, without having to read all the pending data from a connection\&.
.PP
Not all backends support EV_CLOSED\&. To detect or require it, use the feature flag EV_FEATURE_EARLY_CLOSE\&. 
.SS "#define EV_ET   0x20"

.PP
Select edge-triggered behavior, if supported by the backend\&. 
.SS "#define EV_FINALIZE   0x40"

.PP
If this option is provided, then \fBevent_del()\fP will not block in one thread while waiting for the event callback to complete in another thread\&. To use this option safely, you may need to use event_finalize() or event_free_finalize() in order to safely tear down an event in a multithreaded application\&. See those functions for more information\&.
.PP
THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL API\&. IT MIGHT CHANGE BEFORE THE LIBEVENT 2\&.1 SERIES BECOMES STABLE\&. 
.SS "#define EV_PERSIST   0x10"

.PP
Indicates that a timeout has occurred\&. It's not necessary to pass this flag to event_for new()/event_assign() to get a timeout\&.

.PP
count the number of virtual events, which is used to represent an internal condition, other than a pending event, that keeps the loop from exiting\&. 
.SS "#define EVENT_MAX_PRIORITIES   256"

.PP
Largest number of priorities that Libevent can support\&. 
.SS "#define EVLOOP_NO_EXIT_ON_EMPTY   0x04"

.PP
Do not exit the loop because we have no pending events\&. Instead, keep running until \fBevent_base_loopexit()\fP or \fBevent_base_loopbreak()\fP makes us stop\&. 
.SS "#define EVLOOP_NONBLOCK   0x02"

.PP
Do not block: see which events are ready now, run the callbacks of the highest-priority ones, then exit\&. 
.SS "#define EVLOOP_ONCE   0x01"

.PP
Block until we have an active event, then exit once all active events have had their callbacks run\&.

\fB\fIEVENT_BASE_FLAG_NOLOCK \fP\fP
Do not allocate a lock for the event base, even if we have locking set up\&. Setting this option will make it unsafe and nonfunctional to call functions on the base concurrently from multiple threads\&. 
.TP
\fB\fIEVENT_BASE_FLAG_IGNORE_ENV \fP\fP
Do not check the EVENT_* environment variables when configuring an \fBevent_base\fP\&. 
.TP
\fB\fIEVENT_BASE_FLAG_STARTUP_IOCP \fP\fP
Windows only: enable the IOCP dispatcher at startup\&. If this flag is set then \fBbufferevent_socket_new()\fP and evconn_listener_new() will use IOCP-backed implementations instead of the usual select-based one on Windows\&. 
.TP
\fB\fIEVENT_BASE_FLAG_NO_CACHE_TIME \fP\fP
Instead of checking the current time every time the event loop is ready to run timeout callbacks, check after each timeout callback\&. 
.TP
\fB\fIEVENT_BASE_FLAG_EPOLL_USE_CHANGELIST \fP\fP
If we are using the epoll backend, this flag says that it is safe to use Libevent's internal change-list code to batch up adds and deletes in order to try to do as few syscalls as possible\&. Setting this flag can make your code run faster, but it may trigger a Linux bug: it is not safe to use this flag if you have any fds cloned by dup() or its variants\&. Doing so will produce strange and hard-to-diagnose bugs\&.
.PP
This flag can also be activated by setting the EVENT_EPOLL_USE_CHANGELIST environment variable\&.

A flag used to describe which features an \fBevent_base\fP (must) provide\&. Because of OS limitations, not every Libevent backend supports every possible feature\&. You can use this type with \fBevent_config_require_features()\fP to tell Libevent to only proceed if your \fBevent_base\fP implements a given feature, and you can receive this type from \fBevent_base_get_features()\fP to see which features are available\&.

.SS "EVENT2_EXPORT_SYMBOL void event_active (struct \fBevent\fP * ev, int res, short ncalls)"

.PP
Make an event active\&. You can use this function on a pending or a non-pending event to make it active, so that its callback will be run by \fBevent_base_dispatch()\fP or \fBevent_base_loop()\fP\&.

.SS "EVENT2_EXPORT_SYMBOL int event_add (struct \fBevent\fP * ev, const struct timeval * timeout)"

.PP
Add an event to the set of pending events\&. The function \fBevent_add()\fP schedules the execution of the event 'ev' when the condition specified by \fBevent_assign()\fP or \fBevent_new()\fP occurs, or when the time specified in timeout has elapesed\&. If atimeout is NULL, no timeout occurs and the function will only be called if a matching event occurs\&. The event in the ev argument must be already initialized by \fBevent_assign()\fP or \fBevent_new()\fP and may not be used in calls to \fBevent_assign()\fP until it is no longer pending\&.
.PP
If the event in the ev argument already has a scheduled timeout, calling \fBevent_add()\fP replaces the old timeout with the new one if tv is non-NULL\&.

.PP
Prepare a new, already-allocated event structure to be added\&. The function \fBevent_assign()\fP prepares the event structure ev to be used in future calls to \fBevent_add()\fP and \fBevent_del()\fP\&. Unlike \fBevent_new()\fP, it doesn't allocate memory itself: it requires that you have already allocated a struct event, probably on the heap\&. Doing this will typically make your code depend on the size of the event structure, and thereby create incompatibility with future versions of Libevent\&.
.PP
The easiest way to avoid this problem is just to use \fBevent_new()\fP and \fBevent_free()\fP instead\&.
.PP
A slightly harder way to future-proof your code is to use \fBevent_get_struct_event_size()\fP to determine the required size of an event at runtime\&.
.PP
Note that it is NOT safe to call this function on an event that is active or pending\&. Doing so WILL corrupt internal data structures in Libevent, and lead to strange, hard-to-diagnose bugs\&. You \fIcan\fP use event_assign to change an existing event, but only if it is not active or pending!

.PP
To do this, call this function with the common duration\&. It will return a pointer to a different, opaque timeout value\&. (Don't depend on its actual contents!) When you use this timeout value in \fBevent_add()\fP, Libevent will schedule the event more efficiently\&.
.PP
(This optimization probably will not be worthwhile until you have thousands or tens of thousands of events with the same timeout\&.)

Wait for events to become active, and run their callbacks\&. This is a more flexible version of \fBevent_base_dispatch()\fP\&.

.PP
Set the number of different event priorities\&. By default Libevent schedules all active events with the same priority\&. However, some time it is desirable to process some events with a higher priority than others\&. For that reason, Libevent supports strict priority queues\&. Active events with a lower priority are always processed before events with a higher priority\&.

The number of different priorities can be set initially with the \fBevent_base_priority_init()\fP function\&. This function should be called before the first call to \fBevent_base_dispatch()\fP\&. The \fBevent_priority_set()\fP function can be used to assign a priority to an event\&. By default, Libevent assigns the middle priority to all events unless their priority is explicitly set\&.

Note that urgent-priority events can starve less-urgent events: after running all urgent-priority callbacks, Libevent checks for more urgent events again, before running less-urgent events\&.

.SS "EVENT2_EXPORT_SYMBOL int event_remove_timer (struct \fBevent\fP * ev)"

.PP
Remove a timer from a pending event without removing the event itself\&. If the event has a scheduled timeout, this function unschedules it but leaves the event otherwise pending\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIev\fP an event struct initialized via \fBevent_assign()\fP or \fBevent_new()\fP 
.RE
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
0 on success, or -1 if an error occurrect\&.

.SS "EVENT2_EXPORT_SYMBOL void* event_self_cbarg (void)"

.PP
Return a value used to specify that the event itself must be used as the callback argument\&. The function \fBevent_new()\fP takes a callback argument which is passed to the event's callback function\&. To specify that the argument to be passed to the callback function is the event that \fBevent_new()\fP returns, pass in the return value of \fBevent_self_cbarg()\fP as the callback argument for \fBevent_new()\fP\&.
.PP
For example: 
.PP
.nf

    struct event *ev = event_new(base, sock, events, callback, event_self_cbarg());
.fi
.PP
.PP
For consistency with \fBevent_new()\fP, it is possible to pass the return value of this function as the callback argument for \fBevent_assign()\fP -- this achieves the same result as passing the event in directly\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP

.SS "EVENT2_EXPORT_SYMBOL void event_set_fatal_callback (\fBevent_fatal_cb\fP cb)"

.PP
Override Libevent's behavior in the event of a fatal internal error\&. By default, Libevent will call exit(1) if a programming error makes it impossible to continue correct operation\&. This function allows you to supply another callback instead\&. Note that if the function is ever invoked, something is wrong with your program, or with Libevent: any subsequent calls to Libevent may result in undefined behavior\&.
.PP
Libevent will (almost) always log an EVENT_LOG_ERR message before calling this function; look at the last log message to see why Libevent has died\&. 
.SS "EVENT2_EXPORT_SYMBOL void event_set_log_callback (\fBevent_log_cb\fP cb)"

.PP
Redirect Libevent's log messages\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIcb\fP a function taking two arguments: an integer severity between EVENT_LOG_DEBUG and EVENT_LOG_ERR, and a string\&. If cb is NULL, then the default log is used\&.
.RE
.PP
NOTE: The function you provide \fImust not\fP call any other libevent functionality\&. Doing so can produce undefined behavior\&. 
.SS "EVENT2_EXPORT_SYMBOL void event_set_mem_functions (void *(*)(size_t sz) malloc_fn, void *(*)(void *ptr, size_t sz) realloc_fn, void(*)(void *ptr) free_fn)"

.PP
Override the functions that Libevent uses for memory management\&. Usually, Libevent uses the standard libc functions malloc, realloc, and free to allocate memory\&. Passing replacements for those functions to \fBevent_set_mem_functions()\fP overrides this behavior\&.
.PP
Note that all memory returned from Libevent will be allocated by the replacement functions rather than by malloc() and realloc()\&. Thus, if you have replaced those functions, it will not be appropriate to free() memory that you get from Libevent\&. Instead, you must use the free_fn replacement that you provided\&.
.PP
Note also that if you are going to call this function, you should do so before any call to any Libevent function that does allocation\&. Otherwise, those funtions will allocate their memory using malloc(), but then later free it using your provided free_fn\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fImalloc_fn\fP A replacement for malloc\&. 
.br
\fIrealloc_fn\fP A replacement for realloc 
.br
\fIfree_fn\fP A replacement for free\&.

.SS "EVENT2_EXPORT_SYMBOL void libevent_global_shutdown (void)"

.PP
Release up all globally-allocated resources allocated by Libevent\&. This function does not free developer-controlled resources like event_bases, events, bufferevents, listeners, and so on\&. It only releases resources like global locks that there is no other way to free\&.
.PP
It is not actually necessary to call this function before exit: every resource that it frees would be released anyway on exit\&. It mainly exists so that resource-leak debugging tools don't see Libevent as holding resources at exit\&.
.PP
You should only call this function when no other Libevent functions will be invoked -- e\&.g\&., when cleanly exiting a program\&.
