.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions are OpenPAM extensions to the PAM API.
Those named
.Fn pam_*
are, in the author's opinion, logical and necessary extensions to the
standard API, while those named
.Fn openpam_*
are either simple convenience functions, or functions intimately tied
to OpenPAM implementation details, and therefore not well suited to
standardization.
