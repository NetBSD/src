.Dt PAM_GET_AUTHTOK 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pam_get_authtok
.Nd retrieve authentication token
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libpam
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In security/pam_appl.h
.Ft "int"
.Fn pam_get_authtok "pam_handle_t *pamh" "int item" "const char **authtok" "const char *prompt"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function returns the cached authentication token,
or prompts the user if no token is currently cached.
Either way, a pointer to the authentication token is stored in the
location pointed to by the
.Fa authtok
argument.
.Pp
The
.Fa item
argument must have one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width 18n
.It Dv PAM_AUTHTOK
Returns the current authentication token, or the new token
when changing authentication tokens.
.It Dv PAM_OLDAUTHTOK
Returns the previous authentication token when changing
authentication tokens.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fa prompt
argument specifies a prompt to use if no token is cached.
If it is
.Dv NULL ,
the
.Dv PAM_AUTHTOK_PROMPT
or
.Dv PAM_OLDAUTHTOK_PROMPT
item,
as appropriate, will be used.
If that item is also
.Dv NULL ,
a hardcoded default prompt will be used.
Either way, the prompt is expanded using
.Xr openpam_subst 3
before it is
passed to the conversation function.
.Pp
If
.Nm
is called from a module and the
.Dv authtok_prompt
/
.Dv oldauthtok_prompt
option is set in the policy file, the value of that
option takes precedence over both the
.Fa prompt
argument and the
.Dv PAM_AUTHTOK_PROMPT
/
.Dv PAM_OLDAUTHTOK_PROMPT
item.
.Pp
If
.Fa item
is set to
.Dv PAM_AUTHTOK
and there is a non-null
.Dv PAM_OLDAUTHTOK
item,
.Nm
will ask the user to confirm the new token by
retyping it.
If there is a mismatch,
.Nm
will return
.Dv PAM_TRY_AGAIN .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm
function returns one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width 18n
.It Bq Er PAM_BUF_ERR
Memory buffer error.
.It Bq Er PAM_CONV_ERR
Conversation failure.
.It Bq Er PAM_SYSTEM_ERR
System error.
.It Bq Er PAM_TRY_AGAIN
Try again.
