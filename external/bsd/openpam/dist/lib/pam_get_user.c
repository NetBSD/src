/**
 * The =pam_get_user function returns the name of the target user, as
 * specified to =pam_start.
 * If no user was specified, nor set using =pam_set_item, =pam_get_user
 * will prompt for a user name.
 * Either way, a pointer to the user name is stored in the location
 * pointed to by the =user argument.
 *
 * The =prompt argument specifies a prompt to use if no user name is
 * cached.
 * If it is =NULL, the =PAM_USER_PROMPT item will be used.
 * If that item is also =NULL, a hardcoded default prompt will be used.
 * Either way, the prompt is expanded using =openpam_subst before it is
 * passed to the conversation function.
 *
 * If =pam_get_user is called from a module and the ;user_prompt option is
 * set in the policy file, the value of that option takes precedence over
 * both the =prompt argument and the =PAM_USER_PROMPT item.
