                 Release notes for OpenPAM Ourouparia
                 ====================================

This release corresponds to the code used in FreeBSD HEAD as of the
release date, and is also expected to work on almost any POSIX-like
platform that has GNU autotools, GNU make and the GNU compiler suite
installed.

The distribution consists of the following components:

 - The PAM library itself, with complete API documentation.

 - Sample modules (pam_permit, pam_deny and pam_unix) and a sample
   application (su) which demonstrate how to use PAM.

 - A test application (pamtest) which can be used to test policies and
   modules.

 - Unit tests for limited portions of the libraries.

Please direct bug reports and inquiries to <des@des.no>.
