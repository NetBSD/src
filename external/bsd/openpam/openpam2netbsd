# openpam2netbsd:  convert an openpam source tree into a
# netbsd openp source tree, under src/dist,
#
# Rough instructions for importing new openp release:
#
#	$ cd /some/where/temporary
#	$ tar xpfz /new/openpam/release/tar/file
#	$ sh /usr/src/external/bsd/openpam/openp2netbsd openpam-YYYYMMDD
#	$ cd openpam-YYYYMMDD
#	$ cvs -d cvs.netbsd.org:/cvsroot import -m "Import openpam-YYYYMMDD" src/external/bsd/openpam/dist OPENPAM flower-YYYYMMDD
#	$ cd ../../../am-utils-6.x.y
#	$ run ./configure
# merge newly generated config.h with /usr/src/usr.sbin/openp/include/config.h
# very carefully, since autoconfig seems to be broken (at least in 6.0.4)
#	$ cd ..
#	$ rm -r src am-utils-6.x.y
#	$ cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/openp
#	$ cvs commit -m "Updated autoconf generated files for am-utils 6.x.y."
#
#	- check makefiles to see if any extra sources have been added.
#	- update distrib/sets if necessary.
