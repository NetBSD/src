@chapter Ex Description

The following words have special meanings for
@CO{ex}
commands.
@itemize @bullet
@cindex "<end-of-file>"
@IP{<end-of-file>}

The end-of-file character is used to scroll the screen in the
@CO{ex}
editor.
This character is normally
@LI{<control-D>}.
However, whatever character is set for the current terminal is supported
as well as
@LI{<control-D>}.
@cindex "line"
@IP{line}

A single-line address, given in any of the forms described in the
section entitled
@QB{Ex Addressing} .
The default for
@LI{line}is the current line.
@cindex "range"
@IP{range}

A line, or a pair of line addresses, separated by a comma or semicolon.
(See the section entitled
@QB{Ex Addressing}
for more information.)
The default for range is the current line
@emph{only},
i.e.
@QT{.,.}.
A percent sign
@PQ{%}
stands for the range
@QT{1,$}.
The starting address must be less than, or equal to, the ending address.
@cindex "count"
@IP{count}

A positive integer, specifying the number of lines to be affected by
the command; the default is 1.
Generally, a count past the end-of-file may be specified, e.g. the
command
@QT{p 3000}
in a 10 line file is acceptable, and will print from the current line
through the last line in the file.
@cindex "flags"
@IP{flags}

One or more of the characters
@QQ{#},
@QQ{p},
and
@QQ{l}.
When a command that accepts these flags completes, the addressed line(s)
are written out as if by the corresponding
@CO{#},
@CO{l}
or
@CO{p}
commands.
In addition, any number of
@QT{+}
or
@QT{-}
characters can be specified before, after, or during the flags, in which
case the line written is not necessarily the one affected by the command,
but rather the line addressed by the offset address specified.
The default for
@LI{flags}is none.
@cindex "file"
@IP{file}

A pattern used to derive a pathname; the default is the current file.
File names are subjected to normal
@XR{sh,1}
word expansions.
@end itemize

Anywhere a file name is specified, it is also possible to use
the special string
@QT{/tmp}.
This will be replaced with a temporary file name which can be used
for temporary work, e.g.
@QT{:e /tmp}
creates and edits a new file.

If both a count and a range are specified for commands that use either,
the starting line for the command is the
@emph{last}
line addressed by the range, and
@LI{count}- 1
subsequent lines are affected by the command, e.g. the command
@QT{2,3p4}
prints out lines 3, 4, 5 and 6.

When only a line or range is specified, with no command, the implied
command is either a
@CO{list},
@CO{number}
or
@CO{print}
command.
The command used is the most recent of the three commands to have been
used (including any use as a flag).
If none of these commands have been used before, the
@CO{print}
command is the implied command.
When no range or count is specified and the command line is a blank line,
the current line is incremented by 1 and then the current line is displayed.

Zero or more whitespace characters may precede or follow the addresses,
count, flags, or command name.
Any object following a command name (such as buffer, file, etc.),
that begins with an alphabetic character,
should be separated from the command name by at least one whitespace
character.

Any character, including
@LI{<carriage-return>},
@QT{%}
and
@QT{#}
retain their literal value when preceded by a backslash.
@chapter Ex Commands

The following section describes the commands available in the
@CO{ex}
editor.
In each entry below, the tag line is a usage synopsis for the command.

Each command can be entered as the abbreviation
(those characters in the synopsis command word preceding the
@QQ{[}
character),
the full command (all characters shown for the command word,
omitting the
@QQ{[}
and
@QQ{]}
characters),
or any leading subset of the full command down to the abbreviation.
For example, the args command (shown as
@QT{ar[gs]}
in the synopsis)
can be entered as
@QT{ar},
@QT{arg}
or
@QT{args}.

Each
@CO{ex}
command described below notes the new current line after it
is executed, as well as any options that affect the command.
@cindex DOUBLEQUOTE
@deftypefn Command {} {"}

A comment.
Command lines beginning with the double-quote character
@PQ{"}
are ignored.
This permits comments in editor scripts and startup files.
@end deftypefn
@cindex "<control-D>"
@cindex "<end-of-file>"
@deftypefn Command {} {<control-D>}

@deftypefnx Command {} {<end-of-file>}

Scroll the screen.
Write the next N lines, where N is the value of the
@OP{scroll}
option.
The command is the end-of-file terminal character, which may be
different on different terminals.
Traditionally, it is the
@LI{<control-D>}key.
@sp 1
Historically, the
@CO{eof}
command ignored any preceding count, and the
@LI{<end-of-file>}character was ignored unless it was entered as the first character
of the command.
This implementation treats it as a command
@emph{only}
if entered as the first character of the command line, and otherwise
treats it as any other character.
@table @asis
@item Line:
Set to the last line written.
@item Options:
Affected by the
@OP{scroll}
option.
@end table
@end deftypefn
@cindex "!"
@deftypefn Command {} {!} {argument(s)}

@deftypefnx Command {}  {[range]!} {argument(s)}
Execute a shell command, or filter lines through a shell command.
In the first synopsis, the remainder of the line after the
@QT{!}
character is passed to the program named by the
@OP{shell}
option, as a single argument.
@sp 1
Within the rest of the line,
@QT{%}
and
@QT{#}
are expanded into the current and alternate pathnames, respectively.
The character
@QT{!}
is expanded with the command text of the previous
@CO{!}
command.
(Therefore, the command
@CO{!!}
repeats the previous
@CO{!}
command.)
The special meanings of
@QT{%},
@QT{#},
and
@QT{!}
can be overridden by escaping them with a backslash.
If no
@CO{!}
or
@CO{:!}
command has yet been executed, it is an error to use an unescaped
@QT{!}
character.
The
@CO{!}
command does
@emph{not}
do shell expansion on the strings provided as arguments.
If any of the above expansions change the command the user entered,
the command is redisplayed at the bottom of the screen.
@sp 1
@CO{Ex}
then executes the program named by the
@OP{shell}
option, with a
@strong{-c}
flag followed by the arguments (which are bundled into a single argument).
@sp 1
The
@CO{!}
command is permitted in an empty file.
@sp 1
If the file has been modified since it was last completely written,
the
@CO{!}
command will warn you.
@sp 1
A single
@QT{!}
character is displayed when the command completes.
@sp 1
In the second form of the
@CO{!}
command, the remainder of the line after the
@QT{!}
is passed to the program named by the
@OP{shell}
option, as described above.
The specified lines are passed to the program as standard input,
and the standard and standard error output of the program replace
the original lines.
@table @asis
@item Line:
Unchanged if no range was specified, otherwise set to the first
line of the range.
@item Options:
Affected by the
@OP{shell}
and
@OP{warn}
options.
@end table
@end deftypefn
@cindex "#"
@deftypefn Command {[range]} {#} {[count] [flags]}

@cindex "number"
@deftypefnx Command  {[range]} {nu[mber]} {[count] [flags]}
Display the selected lines, each preceded with its line number.
@sp 1
The line number format is
@QQ{%6d},
followed by two spaces.
@table @asis
@item Line:
Set to the last line displayed.
@item Options:
Affected by the
@OP{list}
option.
@end table
@end deftypefn
@cindex "@@"
@deftypefn Command {@@} {buffer}

@cindex "*"
@deftypefnx Command {}  {*} {buffer}
Execute a buffer.
Each line in the named buffer is executed as an
@CO{ex}
command.
If no buffer is specified, or if the specified buffer is
@QT{@@}
or
@QT{*},
the last buffer executed is used.
@end deftypefn
@cindex <
@deftypefn Command {[range]} {<[< ...]} {[count] [flags]}

Shift lines left or right.
The specified lines are shifted to the left (for the
@CO{<}
command) or right (for the
@CO{>}
command), by the number of columns specified by the
@OP{shiftwidth}
option.
Only leading whitespace characters are deleted when shifting left;
once the first column of the line contains a nonblank character,
the
@CO{shift}
command will succeed, but the line will not be modified.
@sp 1
If the command character
@CO{<}
or
@CO{>}
is repeated more than once, the command is repeated once for each
additional command character.
@table @asis
@item Line:
If the current line is set to one of the lines that are affected
by the command, it is unchanged.
Otherwise, it is set to the first nonblank character of the lowest
numbered line shifted.
@item Options:
Affected by the
@OP{shiftwidth}
option.
@end table
@end deftypefn
@cindex =
@deftypefn Command {[line]} {=} {[flags]}

Display the line number of
@LI{line}(which defaults to the last line in the file).
@table @asis
@item Line:
Unchanged.
@item Options:
None.
@end table
@end deftypefn
@cindex >
@deftypefn Command {[range]} {>[> ...]} {[count] [flags]}

Shift right.
The specified lines are shifted to the right by the number of columns
specified by the
@OP{shiftwidth}
option, by inserting tab and space characters.
Empty lines are not changed.
@sp 1
If the command character
@QT{>}
is repeated more than once, the command is repeated once for each
additional command character.
@table @asis
@item Line:
Set to the last line modified by the command.
@item Options:
Affected by the
@OP{shiftwidth}
option.
@end table
@end deftypefn
@cindex abbrev
@deftypefn Command {} {ab[brev]} {lhs rhs}

Add an abbreviation to the current abbreviation list.
When inserting text in
@CO{vi},
each time a non-word character is entered after a word character,
a set of characters ending at the word character are checked for
a match with
@LI{lhs}.
If a match is found, they are replaced with
@LI{rhs}.
The set of characters that are checked for a match are defined as follows,
for inexplicable historical reasons.
If only one or two characters were entered before the non-word character
that triggered the check,
and after the beginning of the insertion,
or the beginning of the line or the file,
or the last
@LI{<blank>}character that was entered,
then the one or the both characters are checked for a match.
Otherwise, the set includes both characters,
as well as the characters that precede them that are the same word
class (i.e. word or non-word) as the
@strong{second}
to last character entered before the non-word character that triggered
the check,
back to the first
@LI{<blank>}character,
the beginning of the insertion,
or the beginning of the line or the file.
@sp 1
For example, the abbreviations:
@sp 1
@multitable {:abbreviate} {/*#i} {/********************}
@item :abbreviate @tab abc @tab ABC
@item :abbreviate @tab #i @tab #include
@item :abbreviate @tab /*#i @tab /*#include
@end multitable
will all work, while the abbreviations:
@sp 1
@multitable {:abbreviate} {/*#i} {/********************}
@item :abbreviate @tab a#i @tab A#include
@item :abbreviate @tab /* @tab /********************
@end multitable
will not work, and are not permitted by
@CO{nvi}.
@sp 1
To keep the abbreviation expansion from happening,
the character immediately following the
@LI{lhs}characters should be quoted with a
@LI{<literal-next>}character.
@sp 1
The replacement
@LI{rhs}is itself subject to both further abbreviation expansion and further
map expansion.
@table @asis
@item Line:
Unchanged.
@item Options:
None.
@end table
@end deftypefn
@cindex append
@deftypefn Command {[line]} {a[ppend][!]}

The input text is appended to the specified line.
If line 0 is specified, the text is inserted at the beginning of the file.
Set to the last line input.
If no lines are input, then set to
@LI{line},
or to the first line of the file if a
@LI{line}of 0 was specified.
Following the command name with a
@QT{!}
character causes the
@OP{autoindent}
option to be toggled for the duration of the command.

@end table
@cindex cd
@end deftypefn
@cindex chdir
@deftypefn Command {} {chd[ir][!]} {[directory]}

@deftypefnx Command {}  {cd[!]} {[directory]}
Change the current working directory.
The
@LI{directory}argument is subjected to
@XR{sh,1}
word expansions.
When invoked with no directory argument and the
@LI{HOME}environment variable is set, the directory named by the
@LI{HOME}environment variable becomes the new current directory.
Otherwise, the new current directory becomes the directory returned
by the
@XR{getpwent,3}
routine.
@sp 1
The
@CO{chdir}
command will fail if the file has been modified since the last complete
write of the file.
You can override this check by appending a
@QT{!}
character to the command.

@cindex cscope
@deftypefn Command {} {cs[cope]} {command [args]}

Execute a
@CO{cscope}
command.
For more information, see the section of the reference manual entitled
@QB{Tags, Tag Stacks, and Cscope} .
@end deftypefn
@cindex delete
@deftypefn Command {[range]} {d[elete]} {[buffer] [count] [flags]}

Delete the lines from the file.
The deleted text is saved in the specified buffer, or, if no buffer
is specified, in the unnamed buffer.
If the command name is followed by a letter that could be interpreted
as either a buffer name or a flag value (because neither a
@LI{count}or
@LI{flags}values were given),
@CO{ex}
treats the letter as a
@LI{flags}value if the letter immediately follows the command name,
without any whitespace separation.
If the letter is preceded by whitespace characters,
it treats it as a buffer name.
@table @asis
@item Line:
Set to the line following the deleted lines,
or to the last line if the deleted lines were at the end.
@item Options:
None.
@end table
@end deftypefn
@cindex display
@deftypefn Command {} {di[splay]} {b[uffers] | c[onnections] | s[creens] | t[ags]}

Display buffers,
@CO{cscope}
connections, screens or tags.
The
@CO{display}
command takes one of three additional arguments, which are as follows:
@table @asis
@item b[uffers]
Display all buffers (including named, unnamed, and numeric)
that contain text.
@item c[onnections]
Display the source directories for all attached
@CO{cscope}
databases.
@item s[creens]
Display the file names of all background screens.
@item t[ags]
Display the tags stack.

@deftypefn Command {} {e[dit][!]} {[+cmd] [file]}
@deftypefnx Command {}  {ex[!]} {[+cmd] [file]}
@deftypefnx Command {} {vs[plit][!]} {[+cmd] [file]}
Edit a different file.
If the current buffer has been modified since the last complete write,
the command will fail.
You can override this by appending a
@QT{!}
character to the command name.
@sp 1
If the
@QT{+cmd}
option is specified, that
@CO{ex}
command will be executed in the new file.
Any
@CO{ex}
command may be used, although the most common use of this feature is
to specify a line number or search pattern to set the initial location
in the new file.
@sp 1
Capitalizing the first letter of the command, i.e.,
@CO{Edit}
or
@CO{Ex},
while in
@CO{vi}
mode, will edit the file in a new screen.
In this case, any modifications to the current file are ignored.
@cindex vertical split
@cindex splitting, vertically
@CO{vsplit} is similar, but the screen will be split vertically
to produce the new screen, rather than horizontally.

@table @asis
@item Line:
If you have previously edited the file, the current line will be set
to your last position in the file.
If that position does not exist, or you have not previously edited the
file, the current line will be set to the first line of the file if
you are in
@CO{vi}
mode, and the last line of the file if you are in
@CO{ex}.
@item Options:
None.
@end table
@end deftypefn
@cindex exusage
@deftypefn Command {} {exu[sage]} {[command]}

Display usage for an

Foreground the specified screen.
If the argument name doesn't exactly match the name of a file displayed
by a background screen,
it is compared against the last component of each of the file names.
If no background screen is specified,
the first background screen is foregrounded.
@sp 1
By default,
foregrounding causes the current screen to be swapped with the backgrounded
screen.
Capitalizing the first letter of the command, i.e.
@CO{Fg},
will foreground the backgrounded screen in a new screen instead of
swapping it with the current screen.
@table @asis
@item Line:
Set to the current line when the screen was last edited.
@item Options:

@end table
@end deftypefn
@cindex global
@deftypefn Command {[range]} {g[lobal]} {/pattern/ [commands]}

@cindex v
@deftypefnx Command  {[range]} {v} {/pattern/ [commands]}
Apply commands to lines matching (or not matching) a pattern.
The lines within the given range that match
@PQ{g[lobal]},
or do not match
@PQ{v}
the given pattern are selected.
Then, the specified
@CO{ex}
command(s) are executed with the current line
@PQ{.}
set to each selected line.
If no range is specified, the entire file is searched for matching,
or not matching, lines.
@sp 1
Multiple commands can be specified, one per line, by escaping each
@LI{<newline>}character with a backslash, or by separating commands with a
@QT{|}
character.
If no commands are specified, the command defaults to the
@CO{print}
command.
@sp 1
For the
@CO{append},
@CO{change}
and
@CO{insert}
commands, the input text must be part of the global command line.
In this case, the terminating period can be omitted if it ends the commands.
@sp 1
The
@CO{visual}
command may also be specified as one of the
@CO{ex}
commands.
In this mode, input is taken from the terminal.
Entering a
@CO{Q}
command in
@CO{vi}
mode causes the next line matching the pattern to be selected and
@CO{vi}
to be reentered, until the list is exhausted.
@sp 1
The
@CO{global},
@CO{v}
and
@CO{undo}
commands cannot be used as part of these commands.
@sp 1
The editor options
@OP{autoindent},

@cindex join
@deftypefn Command {[range]} {j[oin][!]} {[count] [flags]}

Join lines of text together.
@sp 1
A
@LI{count}specified to the
@CO{join}
command specifies that the last line of the
@LI{range}plus
@LI{count}subsequent lines will be joined.
(Note, this differs by one from the general rule where only
@LI{count}- 1
subsequent lines are affected.)
@sp 1
If the current line ends with a whitespace character, all whitespace
is stripped from the next line.
Otherwise, if the next line starts with a open parenthesis
@PQ{(},
do nothing.
Otherwise, if the current line ends with a question mark
@PQ{?},
period
@PQ{.}
or exclamation point
@PQ{!},
insert two spaces.
Otherwise, insert a single space.
@sp 1
Appending a
@QT{!}

@end table
@end deftypefn
@cindex map
@deftypefn Command {} {map[!]} {[lhs rhs]}

Define or display maps (for
@CO{vi}
only).
@sp 1
If
@QT{lhs}
and
@QT{rhs}
are not specified, the current set of command mode maps are displayed.
If a
@QT{!}
character is appended to to the command,
the text input mode maps are displayed.
@sp 1
Otherwise, when the
@QT{lhs}
character sequence is entered in
@CO{vi},
the action is as if the corresponding
@QT{rhs}
had been entered.
If a
@QT{!}
character is appended to the command name,
the mapping is effective during text input mode,
otherwise, it is effective during command mode.
This allows
@QT{lhs}
to have two different macro definitions at the same time: one for command
mode and one for input mode.
@sp 1
Whitespace characters require escaping with a
@LI{<literal-next>}character to be entered in the
@LI{lhs}string in visual mode.
@sp 1
Normally, keys in the
@LI{rhs}string are remapped (see the
@OP{remap}
option),
and it is possible to create infinite loops.
However, keys which map to themselves are not further remapped,
regardless of the setting of the
@OP{remap}
option.
For example, the command
@QT{:map n nz.}
maps the
@QT{n}
key to the

If
@LI{options}includes the letter
@QT{c}
(confirm), you will be prompted for confirmation before each replacement
is done.
An affirmative response (in English, a

A quit response (in English, a
@QT{q}
character) causes the
@CO{substitute}
command to be terminated.
Any other response causes the replacement not to be made, and the

command continues.
If
@LI{options}includes the letter
