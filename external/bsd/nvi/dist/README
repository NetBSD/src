    README ........ This file.
    build.unix .... UNIX build directory.
    catalog ....... Message catalogs; see catalog/README.
    cl ............ Vi interface to the curses(3) library.
    clib .......... C library replacement source code.

To build DB for a UNIX platform:

    cd build.unix
    ../dist/configure
    make

To build multiple UNIX versions of DB in the same source tree, create
a new directory then configure and build.

    mkdir build.bsdos3.0
    cd build.bsdos3.0
    ../dist/configure
    make

For additional information about building DB for UNIX platforms, the
description of possible configuration options and other information
on DB configuration and build issues, see the file build.unix/README.
	
Bug fixes and updated versions of this software will periodically be made
available.  For more information, as well as a list of Frequently Asked

o This software is several years old and is the product of many folks' work.  

	This software was originally derived from software contributed to
	the University of California, Berkeley by Steve Kirkendall, the
	author of the vi clone elvis.  Without his work, this work would
	have been far more difficult.

	IEEE POSIX 1003.2 style regular expression support is courtesy of
	Henry Spencer, for which I am *very* grateful.

	Elan Amir did the original 4BSD curses work that made it possible
	to support a full-screen editor using curses.

	George Neville-Neil added the Tcl interpreter, and the initial
	interpreter design was his.

	Sven Verdoolaege added the Perl interpreter.

	Rob Mayoff provided the original Cscope support.

o Many, many people suggested enhancements, and provided bug reports and
  testing, far too many to individually thank.

o From the original vi acknowledgements, by William Joy and Mark Horton:

	Bruce Englar encouraged the early development of this display
	editor.  Peter Kessler helped bring sanity to version 2's
	command layout.  Bill Joy wrote versions 1 and 2.0 through 2.7,
	and created the framework that users see in the present editor.
	Mark Horton added macros and other features and made the editor
	work on a large number of terminals and Unix systems.

o And...
	The financial support of UUNET Communications Services is gratefully
	acknowledged.
