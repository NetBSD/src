=head1 NAME

B<ipfmeta> - use objects in IP filter files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<ipfmeta> [F<options>] [F<objfile>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<ipfmeta> is used to simplify the maintenance of your IP filter
ruleset. It does this through the use of 'objects'.  A matching
object gets replaced by its values at runtime.  This is similar to
what a macro processor like m4 does.

B<ipfmeta> is specifically geared towards IP filter. It is line
oriented, if an object has multiple values, the line with the object
is duplicated and substituted for each value. It is also recursive,
an object may have another object as a value.

Rules to be processed are read from stdin, output goes to stdout.

The verbose option allows for the inclusion of the metarules in the
output as comments.

Definition of the objects and their values is done in a separate
file, the filename defaults to F<ipf.objs>.  An object is delimited
by square brackets. A value is delimited by whitespace.  Comments
start with '#' and end with a newline. Empty lines and extraneous
whitespace are allowed.  A value belongs to the first object that
precedes it.

It is recommended that you use all caps or another distinguishing
feature for object names. You can use B<ipfmeta> for NAT rules also,
for instance to keep them in sync with filter rules.  Combine
B<ipfmeta> with a Makefile to save typing.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-v> I<verboselevel>

Include metarules in output as comments. Default is 1, the top level
metarules. Higher levels cause expanded metarules to be included.
Level 0 does not add comments at all.

=back

=head1 BUGS

A value can not have whitespace in it.
