.Nd mount a shared resource from an SMB/CIFS file server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm

.Op Fl L Ar locale
.Op Fl M Ar crights : Ns Ar srights
.Op Fl N
.Op Fl O Ar cowner : Ns Ar cgroup Ns / Ns Ar sowner : Ns Ar sgroup

.Sm on
.Ar node
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command mounts a share from a remote server using SMB/CIFS protocol.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl E Ar cs1 : Ns Ar cs2
Specifies local
.Pq Ar cs1
and server's
.Pq Ar cs2
character sets.
.It Fl I Ar host
Do not use NetBIOS name resolver and connect directly to
.Ar host ,
which can be either a valid DNS name or an IP address.
.It Fl L Ar locale
Use
.Ar locale
for lower/upper case conversion routines.
Set the locale for case conversion.
By default,
.Nm
tries to use an environment variable
.Ev LC_*
to determine it.
.It Fl M Ar crights : Ns Ar srights
Assign access rights to the newly created connection.
.\" See
.\" .Xr nsmb 8
.\" for theory.
.It Fl N
Do not ask for a password.
At run time,
.Nm
reads the
.Pa ~/.nsmbrc
file for additional configuration parameters and a password.
If no password is found,
.Nm
prompts for it.
.It Fl O Ar cowner : Ns Ar cgroup Ns / Ns Ar sowner : Ns Ar sgroup
Assign owner/group attributes to the newly created connection.
.\" See
.\" .Xr nsmb 8
.\" for theory.
.It Fl R Ar retrycount
How many retries should be done before the SMB requester decides to drop
the connection.
.It Fl T Ar timeout
Timeout in seconds for each request.
.It Fl W Ar workgroup
This option specifies the workgroup to be used in the authentication request.
.It Fl c Ar case
Set a
.Ar case
option which affects name representation.
.Ar case
can be one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width ".Em Value"
.It Em Value
.Em Meaning
.It Cm l
All existing file names are converted to lower case.
Newly created file gets a lower case.
.It Cm u
All existing file names are converted to upper case.
Newly created file gets an upper case.
.El
.It Fl f Ar mode , Fl d Ar mode
Specify permissions that should be assigned to files and directories.
The values must be specified as octal numbers.
Default value for the file mode
is taken from mount point, default value for the directory mode adds execute
permission where the file mode gives read permission.
.Pp
Note that these permissions can differ from the rights granted by SMB
server.
.It Fl u Ar uid , Fl g Ar gid
User ID and group ID assigned to files.
The default are owner and group IDs from
the directory where the volume is mounted.
.It No // Ns Ar user Ns @ Ns Ar server Ns / Ns Ar share
The
.Nm
command will use
.Ar server
as the NetBIOS name of remote computer,
.Ar user
as the remote user name and
.Ar share
as the resource name on a remote server.
If your connections are refused, try using the
.Fl I
option and use a server name of
.Bk -words
.Sq "*SMBSERVER" .
.Ek
.It Ar node
Path to mount point.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width " /etc/nsmb.conf" -compact
.It Pa /etc/nsmb.conf
System wide parameters for smbfs mounts.
.It Pa ~/.nsmbrc
Keeps static parameters for connections and other information.
See
.Pa /usr/share/examples/smbfs/dot.nsmbrc
for details.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example illustrate how to connect to SMB server
.Em SAMBA
as user
.Em GUEST ,
and mount shares
.Em PUBLIC
and
.Em TMP :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mount_smbfs -I samba.mydomain.com //guest@samba/public /smb/public
mount_smbfs -I 192.168.20.3 -E koi8-r:cp866 //guest@samba/tmp /smb/tmp
.Ed
.Pp
If you keep on getting "Connection reset by peer" errors, try:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mount_smbfs -N -I 10.0.0.4 //'*SMBSERVER'/tmp /smb/tmp
.Ed
.Pp
It is possible to use
.Xr fstab 5
for smbfs mounts:
.Pp
.Dl "//guest@samba/public    /smb/public     smbfs  rw,noauto 0   0"
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr smbutil 1 ,
.Xr mount 8
.Sh HISTORY
Support for SMBFS first appeared in
.Fx 4.4 .
It has been ported to
.Nx
and first appeared in
.Nx 2.0 .

.Sh BUGS
The
.Fl E
option works only if you mount with
.Xr rump_smbfs 8
instead of
.Nm .
.Pp
The
.Fl c
option is not implemented yet.
It is silently ignored for now.
