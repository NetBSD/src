.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command mounts a share from a remote server using SMB/CIFS protocol.
.Pp
The options are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl E Ar cs1:cs2
Specifies local
.Ar (cs1)
and server's
.Ar (cs2)
character sets.
.It Fl I Ar host
Do not use NetBIOS name resolver and connect directly to
.Ar host ,
which can be either a valid DNS name or an IP address.
.It Fl L Ar locale
Use
.Ar locale
for lower/upper case conversion routines.
Set the locale for case conversion.
By default
.Nm
tries to use an environment variable
.Ev LC_* 
to determine it.
.It Fl M Ar crights:srights
Assign access rights to the newly created connection.
See
.Xr nsmb 8
for theory.
.It Fl N
Do not ask for a password.
At run time,
.Nm
reads the
.Pa ~/.nsmbrc
file for additional configuration parameters and a password.
If no password is found the
.Nm
prompts for it.
.It Fl O Ar cowner:cgroup/sowner:sgroup
Assign owner/group attributes to the newly created connection.
See
.Xr nsmb 8
for theory.
.It Fl R Ar retrycount
How many retries should be done before the SMB requester decides to drop
the connection.
.It Fl T Ar timeout
Timeout in seconds for each request.
.It Fl W Ar workgroup
This option specifies the workgroup to be used in the authentication request.
.It Fl c Ar case
Set a
.Ar case 
option which affects name representation.
.Ar case 
can be one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width "ValueXX"
.It Em Value
.Em Meaning
.It l
All existing file names converted to lower case. 
Newly created file gets a lower case.
.It u
All existing file names converted to upper case.
Newly created file gets an upper case unde.
.El
.It Fl f Ar mode , Fl d Ar mode
Specify permissions that should be assigned to files and directories.
The values must be specified as octal numbers.
Default value for the file mode
is taken from mount point, default value for the dir mode adds execute
permission where the file mode gives read permission.

Note that these permissions can differ from the rights granted by SMB
server. 
.It Fl u Ar uid , Fl g Ar gid
User id and group id assigned to files.
The default is owner and group id from
directory where the volume is mounted.
.It Ar //user@server/share
The
.Nm
command will use
.Ar server
as the NetBIOS name of remote computer,
.Ar user
as the remote user name and
.Ar share
as the resource name on a remote server.
.It Ar node
Path to mount point.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/log/wtmp -compact
.It Pa ~/.nsmbrc

.Sh EXAMPLES
The following examples illustrate how to connect to a SMB server
.Em SAMBA
as user
.Em GUEST
and mount shares
.Em PUBLIC
and
.Em TMP :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mount_smbfs -I samba.mydomain.com //guest@samba/public /smb/public
mount_smbfs -I 192.168.20.3 -E koi8-r:cp866 //guest@samba/tmp /smb/tmp
.Ed
.Pp
It is possible to use
.Xr fstab 5
for smbfs mounts:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
//guest@samba/public    /smb/public     smbfs  rw,noauto 0   0
