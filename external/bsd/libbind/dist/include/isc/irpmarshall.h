/*! \file
 * \brief
 * Functions to marshall and unmarshall various system data structures. We
 * use a printable ascii format that is as close to various system config
 * files as reasonable (e.g. /etc/passwd format).
 *
 * We are not forgiving with unmarhsalling misformatted buffers. In
 * particular whitespace in fields is not ignored. So a formatted password
 * entry "brister  :1364:100:...." will yield a username of "brister   "
 *
 * We potentially do a lot of mallocs to fill fields that are of type
 * (char **) like a hostent h_addr field. Building (for example) the
 * h_addr field and its associated addresses all in one buffer is
 * certainly possible, but not done here.
 *
 * The following description is true for all the marshalling functions:
 *
 * int irp_marshall_XX(struct yyyy *XX, char **buffer, size_t *len);
 *
 * The argument XX (of type struct passwd for example) is marshalled in the
 * buffer pointed at by *BUFFER, which is of length *LEN. Returns 0
 * on success and -1 on failure. Failure will occur if *LEN is
 * smaller than needed.
 *
 * If BUFFER is NULL, then *LEN is set to the size of the buffer
 * needed to marshall the data and no marshalling is actually done.
 *
 * If *BUFFER is NULL, then a buffer large enough will be allocated
 * with memget() and the size allocated will be stored in *LEN. An extra 2
 * bytes will be allocated for the client to append CRLF if wanted. The
 * value of *LEN will include these two bytes.
 *
 * All the marshalling functions produce a buffer with the fields
 * separated by colons (except for the hostent marshalling, which uses '@'
 * to separate fields). Fields that have multiple subfields (like the
 * gr_mem field in struct group) have their subparts separated by
 * commas.
 *
 * int irp_unmarshall_XX(struct YYYYY *XX, char *buffer);
 *
 * The unmashalling functions break apart the buffer and store the
 * values in the struct pointed to by XX. All pointer values inside
 * XX are allocated with malloc. All arrays of pointers have a NULL
 * as the last element.
