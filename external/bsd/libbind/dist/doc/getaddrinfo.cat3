     The ggeettaaddddrriinnffoo() function is defined for protocol-independent nodename-
     to-address translation.  It performs functionality of gethostbyname(3)
     and getservbyname(3), in more sophisticated manner.

     The addrinfo structure is defined as a result of including the <netdb.h>
     header:

     struct addrinfo {                                                  *
          int     ai_flags;     /* AI_PASSIVE, AI_CANONNAME, AI_NUMERICHOST */
          int     ai_family;    /* PF_xxx */
          int     ai_socktype;  /* SOCK_xxx */
          int     ai_protocol;  /* 0 or IPPROTO_xxx for IPv4 and IPv6 */
          size_t  ai_addrlen;   /* length of ai_addr */
          char   *ai_canonname; /* canonical name for nodename */
          struct sockaddr  *ai_addr; /* binary address */
          struct addrinfo  *ai_next; /* next structure in linked list */
     };

     The _n_o_d_e_n_a_m_e and _s_e_r_v_n_a_m_e arguments are pointers to null-terminated
     strings or NULL.  One or both of these two arguments must be a non-NULL
     pointer.  In the normal client scenario, both the _n_o_d_e_n_a_m_e and _s_e_r_v_n_a_m_e
     are specified.  In the normal server scenario, only the _s_e_r_v_n_a_m_e is spec‐
     ified.  A non-NULL _n_o_d_e_n_a_m_e string can be either a node name or a numeric
     host address string (i.e., a dotted-decimal IPv4 address or an IPv6 hex
     address).  A non-NULL _s_e_r_v_n_a_m_e string can be either a service name or a
     decimal port number.

     The caller can optionally pass an addrinfo structure, pointed to by the
     third argument, to provide hints concerning the type of socket that the
     caller supports.  In this _h_i_n_t_s structure all members other than
     _a_i___f_l_a_g_s, _a_i___f_a_m_i_l_y, _a_i___s_o_c_k_t_y_p_e, and _a_i___p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l must be zero or a NULL
     pointer.  A value of PF_UNSPEC for _a_i___f_a_m_i_l_y means the caller will accept
     any protocol family.  A value of 0 for _a_i___s_o_c_k_t_y_p_e means the caller will
     accept any socket type.  A value of 0 for _a_i___p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l means the caller
     will accept any protocol.  For example, if the caller handles only TCP
     and not UDP, then the _a_i___s_o_c_k_t_y_p_e member of the hints structure should be
     set to SOCK_STREAM when ggeettaaddddrriinnffoo() is called.  If the caller handles
     only IPv4 and not IPv6, then the _a_i___f_a_m_i_l_y member of the _h_i_n_t_s structure
     should be set to PF_INET when ggeettaaddddrriinnffoo() is called.  If the third
     argument to ggeettaaddddrriinnffoo() is a NULL pointer, this is the same as if the
     caller had filled in an addrinfo structure initialized to zero with
     _a_i___f_a_m_i_l_y set to PF_UNSPEC.

     Upon successful return a pointer to a linked list of one or more addrinfo
     structures is returned through the final argument.  The caller can pro‐
     cess each addrinfo structure in this list by following the _a_i___n_e_x_t
     pointer, until a NULL pointer is encountered.  In each returned addrinfo
     structure the three members _a_i___f_a_m_i_l_y, _a_i___s_o_c_k_t_y_p_e, and _a_i___p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l are
     the corresponding arguments for a call to the ssoocckkeett() function.  In each
     addrinfo structure the _a_i___a_d_d_r member points to a filled-in socket
     address structure whose length is specified by the _a_i___a_d_d_r_l_e_n member.

     If the AI_PASSIVE bit is set in the _a_i___f_l_a_g_s member of the _h_i_n_t_s struc‐
     ture, then the caller plans to use the returned socket address structure
     in a call to bbiinndd().  In this case, if the _n_o_d_e_n_a_m_e argument is a NULL
     pointer, then the IP address portion of the socket address structure will
     be set to INADDR_ANY for an IPv4 address or IN6ADDR_ANY_INIT for an IPv6
     address.

     If the AI_PASSIVE bit is not set in the _a_i___f_l_a_g_s member of the _h_i_n_t_s
     structure, then the returned socket address structure will be ready for a
     call to ccoonnnneecctt() (for a connection-oriented protocol) or either
     ccoonnnneecctt(), sseennddttoo(), or sseennddmmssgg() (for a connectionless protocol).  In
     this case, if the _n_o_d_e_n_a_m_e argument is a NULL pointer, then the IP
     address portion of the socket address structure will be set to the loop‐
     back address.

     If the AI_CANONNAME bit is set in the _a_i___f_l_a_g_s member of the _h_i_n_t_s struc‐
     ture, then upon successful return the _a_i___c_a_n_o_n_n_a_m_e member of the first
     addrinfo structure in the linked list will point to a null-terminated
     string containing the canonical name of the specified _n_o_d_e_n_a_m_e.

     If the AI_NUMERICHOST bit is set in the _a_i___f_l_a_g_s member of the _h_i_n_t_s
     structure, then a non-NULL _n_o_d_e_n_a_m_e string must be a numeric host address
     string.  Otherwise an error of EAI_NONAME is returned.  This flag pre‐
     vents any type of name resolution service (e.g., the DNS) from being
     called.

     All of the information returned by ggeettaaddddrriinnffoo() is dynamically allo‐
     cated: the addrinfo structures, and the socket address structures and
     canonical node name strings pointed to by the addrinfo structures.  To
     return this information to the system the function Fn freeaddrinfo is
     called.  The _a_d_d_r_i_n_f_o structure pointed to by the _a_i _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t is freed,
     along with any dynamic storage pointed to by the structure.  This opera‐
     tion is repeated until a NULL _a_i___n_e_x_t pointer is encountered.

     To aid applications in printing error messages based on the EAI_xxx codes
     returned by ggeettaaddddrriinnffoo(), ggaaii__ssttrreerrrroorr() is defined.  The argument is
     one of the EAI_xxx values defined earlier and the return value points to
     a string describing the error.  If the argument is not one of the EAI_xxx
     values, the function still returns a pointer to a string whose contents
     indicate an unknown error.

     Error return status from ggeettaaddddrriinnffoo() is zero on success and non-zero on
     errors.  Non-zero error codes are defined in <netdb.h>, and as follows:

     EAI_ADDRFAMILY  address family for nodename not supported
     EAI_AGAIN       temporary failure in name resolution
     EAI_BADFLAGS    invalid value for ai_flags
     EAI_FAIL        non-recoverable failure in name resolution
     EAI_FAMILY      ai_family not supported
     EAI_MEMORY      memory allocation failure
     EAI_NODATA      no address associated with nodename
     EAI_NONAME      nodename nor servname provided, or not known
     EAI_SERVICE     servname not supported for ai_socktype
     EAI_SOCKTYPE    ai_socktype not supported
     EAI_SYSTEM      system error returned in errno

     If called with proper argument, ggaaii__ssttrreerrrroorr() returns a pointer to a
     string describing the given error code.  If the argument is not one of
     the EAI_xxx values, the function still returns a pointer to a string
     whose contents indicate an unknown error.
