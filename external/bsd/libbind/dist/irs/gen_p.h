 *  Notes:
 *	We hope to create a complete set of thread-safe entry points someday,
 *	which will mean a set of getXbyY() functions that take as an argument
 *	a pointer to the map class, which will have a pointer to the private
 *	data, which will be used preferentially to the static variables that
 *	are necessary to support the "classic" interface.  This "classic"
 *	interface will then be reimplemented as stubs on top of the thread
 *	safe modules, and will keep the map class pointers as their only
 *	static data.  HOWEVER, we are not there yet.  So while we will call
 *	the just-barely-converted map class methods with map class pointers,
 *	right now they probably all still use statics.  We're not fooling
 *	anybody, and we're not trying to (yet).
