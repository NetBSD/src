.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a simple program to compress or uncompress files using LZF
(sometimes known as "Lempel-Ziv Fast") coding.
LZF is extremely fast, about 75% of the performance of
.Xr memcpy 3
for many inputs, while offering a moderate compression ratio,
usually between 1.5:1 and 2:1.
.Pp
When compressing, it removes each input file and replaces it with an
output file with the suffix
.Dq Pa .lzf
appended.
When uncompressing, it removes each input file and replaces it with
an output file with the suffix
.Dq Pa .lzf
removed.
If no files are specified as arguments, standard input and standard
output are used as input and output respectively.
.Pp
If invoked as
.Nm lzf ,
the default mode of operation is to compress.
If invoked as
.Nm unlzf ,
the default mode of operation is to uncompress.
If invoked as
.Nm lzfcat ,
the default mode of operation is to uncompress to standard output.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width width
.It Fl b
This option selects a compression blocksize.
Small compression block sizes give poor compression and slow
operation; the default of 64KiB is strongly recommended.
Block sizes larger than 64KiB are silently reduced to 64KiB in
order to not produce output incompatible with other versions of
.Nm .
.It Fl c
This option selects compression.
.It Fl d
This option selects decompression.
.It Fl f
This option forces overwrite of preexisting output files, if any.
.It Fl h
This option prints command usage.
.It Fl v
This option prints compression statistics for each file processed.

.Xr bzip2 1 ,
.Xr compress 1 ,
.Xr gzip 1 ,
.Xr xz 1
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
program was first included with version 0.1 of Marc Lehmann's LZF library.
It was rewritten for version 2.0 of the library to offer the current
syntax, which is mostly compatible with other compression utilities such
as
.Xr gzip 1 .
The
.Nm
program first appeared in
.Nx 7.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
program was written by
.An Stefan Traby Aq Mt stefan@hello-penguin.com .
.Sh BUGS
Some versions of
.Nm
install a program named
.Dq Pa lzcat
instead of
.Nm lzfcat .
Because the
.Pq lzcat
name is also used by
.Xr xz 1 ,
in
.Nx
the name
.Nm lzfcat
is used instead.
