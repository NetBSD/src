.Sh NAME
.Nm dhcpcd.conf
.Nd dhcpcd configuration file 
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Although
.Nm dhcpcd
can do everything from the command line, there are cases where it's just easier
to do it once in a configuration file.
Most of the options found in
.Xr dhcpcd 8
can be used here.
The first word on the line is the option and the rest of the line is the value.
Leading and trailing whitespace for the option and value are trimmed.
You can escape characters in the value using the \\ character.
.Pp
Blank lines and lines starting with # are ignored.
.Pp
Here's a list of available options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic background
Background immediately.
This is useful for startup scripts which don't disable link messages for
carrier status.
.It Ic blacklist Ar address
Ignores all DHCP messages which have this
.Ar address
as the server ID.
This may be expanded in future releases to ignore all packets
matching either the IP or hardware
.Ar address .
.It Ic clientid Ar string
Send the
.Ar clientid .
If the string is of the format 01:02:03 then it is encoded as hex.
For interfaces whose hardware address is longer than 8 bytes, or if the
.Ar clientid
is an empty string then
.Nm dhcpcd
sends a default
.Ar clientid
of the hardware family and the hardware address.
.It Ic duid
Generate an
.Rs
.%T "RFC 4361"
.Re
compliant clientid.
This requires persistent storage and not all DHCP servers work with it so it's
not enabled by default.
The duid generated will be held in
.Pa @SYSCONFDIR@/dhcpcd.duid
and should not be copied to other hosts.
.It Ic hostname Ar name
Sends specified
.Ar hostname 
to the DHCP server so it can be registered in DNS. If
.Ar hostname
if a FQDN (ie, contains a .) then it will be encoded as such.
.It Ic fqdn Op none | ptr | both
none disables FQDN encoding, ptr just asks the DHCP server to update the PTR
record of the host in DNS whereas both also updates the A record.
The current hostname or the hostname specified using the
.Ic hostname
option must be a FQDN.
.Nm dhcpcd
itself never does any DNS updates.
.Nm dhcpcd
encodes the FQDN hostname as specified in
.Li RFC1035 .
.It Ic interface Ar interface
Subsequent options are only parsed for this
.Ar interface .
.It Ic leasetime Ar seconds
Request a leasetime of
.Ar seconds .
.It Ic noarp
Don't send any ARP requests.
This also disables IPv4LL.
.It Ic nogateway
Don't install any default routes.
.It Ic nohook Ar script
Don't run this hook script.
Matches full name, or prefixed with 2 numbers optionally ending with
.Pa .sh .
.It Ic noipv4ll
Don't attempt to obtain an IPv4LL address if we failed to get one via DHCP.
See
.Rs
.%T "RFC 3927"
.Re
.It Ic nolink
Don't receive link messages about carrier status.
You should only set this for buggy interface drivers.
.It Ic option Ar option
Requests the
.Ar option
from the server.
It can be a variable to be used in
.Xr dhcpcd-run-hooks 8
or the numerical value.
You can specify more options seperated by commas, spaces or more option lines.
.Ic quiet
Supress any dhcpcd output to the console, except for errors.
.It Ic require Ar option
Requires the
.Ar option
to be present in all DHCP messages, otherwise the message is ignored.
It can be a variable to be used in
.Xr dhcpcd-run-hooks 8
or the numerical value.
You can specify more options seperated by commas, spaces or more require lines.
.It Ic script Ar script
Use
.Ar script
instead of the default
.Pa @SCRIPT@ .
.It Ic timeout Ar seconds
The default timeout for waiting for a DHCP response is 30 seconds which may
be too long or too short and can be changed here.
.It Ic userclass Ar string
Tag the DHCP messages with the userclass.
You can specify more than one.
.It Ic vendor Ar code , Ns Ar value
Add an enscapulated vendor option.
.Ar code
should be between 1 and 254 inclusive.
Examples.
.Pp
Set the vendor option 01 with an IP address.
.D1 vendor 01,192.168.0.2
Set the vendor option 02 with a hex code.
.D1 vendor 02,01:02:03:04:05
Set the vendor option 03 with an IP address as a string.
.D1 vendor 03,\e"192.168.0.2\e"
.It Ic vendorclassid Ar string
Change the default vendorclassid sent from dhcpcd-version.
If not set then none is sent.
