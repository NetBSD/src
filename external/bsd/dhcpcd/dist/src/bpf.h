/*
 * Even though we program the BPF filter should we trust it?
 * On Linux at least there is a window between opening the socket,
 * binding the interface and setting the filter where we receive data.
 * This data is NOT checked OR flushed and IS returned when reading.
 * We have no way of flushing it other than reading these packets!
 * But we don't know if they passed the filter or not ..... so we need
 * to validate each and every packet that comes through ourselves as well.
 * Even if Linux does fix this sorry state, who is to say other kernels
 * don't have bugs causing a similar effect?
 *
 * As such, let's strive to keep the filters just for pattern matching
 * to avoid waking dhcpcd up.
 *
 * If you want to be notified of any packet failing the BPF filter,
 * define BPF_DEBUG below.
