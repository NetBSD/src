/*
 * THIS IS A NASTY HACK THAT SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED
 * Basically we cannot include linux/if.h and net/if.h because
 * they have conflicting structures.
 * Sadly, linux/wireless.h includes linux/if.h all the time.
 * Some kernel-header installs fix this and some do not.
 * This file solely exists for those who do not.
 *
 * We *could* include wireless.h as that is designed for userspace,
 * but that then depends on the correct version of wireless-tools being
 * installed which isn't always the case.
