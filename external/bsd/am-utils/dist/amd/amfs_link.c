   * For example, if the link points to /usr, and /usr is a real ufs
   * filesystem, then the link f/s will use the inherited ufs mntfs,
   * and the end result will be that it will become unmountable.
   *
   * To prevent this, we use a hack: we prepend a dot ('.') to opt_fs if
   * its original value was an absolute path, so that it will never match
   * any other mntfs.
