# amd2netbsd:  convert an amd source tree into a
# netbsd amd source tree, under src/dist,
# based on bind2netbsd by Bernd Ernesti and changes by Simon Burge
#
# Rough instructions for importing new amd release:
#
#	$ cd /some/where/temporary
#	$ tar xpfz /new/amd/release/tar/file
#	$ sh /usr/src/external/bsd/am-utils/dist/amd2netbsd am-utils-6.x.y `pwd`
#	$ cd src/external/bsd/dist/am-utils
#	$ cvs -d cvs.netbsd.org:/cvsroot import -m "Import am-utils 6.x.y" src/external/bsd/am-utils/dist ezk am-utils-6-x-y
#	$ cd ../../../am-utils-6.x.y
#	$ run ./configure
# merge newly generated config.h with /usr/src/usr.sbin/amd/include/config.h
# very carefully, since autoconfig seems to be broken (at least in 6.0.4)
#	$ cd ..
#	$ rm -r src am-utils-6.x.y
#	$ cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/amd
#	$ cvs commit -m "Updated autoconf generated files for am-utils 6.x.y."
#
#	- check makefiles to see if any extra sources have been added.
#	- update distrib/sets if necessary.
