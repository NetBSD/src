Many issues are annotated for difficulty as follows:

 - loc = locality of the issue
    *    single file issue, affects file only, or very few
    **   single module issue, affects several files of one module
    ***  cross-module issue, significantly impacts multiple modules
         and may require substantial changes to internal interfaces
 - exist = difficulty of the existing code in this area
    *    affected code is straightforward and easy to read and change
    **   affected code is somewhat complex, but once you understand
         the design, not particularly difficult to understand
    ***  affected code uses a special, exceptionally tricky design
 - algo = difficulty of the new algorithm to be written
    *    the required logic and code is straightforward
    **   the required logic is somewhat complex and needs a careful design
    ***  the required logic is exceptionally tricky,
         maybe an approach to solve that is not even known yet
 - size = the amount of code to be written or changed
    *    a small number of lines (at most 100, usually much less)
    **   a considerable amount of code (several dozen to a few hundred)
    ***  a large amount of code (many hundreds, maybe thousands)
 - imp = importance of the issue
    *    mostly for completeness
    **   would be nice to have
    ***  issue causes considerable inconvenience

Obviously, as the issues have not been solved yet, these annotations
are mere guesses, and some may be wrong.

- The abort() in bufcat(), html.c, can be triggered via buffmt_includes()
  by running -Thtml -Oincludes on a file containing a long .In argument.

- inside `.Bl -column' phrases, punctuation is handled like normal
  text, e.g. `.Bl -column .It Fl x . Ta ...' should give "-x -."

- inside `.Bl -column' phrases, TERMP_IGNDELIM handling by `Pf'
  is not safe, e.g. `.Bl -column .It Pf a b .' gives "ab."
  but should give "ab ."

- check whether it is correct that `D1' uses INDENT+1;
  does it need its own constant?
  loc *  exist **  algo **  size *  imp **

- prohibit `Nm' from having non-text HEAD children
  (e.g., NetBSD mDNSShared/dns-sd.1)
  (mdoc_html.c and mdoc_term.c `Nm' handlers can be slightly simplified)

- support translated section names
  e.g. x11/scrotwm scrotwm_es.1:21:2: error: NAME section must be first
  that one uses NOMBRE because it is spanish...
  deraadt tends to think that section-dependent macro behaviour
  is a bad idea in the first place, so this may be irrelevant
  loc **  exist **  algo **  size *  imp **

- When there is free text in the SYNOPSIS and that free text contains
  the .Nm macro, groff somehow understands to treat the .Nm as an in-line
  macro, while mandoc treats it as a block macro and breaks the line.
  No idea how the logic for distinguishing in-line and block instances
  should be, needs investigation.

- .%T can have trailing punctuation.  Currently, it puts the trailing
  punctuation into a trailing MDOC_TEXT element inside its own scope.
  That element should rather be outside its scope, such that the
  punctuation does not get underlines.  This is not trivial to
  implement because .%T then needs some features of in_line_eoln() -
  slurp all arguments into one single text element - and one feature
  of in_line() - put trailing punctuation out of scope.
  Found in mount_nfs(8) and exports(5), search for "Appendix".

Several areas can be cleaned up to make mandoc even faster.  These are

- improve hashing mechanism for macros (quite important: performance)

- improve hashing mechanism for characters (not as important)

- the PDF file is HUGE: this can be reduced by using relative offsets

- instead of re-initialising the roff predefined-strings set before each
  parse, create a read-only version the first time and copy it

- We use the input line number at several places to distinguish
  same-line from different-line input.  That plainly doesn't work
  with user-defined macros, leading to random breakage.

- Find better ways to prevent endless loops
  in roff(7) macro and string expansion.

- Finish cleanup of date handling.
  Decide which formats should be recognized where.
  Update both mdoc(7) and man(7) documentation.

- Consider creating some views that will make the database more
  readable from the sqlite3 shell.  Consider using them to
  abstract from the database structure, too.

 - Enable HTTP compression by detecting gzip encoding and filtering
   output through libz.
 - Sandbox (see OpenSSH).
 - Enable caching support via HTTP 304 and If-Modified-Since.
 - Allow for cgi.h to be overridden by CGI environment variables.
   Otherwise, binary distributions will inherit the compile-time
   behaviour, which is not optimal.
 - Have Mac OSX systems automatically disable -static compilation of the
   CGI: -static isn't supported.
