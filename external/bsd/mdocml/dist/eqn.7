.Nm eqn
.Nd eqn language reference for mandoc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm eqn
language is a equation-formatting language.
It is used within
.Xr mdoc 7
and
.Xr man 7
.Ux
manual pages.
This manual describes the subset of the
.Nm
language accepted by the
.Xr mandoc 1
utility.
.Pp
Equations within
.Xr mdoc 7
or
.Xr man 7
are enclosed by the
.Sq EQ
and
.Sq EN
macro tags, whose precise syntax is documented in
.Xr roff 7 .
Equations consist of multi-line equation data.
.Pp
For the time being,
.Xr mandoc 1
reproduces the contents of
.Nm
equations verbatim in its output.
.Pp
The
.Nm
implementation in
.Xr mandoc 1
is

.\" .Sh HISTORY
.\" The tbl utility, a preprocessor for troff, was originally written by M.
.\" E. Lesk at Bell Labs in 1975.
.\" The GNU reimplementation of tbl, part of the groff package, was released
.\" in 1990 by James Clark.
.\" A standalone tbl implementation was written by Kristaps Dzonsons in
.\" 2010.
.\" This formed the basis of the implementation that is part of the
.\" .Xr mandoc 1
.\" utility.
