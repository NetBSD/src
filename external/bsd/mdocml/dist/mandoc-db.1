.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d Ar dir
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility extracts keywords from
.Ux
manuals and indexes them for fast retrieval.
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d Ar dir
The directory into which to write the keyword and index databases.
.It Ar
Read input from zero or more files in
.Xr mdoc 7
or
.Xr man 7
.Ux
manual format.
.El
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
constructs the
.Sx Index Database
and
.Sx Keyword Database
in the current working directory.
.Pp
If fatal parse errors are encountered, the offending file is printed to
stderr, omitted from the index, and the parse continues with the next
input file.
.Ss Index Database
The index database,
.Pa mandoc.index ,
is a
.Xr recno 3
database of nil-terminated filenames (record length is non-zero string
length plus one) passed to
.Nm .
Entries are sequentially-numbered, but the filenames are unordered.
.Ss Keyword Database
The keyword database,
.Pa mandoc.db ,
is a
.Xr btree 3
database of nil-terminated keywords (record length is non-zero string
length plus one) mapping to a 8-byte binary field consisting of the
keyword type and source
.Sx Index Database
record number.
The type, an unsigned 32-bit integer in host order, is one of the
following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Li 0x01
The name of a manual page as given in the NAME section.
.It Li 0x02
A function prototype name as given in the SYNOPSIS section.
.It Li 0x03
A utility name as given in the SYNOPSIS section.
.It Li 0x04
An include file as given in the SYNOPSIS section.
.It Li 0x05
A variable name as given in the SYNOPSIS section.
.El
.Pp
If a value is encountered outside of this range, the database is
corrupt.
.Pp
The latter four bytes are a host-ordered record number within the
.Sx Index Database .
