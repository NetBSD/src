# bind2netbsd:  convert a bind tree into a
# netbsd bind source tree, under src/external/bsd/bind/dist,
# based on bind2netbsd by Bernd Ernesti and changes by Simon Burge
#
# Rough instructions for importing new bind release:
#
#	$ cd /some/where/temporary
#	$ tar xpfz /new/bind/release/tar/file
#	$ sh /usr/src/external/bsd/bind/dist/bind2netbsd bind-9.x.y `pwd`
#	$ cd src/external/bsd/bind/dist
#	$ cvs -d cvs.netbsd.org:/cvsroot import -m "Import bind 9.x.y" src/external/bsd/bind/dist ISC bind-9-x-y
#	$ cd ../../../../../bind-9.x.y
#	$ run ./configure
#	$ run make
#	- use the binclude4netbsd to create and import the new headers in
#	  /usr/src/external/bsd/bind/include
#	- check makefiles to see if any extra sources have been added.
#	- update distrib/sets if necessary.
#
# Note that properly the import message should include a short summary
# of changes since the previous import rather than just "Import bind 9.x.y".
#
