   *LEGACY* BIND 9.10 for Win32 Source Build Instructions. 04-Feb-2014

Building BIND 9.10 on Windows using legacy compilers (up to Visual
Studio 2008) has the following prerequisites:

1) Perl, 2) Visual C++ redistributable object, 3) OpenSSL, and
optionally 4) LibXML2, 5) LibGeoIP, and 6) Readline.
See ..\build.txt for more details on these prerequisites.

If you want to build using Visual C++ 6.0, you'll need some extra
files that are to be found in the Platform SDK (which you will need
to install), namely:

iphlpapi.h
iptypes.h
ipexport.h
iphlpapi.lib

You'll also need an updated Iprtrmib.h - using the VC++6.0 one will
get you some compilation errors. You can just overwrite the old one if
you're not using it for any purposes, and maybe keep a backup of it. 

You can copy the header files under VC98\INCLUDE and the library file
under VC98\LIB. I think you can also put them in a separate directory
and add it to the include search list, but I don't know if that can be
made persistent. 

For building on VC++ 7.0 or more recent, no extra files are required. 

The instructions assume a Visual C++ 6.0 compiler with Visual Studio
and Visual Studio Service Pack 3 or later. It may build and work with
earlier versions but it has not been tested. The binaries may be built
and run on any of the following platforms: NT 4.0 Workstation (SP3 or
later), NT 4.0 Server (SP3 or later), Windows 2000 Professional (SP1
or later), Windows 2000 Server or any kind (SP1 or later), Windows XP,
Windows 2003 Server, Windows Vista, Windows 2008 Server, Windows 7,
Windows 2008 R2 Server, Windows 8, Windows 2012 Server (untested), and
further (untested as not yet available). It will NOT build or run on
Windows 95, Windows 98, etc., or Windows RT platforms.

BUILDING BIND

From the command prompt cd to the win32utils\legacy directory under
the BIND9 root:

  cd bind-9.10.0\win32utils\legacy

If you wish to use nmake from VC++ 6.0 or more recent, run
the BuildAll.bat file:

  BuildAll

This will do the following:
1) Build the gen application in the lib/dns directory.
2) Run the gen application and build the required lib/dns header
   files.
3) Create the Build/Release subdirectory under the root of the BIND
   source tree which will hold the binaries being built.
4) Build the libraries, named, application tools like dig, rndc
   dnssec tools, installer, checkconf and checkzones programs,
   BIND 9 Installer.
5) Copies the release notes and the OpenSSL DLL to the BUILD/Release
   directory.
6) Copies the BIND 9 ARM HTML files and the application HTML files
   to the Build\Release area.

If you wish to use the Visual Studio GUI for building, you can just
run the BuildSetup.bat file:

  BuildSetup
  
This will create or find and copy into place several files which are
necessary for the build to proceed.  It also locates and copies into place
the DLLs for OpenSSL and libxml2.

Use BINDBuild.dsw (also located in the win32utils\legacy directory) to
open the workspace for all of the BIND9 libraries and applications. If
needed Visual Studio will update the workspace (aka solution) and
project files. Note it is known to give slightly incorrect files on VS
2010 or more recent, for instance BINDInstall is not compiled to use
DLLs.  Finally select "Build->Batch Build", click "Select All", then
click "Build".

After the build has completed, run the BuildPost.bat file:

  BuildPost

...which does post-build processing.

Installation is accomplished by running the BINDInstall program. All
DLL's are copied to the Program Files area and all applications
(including BINDInstall which may be necessary for uninstalling BIND 9)
to the bin directory.  If BIND 8 has previously been installed on the
system it must be uninstalled first by running it's own BINDInstall
program.  The BIND 9 installer does not yet do this.

All bugs found, whether in the process of building the application or
running BIND or the tools should be reported to the bind9 bugs email
account at bind9-bugs@isc.org.
