These unit tests for BIND 9 are based on the NetBSD Automated Test Framework 
release 0.17.

To build an external copy of ATF for use by BIND 9:

  $ cd atf-src
  $ configure --prefix=<prefix> --enable-tools --disable-shared
  $ make
  $ make install

Subsequently, specify the ATF prefix when building BIND 9:

  $ configure --with-atf=<prefix>

ATF can also be built automatically during the BIND 9 build,
by specifying --with-atf without an argument:

  $ configure --with-atf

This causes BIND 9 to build ATF in the atf-src directory and
link to it directly.
