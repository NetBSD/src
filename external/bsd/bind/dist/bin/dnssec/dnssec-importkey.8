.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdnssec\-importkey\fR
reads a public DNSKEY record and generates a pair of \&.key/\&.private files\&. The DNSKEY record may be read from an existing \&.key file, in which case a corresponding \&.private file will be generated, or it may be read from any other file or from the standard input, in which case both \&.key and \&.private files will be generated\&.
.PP
The newly\-created \&.private file does
\fInot\fR
contain private key data, and cannot be used for signing\&. However, having a \&.private file makes it possible to set publication (\fB\-P\fR) and deletion (\fB\-D\fR) times for the key, which means the public key can be added to and removed from the DNSKEY RRset on schedule even if the true private key is stored offline\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-f \fIfilename\fR
.RS 4
Zone file mode: instead of a public keyfile name, the argument is the DNS domain name of a zone master file, which can be read from
\fBfile\fR\&. If the domain name is the same as
\fBfile\fR, then it may be omitted\&.
.sp
If
\fBfile\fR
is set to
"\-", then the zone data is read from the standard input\&.
.RE
.PP
\-K \fIdirectory\fR
.RS 4
Sets the directory in which the key files are to reside\&.
.RE
.PP
\-L \fIttl\fR
.RS 4
Sets the default TTL to use for this key when it is converted into a DNSKEY RR\&. If the key is imported into a zone, this is the TTL that will be used for it, unless there was already a DNSKEY RRset in place, in which case the existing TTL would take precedence\&. Setting the default TTL to
0
or
none
removes it\&.
.RE
.PP
\-h
.RS 4
Emit usage message and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-v \fIlevel\fR
.RS 4
Sets the debugging level\&.
.RE
.PP
\-V
.RS 4
Prints version information\&.
.RE
.SH "TIMING OPTIONS"
.PP
Dates can be expressed in the format YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS\&. If the argument begins with a \*(Aq+\*(Aq or \*(Aq\-\*(Aq, it is interpreted as an offset from the present time\&. For convenience, if such an offset is followed by one of the suffixes \*(Aqy\*(Aq, \*(Aqmo\*(Aq, \*(Aqw\*(Aq, \*(Aqd\*(Aq, \*(Aqh\*(Aq, or \*(Aqmi\*(Aq, then the offset is computed in years (defined as 365 24\-hour days, ignoring leap years), months (defined as 30 24\-hour days), weeks, days, hours, or minutes, respectively\&. Without a suffix, the offset is computed in seconds\&. To explicitly prevent a date from being set, use \*(Aqnone\*(Aq or \*(Aqnever\*(Aq\&.
.PP
\-P \fIdate/offset\fR
.RS 4
Sets the date on which a key is to be published to the zone\&. After that date, the key will be included in the zone but will not be used to sign it\&.
.RE
.PP
\-D \fIdate/offset\fR
.RS 4
Sets the date on which the key is to be deleted\&. After that date, the key will no longer be included in the zone\&. (It may remain in the key repository, however\&.)
.RE
.SH "FILES"
.PP
A keyfile can be designed by the key identification
Knnnn\&.+aaa+iiiii
or the full file name
Knnnn\&.+aaa+iiiii\&.key
as generated by
dnssec\-keygen(8)\&.
