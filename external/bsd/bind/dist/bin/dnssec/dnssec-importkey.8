.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdnssec\-importkey\fR
reads a public DNSKEY record and generates a pair of .key/.private files. The DNSKEY record may be read from an existing .key file, in which case a corresponding .private file will be generated, or it may be read from any other file or from the standard input, in which case both .key and .private files will be generated.
.PP
The newly\-created .private file does
\fInot\fR
contain private key data, and cannot be used for signing. However, having a .private file makes it possible to set publication (\fB\-P\fR) and deletion (\fB\-D\fR) times for the key, which means the public key can be added to and removed from the DNSKEY RRset on schedule even if the true private key is stored offline.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-f \fIfilename\fR
.RS 4
Zone file mode: instead of a public keyfile name, the argument is the DNS domain name of a zone master file, which can be read from
\fBfile\fR. If the domain name is the same as
\fBfile\fR, then it may be omitted.
.sp
If
\fBfile\fR
is set to
"\-", then the zone data is read from the standard input.
.RE
.PP
\-K \fIdirectory\fR
.RS 4
Sets the directory in which the key files are to reside.
.RE
.PP
\-L \fIttl\fR
.RS 4
Sets the default TTL to use for this key when it is converted into a DNSKEY RR. If the key is imported into a zone, this is the TTL that will be used for it, unless there was already a DNSKEY RRset in place, in which case the existing TTL would take precedence. Setting the default TTL to
0
or
none
removes it.
.RE
.PP
\-h
.RS 4
Emit usage message and exit.
.RE
.PP
\-v \fIlevel\fR
.RS 4
Sets the debugging level.
.RE
.PP
\-V
.RS 4
Prints version information.

.SH "TIMING OPTIONS"
.PP
Dates can be expressed in the format YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS. If the argument begins with a '+' or '\-', it is interpreted as an offset from the present time. For convenience, if such an offset is followed by one of the suffixes 'y', 'mo', 'w', 'd', 'h', or 'mi', then the offset is computed in years (defined as 365 24\-hour days, ignoring leap years), months (defined as 30 24\-hour days), weeks, days, hours, or minutes, respectively. Without a suffix, the offset is computed in seconds. To explicitly prevent a date from being set, use 'none' or 'never'.
.PP
\-P \fIdate/offset\fR
.RS 4
Sets the date on which a key is to be published to the zone. After that date, the key will be included in the zone but will not be used to sign it.
.RE
.PP
\-D \fIdate/offset\fR
.RS 4
Sets the date on which the key is to be deleted. After that date, the key will no longer be included in the zone. (It may remain in the key repository, however.)
.RE
.SH "FILES"
.PP
A keyfile can be designed by the key identification
\fIKnnnn.+aaa+iiiii\fR
or the full file name
\fIKnnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key\fR
as generated by
dnssec\-keygen(8).
