.SH "NAME"
dnssec-settime \- set the key timing metadata for a DNSSEC key
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

\fBdnssec\-settime\fR [\fB\-f\fR] [\fB\-K\ \fR\fB\fIdirectory\fR\fR] [\fB\-L\ \fR\fB\fIttl\fR\fR] [\fB\-P\ \fR\fB\fIdate/offset\fR\fR] [\fB\-A\ \fR\fB\fIdate/offset\fR\fR] [\fB\-R\ \fR\fB\fIdate/offset\fR\fR] [\fB\-I\ \fR\fB\fIdate/offset\fR\fR] [\fB\-D\ \fR\fB\fIdate/offset\fR\fR] [\fB\-S\ \fR\fB\fIkey\fR\fR] [\fB\-i\ \fR\fB\fIinterval\fR\fR] [\fB\-h\fR] [\fB\-V\fR] [\fB\-v\ \fR\fB\fIlevel\fR\fR] [\fB\-E\ \fR\fB\fIengine\fR\fR] {keyfile}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdnssec\-settime\fR
reads a DNSSEC private key file and sets the key timing metadata as specified by the
\fB\-P\fR,
\fB\-A\fR,
\fB\-R\fR,
\fB\-I\fR, and
\fB\-D\fR
options\&. The metadata can then be used by
\fBdnssec\-signzone\fR
or other signing software to determine when a key is to be published, whether it should be used for signing a zone, etc\&.
.PP
If none of these options is set on the command line, then
\fBdnssec\-settime\fR
simply prints the key timing metadata already stored in the key\&.
.PP
When key metadata fields are changed, both files of a key pair (Knnnn\&.+aaa+iiiii\&.key
and
Knnnn\&.+aaa+iiiii\&.private) are regenerated\&. Metadata fields are stored in the private file\&. A human\-readable description of the metadata is also placed in comments in the key file\&. The private file\*(Aqs permissions are always set to be inaccessible to anyone other than the owner (mode 0600)\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-f
.RS 4
Force an update of an old\-format key with no metadata fields\&. Without this option,
\fBdnssec\-settime\fR
will fail when attempting to update a legacy key\&. With this option, the key will be recreated in the new format, but with the original key data retained\&. The key\*(Aqs creation date will be set to the present time\&. If no other values are specified, then the key\*(Aqs publication and activation dates will also be set to the present time\&.
.RE
.PP
\-K \fIdirectory\fR
.RS 4
Sets the directory in which the key files are to reside\&.
.RE
.PP
\-L \fIttl\fR
.RS 4
Sets the default TTL to use for this key when it is converted into a DNSKEY RR\&. If the key is imported into a zone, this is the TTL that will be used for it, unless there was already a DNSKEY RRset in place, in which case the existing TTL would take precedence\&. If this value is not set and there is no existing DNSKEY RRset, the TTL will default to the SOA TTL\&. Setting the default TTL to
0
or
none
removes it from the key\&.
.RE
.PP
\-h
.RS 4
Emit usage message and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-V
.RS 4
Prints version information\&.
.RE
.PP
\-v \fIlevel\fR
.RS 4
Sets the debugging level\&.
.RE
.PP
\-E \fIengine\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the cryptographic hardware to use, when applicable\&.
.sp
When BIND is built with OpenSSL PKCS#11 support, this defaults to the string "pkcs11", which identifies an OpenSSL engine that can drive a cryptographic accelerator or hardware service module\&. When BIND is built with native PKCS#11 cryptography (\-\-enable\-native\-pkcs11), it defaults to the path of the PKCS#11 provider library specified via "\-\-with\-pkcs11"\&.
.RE
.SH "TIMING OPTIONS"
.PP
Dates can be expressed in the format YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS\&. If the argument begins with a \*(Aq+\*(Aq or \*(Aq\-\*(Aq, it is interpreted as an offset from the present time\&. For convenience, if such an offset is followed by one of the suffixes \*(Aqy\*(Aq, \*(Aqmo\*(Aq, \*(Aqw\*(Aq, \*(Aqd\*(Aq, \*(Aqh\*(Aq, or \*(Aqmi\*(Aq, then the offset is computed in years (defined as 365 24\-hour days, ignoring leap years), months (defined as 30 24\-hour days), weeks, days, hours, or minutes, respectively\&. Without a suffix, the offset is computed in seconds\&. To unset a date, use \*(Aqnone\*(Aq or \*(Aqnever\*(Aq\&.
.PP
\-P \fIdate/offset\fR
.RS 4
Sets the date on which a key is to be published to the zone\&. After that date, the key will be included in the zone but will not be used to sign it\&.
.RE
.PP
\-A \fIdate/offset\fR
.RS 4
Sets the date on which the key is to be activated\&. After that date, the key will be included in the zone and used to sign it\&.
.RE
.PP
\-R \fIdate/offset\fR
.RS 4
Sets the date on which the key is to be revoked\&. After that date, the key will be flagged as revoked\&. It will be included in the zone and will be used to sign it\&.
.RE
.PP
\-I \fIdate/offset\fR
.RS 4
Sets the date on which the key is to be retired\&. After that date, the key will still be included in the zone, but it will not be used to sign it\&.
.RE
.PP
\-D \fIdate/offset\fR
.RS 4
Sets the date on which the key is to be deleted\&. After that date, the key will no longer be included in the zone\&. (It may remain in the key repository, however\&.)
.RE
.PP
\-S \fIpredecessor key\fR
.RS 4
Select a key for which the key being modified will be an explicit successor\&. The name, algorithm, size, and type of the predecessor key must exactly match those of the key being modified\&. The activation date of the successor key will be set to the inactivation date of the predecessor\&. The publication date will be set to the activation date minus the prepublication interval, which defaults to 30 days\&.
.RE
.PP
\-i \fIinterval\fR
.RS 4
Sets the prepublication interval for a key\&. If set, then the publication and activation dates must be separated by at least this much time\&. If the activation date is specified but the publication date isn\*(Aqt, then the publication date will default to this much time before the activation date; conversely, if the publication date is specified but activation date isn\*(Aqt, then activation will be set to this much time after publication\&.
.sp
If the key is being set to be an explicit successor to another key, then the default prepublication interval is 30 days; otherwise it is zero\&.
.sp
As with date offsets, if the argument is followed by one of the suffixes \*(Aqy\*(Aq, \*(Aqmo\*(Aq, \*(Aqw\*(Aq, \*(Aqd\*(Aq, \*(Aqh\*(Aq, or \*(Aqmi\*(Aq, then the interval is measured in years, months, weeks, days, hours, or minutes, respectively\&. Without a suffix, the interval is measured in seconds\&.
.RE
.SH "PRINTING OPTIONS"
.PP
\fBdnssec\-settime\fR
can also be used to print the timing metadata associated with a key\&.
.PP
\-u
.RS 4
Print times in UNIX epoch format\&.
.RE
.PP
\-p \fIC/P/A/R/I/D/all\fR
.RS 4
Print a specific metadata value or set of metadata values\&. The
\fB\-p\fR
option may be followed by one or more of the following letters to indicate which value or values to print:
\fBC\fR
for the creation date,
\fBP\fR
for the publication date,
\fBA\fR
for the activation date,
\fBR\fR
for the revocation date,
\fBI\fR
for the inactivation date, or
\fBD\fR
for the deletion date\&. To print all of the metadata, use
\fB\-p all\fR\&.
