.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdnssec\-keyfromlabel\fR
generates a key pair of files that referencing a key object stored in a cryptographic hardware service module (HSM)\&. The private key file can be used for DNSSEC signing of zone data as if it were a conventional signing key created by
\fBdnssec\-keygen\fR, but the key material is stored within the HSM, and the actual signing takes place there\&.
.PP
The
\fBname\fR
of the key is specified on the command line\&. This must match the name of the zone for which the key is being generated\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-a \fIalgorithm\fR
.RS 4
Selects the cryptographic algorithm\&. The value of
\fBalgorithm\fR
must be one of RSAMD5, RSASHA1, DSA, NSEC3RSASHA1, NSEC3DSA, RSASHA256, RSASHA512, ECCGOST, ECDSAP256SHA256, ECDSAP384SHA384, ED25519 or ED448\&. These values are case insensitive\&.
.sp
If no algorithm is specified, then RSASHA1 will be used by default, unless the
\fB\-3\fR
option is specified, in which case NSEC3RSASHA1 will be used instead\&. (If
\fB\-3\fR
is used and an algorithm is specified, that algorithm will be checked for compatibility with NSEC3\&.)
.sp
Note 1: that for DNSSEC, RSASHA1 is a mandatory to implement algorithm, and DSA is recommended\&.
.sp
Note 2: DH automatically sets the \-k flag\&.
.RE
.PP
\-3
.RS 4
Use an NSEC3\-capable algorithm to generate a DNSSEC key\&. If this option is used and no algorithm is explicitly set on the command line, NSEC3RSASHA1 will be used by default\&.
.RE
.PP
\-E \fIengine\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the cryptographic hardware to use\&.
.sp
When BIND is built with OpenSSL PKCS#11 support, this defaults to the string "pkcs11", which identifies an OpenSSL engine that can drive a cryptographic accelerator or hardware service module\&. When BIND is built with native PKCS#11 cryptography (\-\-enable\-native\-pkcs11), it defaults to the path of the PKCS#11 provider library specified via "\-\-with\-pkcs11"\&.
.RE
.PP
\-l \fIlabel\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the label for a key pair in the crypto hardware\&.
.sp
When
BIND
9 is built with OpenSSL\-based PKCS#11 support, the label is an arbitrary string that identifies a particular key\&. It may be preceded by an optional OpenSSL engine name, followed by a colon, as in "pkcs11:\fIkeylabel\fR"\&.
.sp
When
BIND
9 is built with native PKCS#11 support, the label is a PKCS#11 URI string in the format "pkcs11:\fBkeyword\fR=\fIvalue\fR[;\fBkeyword\fR=\fIvalue\fR;\&.\&.\&.]" Keywords include "token", which identifies the HSM; "object", which identifies the key; and "pin\-source", which identifies a file from which the HSM\*(Aqs PIN code can be obtained\&. The label will be stored in the on\-disk "private" file\&.
.sp
If the label contains a
\fBpin\-source\fR
field, tools using the generated key files will be able to use the HSM for signing and other operations without any need for an operator to manually enter a PIN\&. Note: Making the HSM\*(Aqs PIN accessible in this manner may reduce the security advantage of using an HSM; be sure this is what you want to do before making use of this feature\&.
.RE
.PP
\-n \fInametype\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the owner type of the key\&. The value of
\fBnametype\fR
must either be ZONE (for a DNSSEC zone key (KEY/DNSKEY)), HOST or ENTITY (for a key associated with a host (KEY)), USER (for a key associated with a user(KEY)) or OTHER (DNSKEY)\&. These values are case insensitive\&.
.RE
.PP
\-C
.RS 4
Compatibility mode: generates an old\-style key, without any metadata\&. By default,
\fBdnssec\-keyfromlabel\fR
will include the key\*(Aqs creation date in the metadata stored with the private key, and other dates may be set there as well (publication date, activation date, etc)\&. Keys that include this data may be incompatible with older versions of BIND; the
\fB\-C\fR
option suppresses them\&.
.RE
.PP
\-c \fIclass\fR
.RS 4
Indicates that the DNS record containing the key should have the specified class\&. If not specified, class IN is used\&.
.RE
.PP
\-f \fIflag\fR
.RS 4
Set the specified flag in the flag field of the KEY/DNSKEY record\&. The only recognized flags are KSK (Key Signing Key) and REVOKE\&.
.RE
.PP
\-G
.RS 4
Generate a key, but do not publish it or sign with it\&. This option is incompatible with \-P and \-A\&.
.RE
.PP
\-h
.RS 4
Prints a short summary of the options and arguments to
\fBdnssec\-keyfromlabel\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-K \fIdirectory\fR
.RS 4
Sets the directory in which the key files are to be written\&.
.RE
.PP
\-k
.RS 4
Generate KEY records rather than DNSKEY records\&.
.RE
.PP
\-L \fIttl\fR
.RS 4
Sets the default TTL to use for this key when it is converted into a DNSKEY RR\&. If the key is imported into a zone, this is the TTL that will be used for it, unless there was already a DNSKEY RRset in place, in which case the existing TTL would take precedence\&. Setting the default TTL to
0
or
none
removes it\&.
.RE
.PP
\-p \fIprotocol\fR
.RS 4
Sets the protocol value for the key\&. The protocol is a number between 0 and 255\&. The default is 3 (DNSSEC)\&. Other possible values for this argument are listed in RFC 2535 and its successors\&.
.RE
.PP
\-S \fIkey\fR
.RS 4
Generate a key as an explicit successor to an existing key\&. The name, algorithm, size, and type of the key will be set to match the predecessor\&. The activation date of the new key will be set to the inactivation date of the existing one\&. The publication date will be set to the activation date minus the prepublication interval, which defaults to 30 days\&.
.RE
.PP
\-t \fItype\fR
.RS 4
Indicates the use of the key\&.
\fBtype\fR
must be one of AUTHCONF, NOAUTHCONF, NOAUTH, or NOCONF\&. The default is AUTHCONF\&. AUTH refers to the ability to authenticate data, and CONF the ability to encrypt data\&.
.RE
.PP
\-v \fIlevel\fR
.RS 4
Sets the debugging level\&.
.RE
.PP
\-V
.RS 4
Prints version information\&.
.RE
.PP
\-y
.RS 4
Allows DNSSEC key files to be generated even if the key ID would collide with that of an existing key, in the event of either key being revoked\&. (This is only safe to use if you are sure you won\*(Aqt be using RFC 5011 trust anchor maintenance with either of the keys involved\&.)
.RE
.SH "TIMING OPTIONS"
.PP
Dates can be expressed in the format YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS\&. If the argument begins with a \*(Aq+\*(Aq or \*(Aq\-\*(Aq, it is interpreted as an offset from the present time\&. For convenience, if such an offset is followed by one of the suffixes \*(Aqy\*(Aq, \*(Aqmo\*(Aq, \*(Aqw\*(Aq, \*(Aqd\*(Aq, \*(Aqh\*(Aq, or \*(Aqmi\*(Aq, then the offset is computed in years (defined as 365 24\-hour days, ignoring leap years), months (defined as 30 24\-hour days), weeks, days, hours, or minutes, respectively\&. Without a suffix, the offset is computed in seconds\&. To explicitly prevent a date from being set, use \*(Aqnone\*(Aq or \*(Aqnever\*(Aq\&.
.PP
\-P \fIdate/offset\fR
.RS 4
Sets the date on which a key is to be published to the zone\&. After that date, the key will be included in the zone but will not be used to sign it\&. If not set, and if the \-G option has not been used, the default is "now"\&.
.RE
.PP
\-A \fIdate/offset\fR
.RS 4
Sets the date on which the key is to be activated\&. After that date, the key will be included in the zone and used to sign it\&. If not set, and if the \-G option has not been used, the default is "now"\&.
.RE
.PP
\-R \fIdate/offset\fR
.RS 4
Sets the date on which the key is to be revoked\&. After that date, the key will be flagged as revoked\&. It will be included in the zone and will be used to sign it\&.
.RE
.PP
\-I \fIdate/offset\fR
.RS 4
Sets the date on which the key is to be retired\&. After that date, the key will still be included in the zone, but it will not be used to sign it\&.
.RE
.PP
\-D \fIdate/offset\fR
.RS 4
Sets the date on which the key is to be deleted\&. After that date, the key will no longer be included in the zone\&. (It may remain in the key repository, however\&.)
.RE
.PP
\-i \fIinterval\fR
.RS 4
Sets the prepublication interval for a key\&. If set, then the publication and activation dates must be separated by at least this much time\&. If the activation date is specified but the publication date isn\*(Aqt, then the publication date will default to this much time before the activation date; conversely, if the publication date is specified but activation date isn\*(Aqt, then activation will be set to this much time after publication\&.
.sp
If the key is being created as an explicit successor to another key, then the default prepublication interval is 30 days; otherwise it is zero\&.
.sp
As with date offsets, if the argument is followed by one of the suffixes \*(Aqy\*(Aq, \*(Aqmo\*(Aq, \*(Aqw\*(Aq, \*(Aqd\*(Aq, \*(Aqh\*(Aq, or \*(Aqmi\*(Aq, then the interval is measured in years, months, weeks, days, hours, or minutes, respectively\&. Without a suffix, the interval is measured in seconds\&.
.RE
.SH "GENERATED KEY FILES"
.PP
When
\fBdnssec\-keyfromlabel\fR
completes successfully, it prints a string of the form
Knnnn\&.+aaa+iiiii
to the standard output\&. This is an identification string for the key files it has generated\&.
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
nnnn
is the key name\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3

aaa
is the numeric representation of the algorithm\&.
.RE

.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3

iiiii
is the key identifier (or footprint)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdnssec\-keyfromlabel\fR
creates two files, with names based on the printed string\&.
Knnnn\&.+aaa+iiiii\&.key
contains the public key, and
Knnnn\&.+aaa+iiiii\&.private
contains the private key\&.
.PP
The
\&.key
file contains a DNS KEY record that can be inserted into a zone file (directly or with a $INCLUDE statement)\&.
.PP
The
\&.private
file contains algorithm\-specific fields\&. For obvious security reasons, this file does not have general read permission\&.
