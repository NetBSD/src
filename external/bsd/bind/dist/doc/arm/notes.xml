  <section xml:id="root_key"><info><title>New DNSSEC Root Key</title></info>
    <para>
      ICANN is in the process of introducing a new Key Signing Key (KSK) for
      the global root zone. BIND has multiple methods for managing DNSSEC
      trust anchors, with somewhat different behaviors. If the root
      key is configured using the <command>managed-keys</command>
      statement, or if the pre-configured root key is enabled by using
      <command>dnssec-validation auto</command>, then BIND can keep
      keys up to date automatically. Servers configured in this way
      will roll seamlessly to the new key when it is published in
      the root zone. However, keys configured using the
      <command>trusted-keys</command> statement are not automatically
      maintained. If your server is performing DNSSEC validation
      and is configured using <command>trusted-keys</command>, you are
      advised to change your configuration before the root zone begins
      signing with the new KSK. This is currently scheduled for
      October 11, 2017.
    </para>

      This release includes an updated version of the
      <filename>bind.keys</filename> file containing the new root
