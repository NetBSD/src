Functional enhancements from prior major releases of BIND 9

BIND 9.9.0

BIND 9.9.0 includes a number of changes from BIND 9.8 and earlier
releases. New features include:

  * Inline signing, allowing automatic DNSSEC signing of master zones
    without modification of the zonefile, or "bump in the wire" signing in
    slaves.
  * NXDOMAIN redirection.
  * New 'rndc flushtree' command clears all data under a given name from
    the DNS cache.
  * New 'rndc sync' command dumps pending changes in a dynamic zone to
    disk without a freeze/thaw cycle.
  * New 'rndc signing' command displays or clears signing status records
    in 'auto-dnssec' zones.
  * NSEC3 parameters for 'auto-dnssec' zones can now be set prior to
    signing, eliminating the need to initially sign with NSEC.
  * Startup time improvements on large authoritative servers.
  * Slave zones are now saved in raw format by default.
  * Several improvements to response policy zones (RPZ).
  * Improved hardware scalability by using multiple threads to listen for
    queries and using finer-grained client locking
  * The 'also-notify' option now takes the same syntax as 'masters', so it
    can used named masterlists and TSIG keys.
  * 'dnssec-signzone -D' writes an output file containing only DNSSEC
    data, which can be included by the primary zone file.
  * 'dnssec-signzone -R' forces removal of signatures that are not expired
    but were created by a key which no longer exists.
  * 'dnssec-signzone -X' allows a separate expiration date to be specified
    for DNSKEY signatures from other signatures.
  * New '-L' option to dnssec-keygen, dnssec-settime, and
    dnssec-keyfromlabel sets the default TTL for the key.
  * dnssec-dsfromkey now supports reading from standard input, to make it
    easier to convert DNSKEY to DS.
  * RFC 1918 reverse zones have been added to the empty-zones table per
    RFC 6303.
  * Dynamic updates can now optionally set the zone's SOA serial number to
    the current UNIX time.
  * DLZ modules can now retrieve the source IP address of the querying
    client.
  * 'request-ixfr' option can now be set at the per-zone level.
  * 'dig +rrcomments' turns on comments about DNSKEY records, indicating
    their key ID, algorithm and function
  * Simplified nsupdate syntax and added readline support

BIND 9.8.0

BIND 9.8.0 includes a number of changes from BIND 9.7 and earlier
releases. New features include:

  * Built-in trust anchor for the root zone, which can be switched on via
    "dnssec-validation auto;"
  * Support for DNS64.
  * Support for response policy zones (RPZ).
  * Support for writable DLZ zones.
  * Improved ease of configuration of GSS/TSIG for interoperability with
    Active Directory
  * Support for GOST signing algorithm for DNSSEC.
  * Removed RTT Banding from server selection algorithm.
  * New "static-stub" zone type.
  * Allow configuration of resolver timeouts via "resolver-query-timeout"
    option.
  * The DLZ "dlopen" driver is now built by default.
  * Added a new include file with function typedefs for the DLZ "dlopen"
    driver.
  * Made "--with-gssapi" default.
  * More verbose error reporting from DLZ LDAP.

BIND 9.7.0

BIND 9.7.0 includes a number of changes from BIND 9.6 and earlier
releases. Most are intended to simplify DNSSEC configuration. New features
include:

  * Fully automatic signing of zones by "named".
  * Simplified configuration of DNSSEC Lookaside Validation (DLV).
  * Simplified configuration of Dynamic DNS, using the "ddns-confgen"
    command line tool or the "local" update-policy option. (As a side
    effect, this also makes it easier to configure automatic zone
    re-signing.)
  * New named option "attach-cache" that allows multiple views to share a
    single cache.
  * DNS rebinding attack prevention.
  * New default values for dnssec-keygen parameters.
  * Support for RFC 5011 automated trust anchor maintenance
  * Smart signing: simplified tools for zone signing and key maintenance.
  * The "statistics-channels" option is now available on Windows.
  * A new DNSSEC-aware libdns API for use by non-BIND9 applications
  * On some platforms, named and other binaries can now print out a stack
    backtrace on assertion failure, to aid in debugging.
  * A "tools only" installation mode on Windows, which only installs dig,
    host, nslookup and nsupdate.
  * Improved PKCS#11 support, including Keyper support and explicit
    OpenSSL engine selection.

BIND 9.6.0

  * Full NSEC3 support
  * Automatic zone re-signing
  * New update-policy methods tcp-self and 6to4-self
  * The BIND 8 resolver library, libbind, has been removed from the BIND 9
    distribution and is now available as a separate download.
  * Change the default pid file location from /var/run to /var/run/
    {named,lwresd} for improved chroot/setuid support.

BIND 9.5.0

  * GSS-TSIG support (RFC 3645).
  * DHCID support.
  * Experimental http server and statistics support for named via xml.
  * More detailed statistics counters including those supported in BIND 8.
  * Faster ACL processing.
  * Use Doxygen to generate internal documentation.
  * Efficient LRU cache-cleaning mechanism.
  * NSID support.

BIND 9.4.0

  * Implemented "additional section caching (or acache)", an internal
    cache framework for additional section content to improve response
    performance. Several configuration options were provided to control
    the behavior.
  * New notify type 'master-only'. Enable notify for master zones only.
  * Accept 'notify-source' style syntax for query-source.
  * rndc now allows addresses to be set in the server clauses.
  * New option "allow-query-cache". This lets "allow-query" be used to
    specify the default zone access level rather than having to have every
    zone override the global value. "allow-query-cache" can be set at both
    the options and view levels. If "allow-query-cache" is not set then
    "allow-recursion" is used if set, otherwise "allow-query" is used if
    set unless "recursion no;" is set in which case "none;" is used,
    otherwise the default (localhost; localnets;) is used.
  * rndc: the source address can now be specified.
  * ixfr-from-differences now takes master and slave in addition to yes
    and no at the options and view levels.
  * Allow the journal's name to be changed via named.conf.
  * 'rndc notify zone [class [view]]' resend the NOTIFY messages for the
    specified zone.
  * 'dig +trace' now randomly selects the next servers to try. Report if
    there is a bad delegation.
  * Improve check-names error messages.
  * Make public the function to read a key file, dst_key_read_public().
  * dig now returns the byte count for axfr/ixfr.
  * allow-update is now settable at the options / view level.
  * named-checkconf now checks the logging configuration.
  * host now can turn on memory debugging flags with '-m'.
  * Don't send notify messages to self.
  * Perform sanity checks on NS records which refer to 'in zone' names.
  * New zone option "notify-delay". Specify a minimum delay between sets
    of NOTIFY messages.
  * Extend adjusting TTL warning messages.
  * Named and named-checkzone can now both check for non-terminal wildcard
    records.
  * "rndc freeze/thaw" now freezes/thaws all zones.
  * named-checkconf now check acls to verify that they only refer to
    existing acls.
  * The server syntax has been extended to support a range of servers.
  * Report differences between hints and real NS rrset and associated
    address records.
  * Preserve the case of domain names in rdata during zone transfers.
  * Restructured the data locking framework using architecture dependent
    atomic operations (when available), improving response performance on
    multi-processor machines significantly. x86, x86_64, alpha, powerpc,
    and mips are currently supported.
  * UNIX domain controls are now supported.
  * Add support for additional zone file formats for improving loading
    performance. The masterfile-format option in named.conf can be used to
    specify a non-default format. A separate command named-compilezone was
    provided to generate zone files in the new format. Additionally, the
    -I and -O options for dnssec-signzone specify the input and output
    formats.
  * dnssec-signzone can now randomize signature end times (dnssec-signzone
    -j jitter).
  * Add support for CH A record.
  * Add additional zone data constancy checks. named-checkzone has
    extended checking of NS, MX and SRV record and the hosts they
    reference. named has extended post zone load checks. New zone options:
    check-mx and integrity-check.
  * edns-udp-size can now be overridden on a per server basis.
  * dig can now specify the EDNS version when making a query.
  * Added framework for handling multiple EDNS versions.
  * Additional memory debugging support to track size and mctx arguments.
  * Detect duplicates of UDP queries we are recursing on and drop them.
    New stats category "duplicates".
  * "USE INTERNAL MALLOC" is now runtime selectable.
  * The lame cache is now done on a basis as some servers only appear to
    be lame for certain query types.
  * Limit the number of recursive clients that can be waiting for a single
    query () to resolve. New options clients-per-query and
    max-clients-per-query.
  * dig: report the number of extra bytes still left in the packet after
    processing all the records.
  * Support for IPSECKEY rdata type.
  * Raise the UDP recieve buffer size to 32k if it is less than 32k.
  * x86 and x86_64 now have seperate atomic locking implementations.
  * named-checkconf now validates update-policy entries.
  * Attempt to make the amount of work performed in a iteration self
    tuning. The covers nodes clean from the cache per iteration, nodes
    written to disk when rewriting a master file and nodes destroyed per
    iteration when destroying a zone or a cache.
  * ISC string copy API.
  * Automatic empty zone creation for D.F.IP6.ARPA and friends. Note: RFC
    1918 zones are not yet covered by this but are likely to be in a
    future release.
  * New options: empty-server, empty-contact, empty-zones-enable and
    disable-empty-zone.
  * dig now has a '-q queryname' and '+showsearch' options.
  * host/nslookup now continue (default)/fail on SERVFAIL.
  * dig now warns if 'RA' is not set in the answer when 'RD' was set in
    the query. host/nslookup skip servers that fail to set 'RA' when 'RD'
    is set unless a server is explicitly set.
  * Integrate contibuted DLZ code into named.
  * Integrate contibuted IDN code from JPNIC.
  * libbind: corresponds to that from BIND 8.4.7.

BIND 9.3.0

  * DNSSEC is now DS based (RFC 3658).
  * DNSSEC lookaside validation.
  * check-names is now implemented.
  * rrset-order is more complete.
  * IPv4/IPv6 transition support, dual-stack-servers.
  * IXFR deltas can now be generated when loading master files,
    ixfr-from-differences.
  * It is now possible to specify the size of a journal, max-journal-size.
  * It is now possible to define a named set of master servers to be used
    in masters clause, masters.
  * The advertised EDNS UDP size can now be set, edns-udp-size.
  * allow-v6-synthesis has been obsoleted.
  * Zones containing MD and MF will now be rejected.
  * dig, nslookup name. now report "Not Implemented" as NOTIMP rather than
    NOTIMPL. This will have impact on scripts that are looking for
    NOTIMPL.
  * libbind: corresponds to that from BIND 8.4.5.

BIND 9.2.0

  * The size of the cache can now be limited using the "max-cache-size"
    option.
  * The server can now automatically convert RFC1886-style recursive
    lookup requests into RFC2874-style lookups, when enabled using the new
    option "allow-v6-synthesis". This allows stub resolvers that support
    AAAA records but not A6 record chains or binary labels to perform
    lookups in domains that make use of these IPv6 DNS features.
  * Performance has been improved.
  * The man pages now use the more portable "man" macros rather than the
    "mandoc" macros, and are installed by "make install".
  * The named.conf parser has been completely rewritten. It now supports
    "include" directives in more places such as inside "view" statements,
    and it no longer has any reserved words.
  * The "rndc status" command is now implemented.
  * rndc can now be configured automatically.
  * A BIND 8 compatible stub resolver library is now included in lib/bind.
  * OpenSSL has been removed from the distribution. This means that to use
    DNSSEC, OpenSSL must be installed and the --with-openssl option must
    be supplied to configure. This does not apply to the use of TSIG,
    which does not require OpenSSL.
  * The source distribution now builds on Windows. See win32utils/
    readme1.txt and win32utils/win32-build.txt for details.
  * This distribution also includes a new lightweight stub resolver
    library and associated resolver daemon that fully support forward and
    reverse lookups of both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. This library is
    considered experimental and is not a complete replacement for the BIND
    8 resolver library. Applications that use the BIND 8 res_* functions
    to perform DNS lookups or dynamic updates still need to be linked
    against the BIND 8 libraries. For DNS lookups, they can also use the
    new "getrrsetbyname()" API.
  * BIND 9.2 is capable of acting as an authoritative server for DNSSEC
    secured zones. This functionality is believed to be stable and
    complete except for lacking support for verifications involving
    wildcard records in secure zones.
  * When acting as a caching server, BIND 9.2 can be configured to perform
    DNSSEC secure resolution on behalf of its clients. This part of the
    DNSSEC implementation is still considered experimental. For detailed
    information about the state of the DNSSEC implementation, see the file
    doc/misc/dnssec.
