TODO list as of zkt-1.1

zkt-ls:
 feat	option to specify the key age as remaining lifetime
	(Option -i inverse age ?).

zkt-signer:
 bug	Distribute_Cmd wouldn't work properly on dynamic zones
 	(missing freeze, thaw; copy Keyfiles instead of signed zone file)

 bug	Automatic KSK rollover of dynamic zones will only work if the parent
 	uses the standard name for the signed zonefile (zonefile.db.signed).

 bug	Phase3 of manual ksk rollover do not trigger a resigning of the zone
 	(Key removal is not recognized by dosigning () function )

 bug	There is no online checking of the key material by design.
 	The signer command checks the status of the key as they
	are represented in the file system and not in the zone.
	The dnssec maintainer is responsible for the lifeliness of the
	data in the hosted domain.
	In other words: It's highly recommended to use the
	option -r when you use zkt-signer on a production zone.
	Than the time of propagation is (more or less) equal to the timestamp
	of the zone.db.signed file.

zkt-rollover:
 feat	New command to roll keys independent of zone signing
	(Usefull for dynamic zones managed by BIND9.7)

dki:
 feat	Use dynamic memory for dname in dki_t
