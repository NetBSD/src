Nominum dnsperf 2.1.0.0
Release Notes
************************
 
December 15, 2015

In addition to various bug fixes, the following new capabilities
were added in this release:

 - The -C option was added to resperf. This option enables the local
   server to act as multiple clients.  By default, the local server
   acts as a single client.

 - the -T option was added to dnsperf. This option separates the
   number of clients from the number of threads and allows more
   clients to be simulated effectively.  Note that using this option
   impacts CPU and memory, so we recommend limiting the number of
   threads.

Nominum dnsperf 2.0.0.0
March 1, 2012
 
In the dnsperf command, the following changes occurred:

 - The socket buffer size is no longer set to 32 kilobytes by default.

 - A new -c clients option was added to enable the server to act as 
   multiple clients. Each client uses the same source IP address with a 
   unique source port. Use the "clients" argument to specify the number of 
   clients represented by the server. We recommend limiting the number of 
   clients represented by the server because the dnsperf process uses two  
   threads for each client (one thread for sent packets and one for 
   received packets), which impacts CPU and memory. 

 - Example query files are no longer included with the dnsperf program.  
   Nominum provides a sample query file that is available for download at:
   ftp://ftp.nominum.com/pub/nominum/dnsperf/data/

 - Latency reporting improved. When the -v (verbose mode) option is 
   configured with the dnsperf command, the command output now includes 
   latency measurements and the DNS RCODE of each response. This enables 
   users to create their own latency graphs.

 - Performance was enhanced on modern operating systems so that faster 
   name servers can be tested.

 - The dnsperf command output is enhanced to display more information in a 
   compact format.

The following options were removed from the dnsperf command:

 - The -A option for displaying command line arguments passed to the 
   dnsperf tool in the final statistics output. Now, the dnsperf command
   output always displays command line arguments.

 - The -T option for printing a histogram showing response latency after 
   completing a test run. Now, the -v option enables users to include 
   latency measurements in the dnsperf command output.

 - The -H option for configuring the number of buckets for which response 
   latency is displayed. Now, the -v option enables users to include
   latency measurements in the dnsperf command output.

 - The -1 option for configuring the dnsperf tool to run through the input 
   file exactly one time. (Now, you use the -n 1 option to configure the 
   dnsperf tool to run through the input file one time.)

 - The -c option for including the number of responses received (for 
   each DNS RCODE) in the final statistics output. Now, DNS RCODE responses 
   are always reported.

In the resperf command, the following changes occurred:
 
 - The socket buffer size is no longer set to 32 kilobytes by default.

 - The -A option, which displayed command line arguments passed to the 
   resperf tool in the final statistics output, was removed. Now, the 
   resperf command output always displays command line arguments.

Nominum dnsperf 1.0.2.0
December 22, 2011

This release adds support for RHEL6-64 and for Solaris 10 x86-64.

Some new configuration options have been added. You can now specify:

	- the local port from which to send requests
	- the local address from which to send requests
	- the maximum number of runs through the input file, up
	  to the timeout limit.
	- when using TSIG, algorithms other than hmac-md5 can be used.

One default has been changed:

	- The maximum number of outstanding requests now defaults
	  to 100.

A new example query file for IPv6, queryfile-example-ipv6, is now
included with the distribution.


-----------------------
Nominum dnsperf 1.0.1.0
January 10, 2008

This release makes binary builds of dnsperf available in addition to
the source code version previously released.

This release of dnsperf includes a sample query file containing
100,000 queries to help with performance testing.  This query file is
useful for checking latencies or a continuous dnsperf run. In the
binary distribution, this file is found at:

	/usr/local/nom/examples/dnsperf/queryfile-example-100thousand

In the source distribution, it is at:

	./examples/queryfile-example-100thousand

where "." is the directory made by extracting the source tarball.

Nominum recommends using a query file with at least 3 million queries
for a full resperf run as described in the man page; we make such a
file available for download at:

ftp://ftp.nominum.com/pub/nominum/dnsperf/data/queryfile-example-3million.gz

The following fix is included in the source distribution:

 - 20996: makefile.in does not allow overriding mandir

   The --mandir argument to configure, which allows the user to
   specify the location man pages are installed, was incorrectly
   ignored.

"queryparse" is a contributed program available in the source
distribution of dnsperf. It can be found at contrib/queryparse/.
The following changes were made to that program:

 - 19717: contrib/queryparse includes outgoing queries

   The queryparse script had no way of distinguishing between incoming
   queries and outgoing queries when applied to a traffic trace from a
   caching server. This was addressed by adding a new flag (-r) that,
   when included in the command line, will keep queries with
   RD=0. Otherwise, it will default to discarding them.
   
 - The ability to parse responses instead of queries was added.

 - A check was added to avoid short packets.

 - Logic was added to detect link type and correctly set the initial
   offset to handle both Ethernet and Cisco HDLC frames.

 - Queryparse now uses pcapy instead of the btk python libcap module.

Note that announcements of new releases of dnsperf are sent to the
mailing list: dnsperf-announce@nominum.com.  To be added to the
mailing list, send a message to dnsperf-announce-request@nominum.com
with "subscribe" as the subject.

Known Issues:

  - None.

-----------------------
Nominum dnsperf 1.0.0.1
December 21, 2006

This release addresses the following issue in the dnsperf program:

  - 18838/18782: dnsperf slow down issue

    Because of an error in how timeout checking was being done, queries
    were rarely timing out, so the number of valid queries in flight kept
    dropping.  This error has been corrected.
