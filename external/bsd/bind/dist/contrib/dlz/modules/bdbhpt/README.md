dlz-bdbhpt-dynamic
==================

A Bind 9 Dynamically Loadable BerkeleyDB High Performance Text Driver

Summary
-------

This is an attempt to port the original Bind 9 DLZ bdbhpt_driver.c as
found in the Bind 9 source tree into the new DLZ dlopen driver API.
The goals of this project are as follows:

* Provide DLZ facilities to OEM-supported Bind distributions
* Support both v1 (Bind 9.8) and v2 (Bind 9.9) of the dlopen() DLZ API

Requirements
------------

You will need the following:
 * Bind 9.8 or higher with the DLZ dlopen driver enabled
 * BerkeleyDB libraries and header files
 * A C compiler

This distribution have been successfully installed and tested on
Ubuntu 12.04.

Installation
------------

With the above requirements satisfied perform the following steps:

1. Ensure the symlink for dlz_minimal.h points at the correct header
   file matching your Bind version
2. Run: make
3. Run: sudo make install # this will install dlz_bdbhpt_dynamic.so
   into /usr/lib/bind9/
4. Add a DLZ statement similar to the example shown in
   example/dlz.conf into your Bind configuration
5. Ensure your BerkeleyDB home-directory exists and can be written to
   by the bind user
6. If you're running an AppArmor enabled Bind, consider adding content
   included within example/apparmor.d-local-usr.sbin.named within
   /etc/apparmor.d/local/usr.sbin.named
7. Use the included testing/bdbhpt-populate.pl script to provide some
   data for initial testing

Usage
-----

Example usage is as follows:

```
dlz "bdbhpt_dynamic" {
        database "dlopen /usr/lib/bind9/dlz_bdbhpt_dynamic.so T /var/cache/bind/dlz dnsdata.db";
};
```

The arguments for the "database" line above are as follows:

1. dlopen - Use the dlopen DLZ driver to dynamically load our compiled
   driver
2. The full path to your built dlz_bdbhpt_dynamic.so
3. Single character specifying the mode to open your BerkeleyDB
   environment:
   * T - Transactional Mode - Highest safety, lowest speed.
   * C - Concurrent Mode - Lower safety (no rollback), higher speed.
   * P - Private Mode - No interprocess communication & no locking.
     Lowest safety, highest speed.
4. Directory containing your BerkeleyDB - this is where the BerkeleyDB
   environment will be created.
5. Filename within this directory containing your BerkeleyDB tables.

A copy of the above Bind configuration is included within
example/dlz.conf.
