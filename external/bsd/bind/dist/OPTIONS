Setting the STD_CDEFINES environment variable before running configure can
be used to enable certain compile-time options that are not explicitly
defined in configure.

Some of these settings are:

Setting                   Description
                          Don't ovewrite memory when allocating or freeing
-DISC_MEM_FILL=0          it; this improves performance but makes
                          debugging more difficult.
                          Don't track memory allocations by file and line
-DISC_MEM_TRACKLINES=0    number; this improves performance but makes
                          debugging more difficult.
-DISC_FACILITY=LOG_LOCAL0 Change the default syslog facility for named
-DNS_CLIENT_DROPPORT=0    Disable dropping queries from particular
                          well-known ports:
-DCHECK_SIBLING=0         Don't check sibling glue in named-checkzone
-DCHECK_LOCAL=0           Don't check out-of-zone addresses in
                          named-checkzone
-DNS_RUN_PID_DIR=0        Create default PID files in ${localstatedir}/run
                          rather than ${localstatedir}/run/{named,lwresd}/
                          Enable DNSSEC signature chasing support in dig.
-DDIG_SIGCHASE=1          (Note: This feature is deprecated. Use delv
                          instead.)
                          Increase the maximum number of configurable
-DNS_RPZ_MAX_ZONES=64     response policy zones from 32 to 64; this is the
                          highest possible setting
-DISC_HEAP_CHECK          Test heap consistency after every heap
                          operation; used when debugging
