.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B pppdump
utility converts the files written using the \fIrecord\fR option of
.B pppd
into a human-readable format.  If one or more filenames are specified,
.B pppdump
will read each in turn; otherwise it will read its standard input.  In
each case the result is written to standard output.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP
.B \-h
Prints the bytes sent and received in hexadecimal.  If neither this
option nor the \fB\-p\fR option is specified, the bytes are printed as
the characters themselves, with non-printing and non-ASCII characters
printed as escape sequences.
.TP
.B \-p
Collects the bytes sent and received into PPP packets, interpreting
the async HDLC framing and escape characters and checking the FCS
(frame check sequence) of each packet.  The packets are printed as hex
values and as characters (non-printable characters are printed as
`.').
.TP
.B \-d
With the \fB\-p\fR option, this option causes
.B pppdump
to decompress packets which have been compressed with the BSD-Compress
or Deflate methods.
.TP
.B \-r
Reverses the direction indicators, so that `sent' is printed for
bytes or packets received, and `rcvd' is printed for bytes or packets
sent.
.TP
.B \-m \fImru
Use \fImru\fR as the MRU (maximum receive unit) for both directions of
the link when checking for over-length PPP packets (with the \fB\-p\fR
option).
