.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to extract and upgrade packages that have been
previously created with the
.Xr pkg_create 1
command.
Packages are prepared collections of pre-built binaries, documentation,
configurations, installation instructions and/or other files.
.Nm
can recursively install other packages that the current package
depends on or requires from both local disk and via FTP or HTTP.
.Sh WARNING
.Bf -emphasis
Since the
.Nm
command may execute scripts or programs contained within a package file,
your system may be susceptible to
.Dq Trojan horses
or other subtle
attacks from miscreants who create dangerous package files.
.Pp
You are advised to verify the competence and identity of those who
provide installable package files.
For extra protection, use the digital signatures provided where possible
(see the
.Xr pkg_install.conf 5 ) ,
or, failing that, use
.Xr tar 1
to extract the package file, and inspect its contents and scripts
to ensure it poses no danger to your system's integrity.
Pay particular attention to any
.Pa +INSTALL
or
.Pa +DEINSTALL
files, and inspect the
.Pa +CONTENTS
file for
.Cm @cwd ,
.Cm @mode
(check for setuid),
.Cm @dirrm ,
.Cm @exec ,
and
.Cm @unexec
directives, and/or use the
.Xr pkg_info 1
command to examine the package file.
.Ef
.Sh OPTIONS
The following command line arguments are supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar pkg-name [ ... ]
The named packages are installed.
.Nm
will first try to use
.Ar pkg-name
as full URL or path name without any wildcard processing.
If that fails,
.Nm
will try to match packages using wildcard processing.
If that fails as well and
.Ar pkg-name
does not contain any /, the entries of the
.Dv PKG_PATH
variable are searched using the wildcard processing rules.
.It Fl A
Mark package as installed automatically, as dependency of another
package.
You can use
.Dl Ic pkg_admin set automatic=YES
to mark packages this way after installation, and
.Dl Ic pkg_admin unset automatic
to remove the mark.
If you
.Nm
a package without specifying
.Fl A
after it had already been automatically installed, the mark is
removed.
.It Fl f
Force installation to proceed even if prerequisite packages are not
installed or the install script fails.
Although
.Nm
will still try to find and auto-install missing prerequisite packages,
a failure to find one will not be fatal.
This flag also overrides the fatal error when the operating system or
architecture the package was built on differ from that of the host.
.It Fl I
If an installation script exists for a given package, do not execute it.
.It Fl K Ar pkg_dbdir
Set
.Ar pkg_dbdir
as the package database directory.
If this option isn't specified, then the package database directory is
taken from the value of the environment variable
.Ev PKG_DBDIR
if it's set, otherwise it defaults to
.Pa /var/db/pkg .
.It Fl L
Don't add the package to any views after installation.
.It Fl m
Override the machine architecture returned by uname with
.Ar machine .
.It Fl n
Don't actually install a package, just report the steps that
would be taken if it was.
.It Fl P Ar destdir
Prefix all file and directory names with
.Ar destdir .
For packages without install scripts this has the same behavior as
using chroot.
.It Fl p Ar prefix
Set
.Ar prefix
as the directory in which to extract files from a package.
If a package has set its default directory, it will be overridden
by this flag.
Note that only the first
.Cm @cwd
directive will be replaced, since
.Nm
has no way of knowing which directory settings are relative and
which are absolute.
Only one directory transition is supported and the second one is expected to go
into
.Ar pkgdb .
.It Fl R
Do not record the installation of a package.
This implies
.Fl I .
This means that you cannot deinstall it later, so only use this option if
you know what you are doing!
.It Fl u
If the package that's being installed is already installed,
an update is performed.
It is currently not possible to update to an identical version.
If this is specified twice, then any dependent packages that are
too old will also be updated to fulfill the dependency.
See below for a more detailed description of the process.
.It Fl V
Print version number and exit.
.It Fl v
Turn on verbose output.
.It Fl W Ar viewbase
Set
.Ar viewbase
as the base directory for the managed views.
The default
.Ar viewbase
directory is set by
.Xr pkg_view 1 .
This value also may be set from the
.Ev LOCALBASE
environment variable.
.It Fl w Ar view
Set the
.Ar view
to which packages should be added after installation.
The default
.Ar view
is set by
.Xr pkg_view 1 .
This value also may be set from the
.Ev PKG_VIEW
environment variable.
.El
.Pp
One or more
.Ar pkg-name
arguments may be specified, each being either a file containing the
package (these usually ending with the
.Dq .tgz
suffix) or a
URL pointing at a file available on an ftp or web site.
Thus you may extract files directly from their anonymous ftp or WWW
locations (e.g.,
.Nm
ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/i386/3.1_2007Q2/shells/bash-3.2.9.tgz
or
.Nm
http://www.example.org/packages/screen-4.0.tbz).
Note:  For ftp transfers, if you wish to use
.Bf -emphasis
passive mode
.Ef
ftp in such transfers, set the variable
.Bf -emphasis
FTP_PASSIVE_MODE
.Ef
to some value in your environment.
Otherwise, the more standard ACTIVE mode may be used.
If
.Nm
consistently fails to fetch a package from a site known to work,
it may be because you have a firewall that demands the usage of
.Bf -emphasis
passive mode
.Ef
ftp.
.Sh TECHNICAL DETAILS
.Nm
extracts each package's meta data (including the
.Dq packing list )
to memory and then runs through the following sequence to fully extract
the contents of the package:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
A check is made to determine if the package or another version of it
is already recorded as installed.
If it is,
installation is terminated if the
.Fl u
option is not given.
.Pp
If the
.Fl u
option is given, it's assumed the package should be replaced by the
new version instead.
Before doing so, all packages that depend on the
pkg being upgraded are checked if they also work with the new version.
If that test is successful, replacing is prepared by moving an existing
.Pa +REQUIRED_BY
file aside (if it exists), and running
.Xr pkg_delete 1
on the installed package.
Installation then proceeds as if the package
was not installed, and restores the
.Pa +REQUIRED_BY
file afterwards.
.It
The package build information is extracted from the
.Pa +BUILD_INFO
file and compared against the result of
.Xr uname 3 .
If the operating system or architecture of the package differ from
that of the host, installation is aborted.
This behavior is overridable with the
.Fl f
flag.
.It
The package build information from
.Pa +BUILD_INFO
is then checked for
.Ev USE_ABI_DEPENDS=NO
(or
.Ev IGNORE_RECOMMENDED ) .
If the package was built with ABI dependency recommendations ignored,
a warning will be issued.
.It
A check is made to determine if the package conflicts (from
.Cm @pkgcfl
directives, see
.Xr pkg_create 1 )
with an already recorded as installed package or if an installed package
conflicts with the package.
If it is, installation is terminated.
.It
The file list of the package is compared to the file lists of the
installed packages.
If there is any overlap, the installation is terminated.
.It
All package dependencies (from
.Cm @pkgdep
directives, see
.Xr pkg_create 1 )
are read from the packing list.
If any of these required packages are not currently installed,
an attempt is made to find and install it;
if the missing package cannot be found or installed,
the installation is terminated.
If the
.Fl u
option was specified twice, any required packages that are installed,
but which have a version number that is considered to be too old,
are also updated.
The dependent packages are found according to the normal
.Ev PKG_PATH
rules.
.It
If the package contains an
.Ar install
script, it is executed with the following arguments:
.Bl -tag -width indentindent
.It Ar pkg-name
The name of the package being installed.
.It Cm PRE-INSTALL
Keyword denoting that the script is to perform any actions needed before
the package is installed.
.El
.Pp
If the
.Ar install
script exits with a non-zero status code, the installation is terminated.
.It
The files from the file list are extracted to the chosen prefix.
.It
If an
.Ar install
script exists for the package, it is executed with the following arguments:
.Bl -tag -width indentindent
.It Ar pkg_name
The name of the package being installed.
.It Cm POST-INSTALL
Keyword denoting that the script is to perform any actions needed
after the package has been installed.
.El
.It
After installation is complete, a copy of the packing list,
.Ar deinstall
script, description, and display files are copied into
.Pa /var/db/pkg/\*[Lt]pkg-name\*[Gt]
for subsequent possible use by
.Xr pkg_delete 1 .
Any package dependencies are recorded in the other packages'
.Pa /var/db/pkg/\*[Lt]other-pkg\*[Gt]/+REQUIRED_BY
file
(if an alternate package database directory is specified, then it
overrides the
.Pa /var/db/pkg
path shown above).
.It
If the package is a depoted package, then add it to the default view.
.It
Finally, if we were upgrading a package, any
.Pa +REQUIRED_BY
file that was moved aside before upgrading was started is now moved
back into place.
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar install
script is called with the environment variable
.Ev PKG_PREFIX
set to the installation prefix (see the
.Fl p
option above).
This allows a package author to write a script
that reliably performs some action on the directory where the package
is installed, even if the user might change it with the
.Fl p
flag to
.Cm pkg_add .
The scripts are also called with the
.Ev PKG_METADATA_DIR
environment variable set to the location of the
.Pa +*
meta-data files, and with the
.Ev PKG_REFCOUNT_DBDIR
environment variable set to the location of the package reference counts
database directory.
If the
.Fl P
flag was given to
.Nm ,
.Ev PKG_DESTDIR
will be set to
.Ar destdir .
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width PKG_TMPDIR
.It Ev LOCALBASE
This is the location of the
.Ar viewbase
directory in which all the views are managed.
The default
.Ar viewbase
directory is
.Pa /usr/pkg .
.It Ev PKG_DBDIR
If the
.Fl K
flag isn't given, then
.Ev PKG_DBDIR
is the location of the package database directory.
The default package database directory is
.Pa /var/db/pkg .
.It Ev PKG_PATH
The value of the
.Ev PKG_PATH
variable overrides the
.Xr pkg_install.conf 5
variable of the same name.
It is used if a given package can't be found, it's usually set to
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc/packages/All .
The environment variable
should be a series of entries separated by semicolons.
Each entry consists of a directory name or URL.
The current directory may be indicated implicitly by an empty directory
name, or explicitly by a single period.
.It Ev PKG_REFCOUNT_DBDIR
Location of the package reference counts database directory.
The default location is the path to the package database directory with
.Dq .refcount
appended to the path, e.g.
.Pa /var/db/pkg.refcount .
.It Ev PKG_VIEW
The default view can be specified in the
.Ev PKG_VIEW
environment variable.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
In all cases,
.Nm
will try to install binary packages listed in dependencies list.
.Pp
You can specify a compiled binary package explicitly on the command line.
.Bd -literal
# pkg_add /usr/pkgsrc/packages/All/tcsh-6.14.00.tgz
.Ed
.Pp
If you omit the version number,
.Nm
will install the latest version available.
With
.Fl v ,
.Nm
emits more messages to terminal.
.Bd -literal
# pkg_add -v /usr/pkgsrc/packages/All/unzip
.Ed
.Pp
You can grab a compiled binary package from remote location by specifying
a URL.
The URL can be put into an environment variable,
.Ev PKG_PATH .
.Bd -literal
# pkg_add -v ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/i386/3.1_2007Q2/All/firefox-2.0.0.4.tgz

# export PKG_PATH=ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/i386/3.1_2007Q2/All
# pkg_add -v firefox
.Ed
.Pp
Over time, as problems are found in packages, they will be moved
from the
.Pa All
subdirectory into the
.Pa vulnerable
subdirectory.
If you want to accept vulnerable packages by default
(and know what you are doing),
you can add the
.Pa vulnerable
directory to your
.Ev PKG_PATH
like this:
.Bd -literal
# export PKG_PATH="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/i386/3.1_2007Q2/All/;ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/i386/3.1_2007Q2/vulnerable/"
.Ed
.Pp
(The quotes are needed because semicolon
.Pq Sq \&;
is a shell meta-character.)
If you do this, consider using the audit capabilities in
.Xr pkg_admin 1
and running it after every
.Nm .
