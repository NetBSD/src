.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg_install.conf
.Nd configuration file for package installation tools
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Nm
contains system defaults for the package installation tools
as a list of variable-value pairs.
Each line has the format
.Ev VARIABLE=VALUE .
If the value consists of more than one line, each line is prefixed with
.Ev VARIABLE= .
.Pp
The current value of a variable can be checked by running
.Dl Ic pkg_admin config-var VARIABLE
.Pp
Some variables are overriden by environmental variables of the same name.
Those are marked by (*).
.Pp
The following variables are supported:
.Bl -tag -width 6n
.It Dv ACCEPTABLE_LICENSES No (list of license names)
Default: empty
.Pp
Space-separated list of licenses considered acceptable when
.Dv CHECK_LICENSE
is
.Ql yes
or
.Ql always ,
in addition to those listed in
.Dv DEFAULT_ACCEPTABLE_LICENSES .
License names are case-sensitive.
.It Dv ACTIVE_FTP No (empty or non-empty)
Default: empty
.Pp
If non-empty, force the use of active FTP.
Otherwise, try passive FTP first, and fall back to active FTP if the
server reports a syntax error.
.It Dv CACHE_INDEX No ( So Li yes Sc or So Li no Sc )
Default:
.Li yes
.Pp
If
.Ql yes ,
cache directory listings in memory.
This avoids retransfers of the large directory index for HTTP.
.It Dv CERTIFICATE_ANCHOR_PKGS No (empty or path)
Default: empty
.Pp
Path to the file containing the certificates used for validating binary
packages.
A package is trusted when a certificate chain ends in one of the
certificates contained in this file.
The certificates must be PEM-encoded.
.Pp
Required when
.Dv VERIFIED_INSTALLATION
is anything other than
.Ql never .
.It Dv CERTIFICATE_ANCHOR_PKGVULN No (empty or path)
Default: empty
.Pp
If non-empty, path to the file containing the certificates used for
validating
.Pa pkg-vulnerabilities .
The
.Pa pkg-vulnerabilities
is trusted when a certificate chain ends in one of the certificates
contained in this file.
The certificates must be PEM-encoded.
.It Dv CERTIFICATE_CHAIN No (empty or path)
Default: empty
.Pp
If non-empty, path to a file containing additional certificates that
can be used for completing certificate chains when validating binary
packages or pkg-vulnerabilities files.
.It Dv CHECK_LICENSE No ( So Li yes Sc , So Li no Sc , or So Li always Sc )
Default:
.Li no
.Pp
When installing a package, check whether its license, as specified in
the
.Dv LICENSE
build info tag, is acceptable,
i.e., listed in
.Dv ACCEPTABLE_LICENSES
or
.Dv DEFAULT_ACCEPTABLE_LICENSES .
.Pp
Supported values are:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv always"
.It Dv no
Install package no matter what license it has.
.It Dv yes
If package has
.Dv LICENSE
set, require the license to be acceptable before installing.
If package is missing
.Dv LICENSE ,
install it anyway.
.It Dv always
Require
.Dv LICENSE
to be set, and require the license to be acceptable, before
installing.
.El
.It Dv CHECK_END_OF_LIFE No ( So Li yes Sc or So Li no Sc )
Default:
.Ql yes
.Pp
During vulnerability checks, consider packages that have reached end-of-life
as vulnerable.
.It Dv CHECK_OS_VERSION No ( So Li yes Sc or So Li no Sc )
Default:
.Ql yes
.Pp
If
.Ql yes ,
pkg_add will warn if the host OS version mismatches the OS version the
package was built on.
.Pp
For example, you can set this to
.Ql no
in order to install packages built for
.Nx 9.0
on
.Nx 10.0 ,
where they will still generally work.
Packages for which this may not work have a more stringent version
check through the
.Li osabi
package; see
.Dv CHECK_OSABI .
.It Dv CHECK_OSABI No ( So Li yes Sc or So Li no Sc )
Default:
.Ql yes
.Pp
If
.Ql yes ,
the
.Li osabi
package checks that it matches the OS version.
.Pp
Packages that are tightly bound to a specific version of an operating
system, such as kernel modules or
.Dv sysutils/lsof ,
depend on the
.Li osabi
package to reflect this, so that even if
.Dv CHECK_OS_VERSION
is
.Ql no ,
such packages will refuse to install unless
.Dv CHECK_OSABI
is also
.Ql no .
.It Dv CHECK_VULNERABILITIES No ( So Li never Sc , So Li always Sc , or So Li interactive Sc )
Default:
.Ql never
.Pp
Check for vulnerabilities when installing a package.
Supported values are:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv interactive"
.It Dv never
Install package even if it is known to be vulnerable.
.It Dv always
Install package only if it is not known to be vulnerable.
.Pp
If the
.Pa pkg-vulnerabilities
file is missing, assume package is vulnerable and refuse to install
it.
.It Dv interactive
Install package without user interaction if it is not known to be
vulnerable.
Otherwise, prompt user to confirm installation.
.Pp
If the
.Pa pkg-vulnerabilities
file is missing, ignore it and install package anyway.
