Installation
===================================

**Prerequisites**

Python 2.4 or higher, SWIG 1.3 or higher, GNU make

**Download**

You can download the source codes `here`_.
The latest release is 1.1.1, Jan 15, 2009.

.. _here: unbound-1.1.1-py.tar.gz

**Compiling**

After downloading, you can compile the Unbound library by doing::

	> tar -xzf unbound-1.1.1-py.tar.gz
	> cd unbound-1.1.1
	> ./configure --with-pythonmodule
	> make

You need GNU make to compile sources.
SWIG and Python devel libraries to compile extension module. 

**Testing**

If the compilation is successful, you can test the extension module by::

	> cd pythonmod
	> make sudo # or "make test" or "make suexec"

This will start unbound server with language dictionary service (see :ref:`Tutorials`).
In order to test this service, type::
  
   > dig TXT @127.0.0.1 aught.en._dict_.cz

Dig should print this message (czech equivalent of aught)::

   ; <<>> DiG 9.5.0-P2 <<>> TXT @127.0.0.1 aught.en._dict_.cz
   ; (1 server found)
