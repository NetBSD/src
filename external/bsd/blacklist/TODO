- don't poll periodically, find the next timeout
- perhaps pass addresses through the socket too?
- use the socket also for commands? Or separate socket?
- test udp
- add functionality to the control program. Should it change the database
  directly, or talk to the daemon to have it do it?
- perhaps handle interfaces too instead of addresses for dynamic ip?
  <bge0/4>? What to do with multiple addresses?
- make a pidfile
- fix CRED on linux and macosx.
