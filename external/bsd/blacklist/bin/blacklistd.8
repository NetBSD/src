.Dt BLACKLISTD 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm blacklistd ,
.Nd block and release ports on demand to avoid DoS abuse
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dfrv
.Op Fl C Ar controlprog
.Op Fl c Ar configfile
.Op Fl D Ar dbfile
.Op Fl P Ar sockpathsfile
.Op Fl R Ar rulename
.Op Fl s Ar sockpath
.Op Fl t Ar timeout
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a daemon similar to
.Xr syslogd 8
that listens to a sockets at paths specified in the
.Ar sockpathsfile
for notifications from other daemons about successful or failed connection
attempts.
If no such file is specified, then it only listens to the socket path
specified by
.Ar sockspath
or if that is not specified to
.Pa /var/run/blsock .
Each notification contains an (action, port, protocol, address, owner) tuple
that identifies the remote connection and the action.
This tuple is consulted against entries in
.Ar configfile
with syntax specified in
.Xr blacklistd.conf 5 .
If an entry is matched, a state entry is created for that tuple.
Each entry contains a number of tries limit and a duration.
.Pp
If the action is
.Dq add
and the number of tries limit is reached, then a
control script
.Ar controlprog
is invoked with arguments:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
control add <rulename> <proto> <address> <mask> <port>
.Ed
.Pp
and should invoke a packet filter command to block the connection
specified by the arguments.
The
.Ar rulename
argument can be set from the command line (default
.Dv blacklistd ) .
The script could print a numerical id to stdout as a handle for
the rule that can be used later to remove that connection, but
that is not required as all information to remove the rule is
kept.
.Pp
If the action is
.Dq remove
Then the same control script is invoked as:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
control add <rulename> <proto> <address> <mask> <port>
.Ed
.Pp
where
.Ar id
is the number returned from the
.Dq add
action.
.Pp
.Nm
maintains a database of known connections in
.Ar dbfile .
On startup it reads entries from that file, and updates its internal state.
If the
.Fl f
flag is specified, then the database is truncated an all the rules named
.Ar rulename
are deleted by invoking the control script as:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
control flush <rulename>
.Ed
If the
.Fl r
flag is specified, the firewall rules are re-read from the internal database
and are removed and re-added.
This helps for packet filters that don't retain state across reboots.
.Pp
.Nm
checks the list of active entries every
.Ar timeout
seconds (default
.Dv 15 )
and removes entries and block rules using the control program as necessary.
.Pp
Normally,
.Nm
disassociates itself from the terminal and writes messages to
.Xr syslogd 8 ,
unless the
.Fl d
flag is specified, in which case it stays in the foreground.
The
.Fl v
cases
.Nm
to print
diagnostic messages to
.Dv stdout
instead of
.Xr syslogd 8 .
