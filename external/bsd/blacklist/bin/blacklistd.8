.Dt BLACKLISTD 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm blacklistd ,
.Nm blacklistd.conf
.Nd block and release ports on demand to avoid DoS abuse
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl df
.Op Fl c Ar configfile
.Op Fl C Ar controlprog
.Op Fl D Ar dbfile
.Op Fl r Ar rulename
.Op Fl s Ar sockpath
.Op Fl t Ar timeout
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a daemon similar to
.Xr syslogd 8
that listens to a socket at
.Ar sockpath
for notifications from other daemons about successful or failed connection
attempts.
Each notification contains a (action, port, protocol, address, owner) tuple
that identifies the remote connection and the action.
This tuple is consulted against entries in
.Ar configfile
with syntax specified in
.Xr blacklistd.conf 5 .
If an entry is matched, a state entry is created for that tuple.
Each entry contains a number of tries limit and a duration.
.Pp
If the action is
.Dq add
and the number of tries limit is reached, then a
control script
.Ar controlprog
is invoked with arguments:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
control add <rulename> <proto> <port> <address>
.Ed
.Pp
and should invoke a packet filter command to block the connection
specified by the arguments.
The
.Ar rulename
argument can be set from the command line (default 
.Dv blacklistd ).
The script should print a numerical id to stdout as a handle for
the rule that can be used later to remove that connection.
.Pp
If the action is
.Dq remove
Then the same control script is invoked as:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
control rem <rulename> <id>
.Ed
.Pp
where 
.Ar id
is the number returned from the
.Dq add
action.
.Pp
.Nm
maintains a database of known connections in
.Ar dbfile .
On startup it reads entries from that file, and updates its internal state.
If the
.Fl f
flag is specified, then the database is truncated an all the rules named
.Ar rulename
are deleted by invoking the control script as:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
control flush <rulename>
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm
checks the list of active entries every
.Ar timeout
seconds (default
.Dv 15 )
and removes entries and block rules using the control program as necessary.
.Pp
The configuration file contains one tuple per line, and is similar to
.Xr inetd.conf .
There must be an entry for each field of the configuration file, with
entries for each field separated by a tab or a space.
Comments are denoted by a
.Dq #
at the beginning of a line.
There must be an entry for each field; entries can be numeric or symbolic,
where appropriate (
.Dv service ,
.Dv user )
and can be
.Dq *
for all fields.
The fields of the configuration file are as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
[address:]service
socket-type
protocol
user
rulename
nfail
duration
.Ed
.Pp
Normally,
.Nm
disassociates itself from the terminal and writes messages to
.Xr syslogd 8 ,
unless the
.Fl d
flag is specified, in which case it stays in the foreground and prints
diagnostic messages to
.Dv stdout .
