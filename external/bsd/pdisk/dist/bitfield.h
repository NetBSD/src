// bitfield.h - extract and set bit fields
//
// Written by Eryk Vershen
//
// Bitfields are not particularly transportable between big and little
// endian machines.  Big endian machines lay out bitfields starting
// from the most significant bit of the (one, two or four byte) number,
// whereas little endian machines lay out bitfields starting from the
// least signifcant bit.
//
// These routines were written to support some bitfields in a disk
// data structure (partition map) whose original definition was on
// a big-endian machine.
//
// They only work on 32-bit values because I didn't need 16-bit support.
// The bits in the long word are numbered from 0 (least significant) to
// 31 (most significant).
