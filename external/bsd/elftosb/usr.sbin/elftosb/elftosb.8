.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
programm is used to create a digitaly signed sb boot file.
This sb file can be booted by the first stage boot loader found in
Freescale i.MX23 and i.MX28 application processors.
One or several ELF files and optionaly a key are taken as input and
processed under the control of a command file to generate the sb file.
