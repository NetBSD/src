.Sh NAME
.Nm ccom
.Nd C compiler
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl gkpsv
.Op Fl f Ar features
.Op Fl m Ar options
.Op Fl W Ar warnings
.Op Fl X Ar flags
.Op Fl x Ar settings
.Op Fl Z Ar flags
.Op infile

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides a C compiler.
The frontend is usually
.Xr pcc 1 .
It is
.Em not
intended to be run directly.
.Nm
reads the C source from
.Ar infile
or standard input and writes the assembler source
to
.Ar outfile
or to standard output.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f Ar feature
Enable language features.
Multiple
.Fl f
options can be given, the following features are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy stack-protector
Enable stack smashing protection.
Currently the same as
.Sy stack-protector-all .
.It Sy stack-protector-all
Enable stack smashing protection for all functions.
.It Sy pack-struct Ns Oo = Ns Ar n Oc
Specify maximum alignment for structure members, similar to a #pragma pack
statement at the start of the file.
If no value is given, the default is 1.
.It Sy freestanding
Emit code for a freestanding environment.
Currently not implemented.
.El
.It Fl g
Include debugging information in the output code for use by
symbolic and source-level debuggers.
Currently this uses the
.Sy stabs
format, encoding information in
.Em s Ns ymbol Em tab Ns le entrie Ns Em s.
.It Fl k
Generate PIC code.
.It Fl m Ar option
Target-specific options, used in machine-dependent code.
Multiple
.Fl m
options can be given, the following options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width PowerPC
.It AMD64
.It ARM
.Sy little-endian Ns ,
.Sy big-endian Ns ,
.Sy fpe=fpa Ns ,
.Sy fpe=vpf Ns ,

.Sy arch=armv6t2 Ns ,
.Sy arch=armv6kz Ns ,
.Sy arch=armv6k No \*(Am
.Sy arch=armv7 Ns .

.Sy little-endian Ns ,
.Sy big-endian Ns ,
.Sy soft-float No \*(Am
.Sy hard-float Ns .
.It Sparc64
.It VAX
.El
.It Fl p
Generate profiling code.
.It Fl s
Print statistics to standard error when complete.
This includes:
name table entries, name string size, permanent allocated memory,
temporary allocated memory, lost memory, argument list unions,
dimension/function unions, struct/union/enum blocks, inline node count,
inline control blocks, and permanent symtab entries.
.\" TODO: explain units for above?
.It Fl v
Display version.
.It Fl W Ar warning
Do some basic checks and emit warnings about possible coding problems.
Multiple
.Fl W
options can be given, the following warnings are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy error Ns Oo = Ns Ar warning Oc
Enable
.Ar warning ,
and treat it as an error condition.
If a specific warning is not given, producing any warning will cause an error.
.It Sy implicit-function-declaration
(TODO) Require explicit prototypes for all called functions.
.It Sy implicit-int
(TODO) Warn when a function declaration lacks a type.
.It Sy missing-prototypes
Require explicit prototypes for all global function definitions.
.It Sy pointer-sign
Warn when pointer operations are done with mismatched signed and unsigned values.
.It Sy sign-compare
(TODO) Warn about comparisons between signed and unsigned values.
.It Sy strict-prototypes
(TODO) Require that function prototypes are strictly C99.
.It Sy shadow
Report when a local variable shadows something from a higher scope.
.It Sy truncate
Report when integer values may be implicitly truncated to fit a smaller type.
.It Sy unknown-pragmas
Report unhandled pragma statements.
.It Sy unreachable-code
Report statements that cannot be executed.
.El
.Pp
Any of the above may be prefixed with
.Dq no-
in order to disable the effect.
.\"
.It Fl X Ar flags
C specific debugging where
.Ar flags
is one or more of the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width Ds
.It Sy b
Building of parse trees
.It Sy d
Declarations (using multiple
.Sy d
flags gives more output)
.It Sy e
Pass1 trees at exit
.It Sy i
Initializations
.It Sy n
Memory allocations
.It Sy o
Turn off optimisations
.It Sy p
Prototypes
.It Sy s
Inlining

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
compiler is based on the original Portable C Compiler by
.An "S. C. Johnson" ,
written in the late 70's.
Even though much of the compiler has been rewritten
.Pq about 50% of the frontend code and 80% of the backend ,
some of the basics still remain.
Most is written by
.An "Anders Magnusson" ,
with the exception of the data-flow analysis part and
the SSA conversion code which is written by
.An "Peter A Jonsson" ,
and the Mips port that were written as part of a project
by undergraduate students at Lulea University of Technology.
