OS-dependent and target-dependent:

crt0.o		startup code for programs (maybe compiled -static)
crt1.o		startup code for programs compiled -dynamic (if necessary)
gcrt1.o		profiling startup code for programs (maybe compiled -dynamic)
crti.o		beginning of _init() and _fini() functions (inside .init section)
crtn.o		end of _init() and _fini() functions (inside .fini section)

OS-dependent, but target-independent:

crtbegin.o	support for calling global ctors/dtors
crtend.o	end of the ctor/dtor lists
crtbeginT.o	+ for static binary (if necessary)
crtendT.o	+ for static binary (if necessary)
crtbeginS.o	+ for shared library (if necessary)
crtendS.o	+ for shared library (if necessary)
