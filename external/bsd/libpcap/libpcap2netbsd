# libpcap2netbsd:  convert an libpcap source tree into a
# netbsd libpcap source tree, under src/dist,
#
# Rough instructions for importing new libpcap release:
#
#	$ cd /some/where/temporary
#	$ tar xpfz /new/libpcap/release/tar/file
#	$ sh /usr/src/external/bsd/libpcap/libpcap2netbsd libpcap-x.y.z
#	$ cd libpcap-YYYYMMDD
#	$ cvs -d cvs.netbsd.org:/cvsroot import -m "Import libpcap-x.y.z" src/external/bsd/libpcap/dist TCPDUMP libpcap-x_y_z
#	- check makefiles to see if any extra sources have been added.
#	- update distrib/sets if necessary.
