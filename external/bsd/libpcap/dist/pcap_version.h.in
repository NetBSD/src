 * bound into the program binary, so if the string in the version of the
 * library with which the program was linked isn't the same as the
 * string in the version of the library with which the program is being
 * run, various undesirable things may happen (warnings, the string
 * being the one from the version of the library with which the program
 * was linked, or even weirder things, such as the string being the one
 * from the library but being truncated).
