This directory contains a slapd overlay, "allowed".

    --- o --- o --- o ---

It adds to entries returned by search operations the value of attributes

"allowedAttributes"
	<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms675217(VS.85).aspx>

"allowedAttributesEffective"
	<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms675218(VS.85).aspx>

No other use is made of those attributes: they cannot be compared,
they cannot be used in search filters, they cannot be used in ACLs, ...

    --- o --- o --- o ---

Other attributes like

"allowedChildClasses"
	<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms675219(VS.85).aspx>
"allowedChildClassesEffective"
	<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms675220(VS.85).aspx>

make little sense within OpenLDAP's slapd right now, since any AUXILIARY
objectClass can be added to an entry, while no STRUCTURAL objectClass can.
This may change when DIT structure rules are implemented, while ACLs may
restrict what AUXILIARY objectClasses can be added to an entry.

    --- o --- o --- o ---

Usage: add to slapd.conf(5)


moduleload	path/to/allowed.so
overlay		allowed

or add

dn: olcOverlay={0}allowed,olcDatabase={1}bdb,cn=config
objectClass: olcOverlayConfig
olcOverlay: {0}allowed

as a child of the database that's intended to support this feature
(replace "olcDatabase={1}bdb,cn=config" with the appropriate parent);
or use

dn: olcOverlay={0}allowed,olcDatabase={-1}frontend,cn=config
objectClass: olcOverlayConfig
olcOverlay: {0}allowed

if it's supposed to be global.

No Makefile is provided. Use a command line similar to:

gcc -shared -I../../../include -I../../../servers/slapd -Wall -g \
	-o allowed.so allowed.c

to compile this overlay, or even better use OpenLDAP's libtool as appropriate.
