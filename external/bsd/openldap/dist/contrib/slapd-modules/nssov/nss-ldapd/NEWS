  started in nslcd
* handle empty netgroups properly
* change the time out and retry mechanism for connecting to the LDAP server to
  return an error quickly if the LDAP server is known to be unavailable for a

* increased the time out values between the NSS module and nslcd because of
  new retry mechanism
* implement new dict and set modules that use a hashtable to map keys
  efficiently
* use the new set to store group membership to simplify memory management and
  eliminate duplicate members

  the uniqueMember attribute to save on doing LDAP searches for groups with a
  lot of members, based on a patch by Petter Reinholdtsen

  Ralf Haferkamp and Michael Calmer from SuSE
* added support for DOMAIN as base DN which uses the host's domain to
  construct a DN

* major cleanups and simplifications in the core LDAP query code (we don't
  need to worry about SIGPIPE because nslcd does that globally, locking
  because a connection is only used by one thread) and more simplifications in
  the the LDAP connection and query state
* get base, scope, filter and map configfile directives properly working
* simplifications in LDAP reconnect logic (some work remains to be done in
  this area)

* configuration syntax is now documented in the nss-ldapd.conf(5) manual page
* support for dnsconfig was removed
* the configuration file no longer supports using multiple search bases
* removed nss_initgroups and nss_initgroups_ignoreusers options

* general code reorganisation and clean-ups to achieve another 9% code
  reduction relative to 0.2.1 release (more than 40% relative to nss_ldap)
* SASL, Kerberos and SSL/TLS support remain untested

* implemented a timeout mechanism in the communication between the NSS part
  and the nslcd server part


changes from nss_ldap 251 to nss-ldapd 0.1
------------------------------------------

* initial release of nss-ldapd (should be functional but not yet stable enough
  for production use)
* fork from the nss_ldap which was originally written by Luke Howard of PADL
  Software Pty Ltd. changing package name to nss-ldapd and versioning scheme
* the functionality was split into a thin NSS library and a simple daemon
  proxying the requests to the LDAP server (see README for rationale)
* a lot of dead and old compatibility code was removed (about 25% of the code
  was removed) (more simplifications to come)
* the test code was rewritten
* build script simplifications
* default configuration file has been changed to /etc/nss-ldapd.conf
* most documentation has been updated and rewritten
* dropped support for non-glibc NSS interfaces and assumed OpenLDAP compatible
  library


changes from 250 to 251
-----------------------

* remove doc/rfc2307.txt, it is available from
  http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2307.txt

  unloaded and memory is still referenced
* fix for BUG#249: tcsh closes file descriptors, confuses nss_ldap and hangs
  (from David Houlder)

  nss_ldap-246


changes from 246 to 247
-----------------------

* double-check *ld != NULL even if mapped eror return from ldap_initialize()
  returns NSS_SUCCESS


changes from 245 to 246
-----------------------

* paged results and RFC2307bis support are now always compiled in; they are by
  default disabled unless you configured with --enable-paged-results and
  --enable-rfc2307bis, respectively. See nss_ldap(5) for configuration
  options.
* fix for BUG#219: paged results delivers wrong results
* fix for BUG#222: use asynchronous start TLS if available, using bind_timeout
  value
* fix for BUG#235: make DNS SRV lookup domain configurable (nss_srv_domain)

  avoid persistent connection
* add nss_connect_policy argument to ldap.conf


changes from 244 to 245
-----------------------

* don't leak LDAP connection if do_bind() failed or descriptor owner had
  changed. If do_bind() failed the underlying descriptor would also be leaked,
  causing a large number of sockets to be consumed during failover
* add nss_initgroups_ignoreusers parameter to ldap.conf, returns NOTFOUND if
  nss_ldap's initgroups() is called for users (comma separated)

  nss_reconnect_maxsleeptime, nss_reconnect_maxconntries directives
* reload configuration file if changed


changes from 239 to 240
-----------------------

* new API for resolving automounts (requires custom autofs plugin for Linux at
  present): _nss_ldap_setautomntent(), _nss_ldap_getautomntent(),
  _nss_ldap_endautomntent(), _nss_ldap_getautomntbyname_r()

* fix for BUG#205: accept line feeds in ldap.conf
* fix for BUG#211: nss_ldap fails to start TLS on referred connections
* fix for BUG#213: initgroups crash if RFC2307bis undefined
* turn down reconnection logging volume


changes from 238 to 239
-----------------------

* support for initgroups using backlinks (selectable at runtime if RFC2307bis
  support is enabled, using the nss_initgroups backlink configuration
  directive)
* support for dynamically expanding filter sizes
* from Peter Marschall <peter@adpm.de>: revert the deletion of blanks/tabs in
  ldap.conf that happened between 235 and 238
* from Peter Marschall <peter@adpm.de>: This patch changes configure.in and
  Makefile.am so that ldap.conf gets installed in the place and with the name
  that is given to the configure option --with-ldap-conf-file. In addition to
  that it fixes a long standing bug in Makefile.am that tries to install a
  file before the destination directory is guaranteed to be created (hunk #3),
  and uses $(mkinstalldirs) for AIX (hunk #2).


changes from 237 to 238
-----------------------

* more manual page updates


changes from 236 to 237
-----------------------

* more manual page updates


changes from 235 to 236
-----------------------

* fix for BUG#201: typo in ldap-schema.c causing build to fail
* add manual page for nss_ldap


changes from 234 to 235
-----------------------

* fix for BUG#198: make pagesize configurable
* fix for BUG#199: correct fix for BUG#138 (blind last char remove in
  ldap.secret)


changes from 233 to 234
-----------------------

* don't reacquire global lock in do_next_page()
* restore old "bind_policy hard" behaviour (don't try to reconnect if
  initialization failed). The behaviour introduced in nss_ldap-227 can be
  enabled with "bind_policy hard_init".


changes from 232 to 233
-----------------------

* if do_open() returns NSS_UNAVAIL, don't try to do server reconnect; only do
  it if NSS_TRYAGAIN is returned This should fix the problems introduced by
  the fixes in nss_ldap-227 (delayed binding)


changes from 231 to 232
-----------------------

* fix for BUG#138 (blind last char remove in ldap.secret)


changes from 229 to 230
-----------------------

* don't free gss_krb5_ccache_name() output (Heimdal)


changes from 228 to 229
-----------------------

* more debugging in initgroups and _nss_ldap_getentry()
* fix _nss_ldap_getentry() enumeration behaviour, and optimize by not
  searching if the requested attribute cannot be mapped


changes from 227 to 228
-----------------------

* fix for BUG#188: better documentation for OpenLDAP SSL options
* fix for BUG#189: do not configure tls_checkpeer unless it is explicitly
  specifier in ldap.conf
* fix for BUG#190: set ls_state to LS_UNINITIALIZED after fork


changes from 226 to 227
-----------------------

* separate initializing LDAP session with actually connecting to the DSA, so
  that we don't try to bind until we actually need to search (which allows the
  retry logic in the search function to also apply to binding). NB: this will
  only provide improved behavior for LDAP client libraries that support
  ldap_init() or ldap_initialize() rather than ldap_open
* fix for BUG#183: support pw_change and pw_expire on BSD
* fix for BUG#187: NSS_BUFLEN_DEFAULT causing problems on IRS platforms
* fix for glibc 2.1 from Alexander Spannagel

changes from 224 to 225
-----------------------

* make LDAP_NSS_NGROUPS 64 - better choice for small directories


changes from 223 to 224
-----------------------

* don't double-free on realloc() failure in do_parse_group_members()
* don't pass LDAP session as an argument, as it may refer to a stale LDAP
  handle. If this does not work we will need to replace LDAPMessage pointers
  with pointers to a structure that contains a reference-counted LDAP handle
  as well as the message
* fix crasher when internal group membership buffer was reallocated
  (introduced with nested group expansion code)
* immediately return NSS_TRYAGAIN and errno=ERANGE if there is not enough
  buffer space to handle LDAP_NSS_NGROUPS groups; this prevents getgrXXX()
  from expensive repeated directory searches when there is a priori knowledge
  that group memberships are large


changes from 222 to 223
-----------------------

* allow empty lines in /etc/ldap.conf
* do loop detection in nested groups

* implement _nss_ldap_getentry for AIX enumeration
* implement netgroups for IRS/AIX
* remove dependency on Berkeley DB - schema mapping and RFC2307bis no longer
  requires DB
* remove old NeXT cruft in resolve.c


changes from 218 to 220
-----------------------

* fix for BUG#169: getntohost() on Solaris
* fix for BUG#170: _nss_ldap_getgroupsbymember_r fails to return all groups
  when NSCD is running and attribute mapping is enabled on Solaris
* fix for BUG#173: reinstate use of sigaction() (XXX what is the correct fix
  here?)
* fix for BUG#174: innetgr() depth checking


changes from 217 to 218
-----------------------

* fix for BUG#168: set errnop to ENOENT if not found

-----------------------

* fix for BUG#167: compilation fails on Solaris


changes from 215 to 216
-----------------------

* patch from Thorsten Kukuk to avoid overwriting sockaddr storage for IPv6;
  use struct sockaddr_storage if available
* fix for BUG#153: use asynchronous search API in initgroups()
* fix for BUG#157: check for __pthread_once rather than __pthread_atfork on
  glibc, as the latter is no longer exported
* fix for BUG#158: escape netgroup search filters correctly
* fix for BUG#161: remove redundant lock in _nss_ldap_innetgr()
* fix for BUG#164: set schema element array size to LM_NONE + 1 not LM_NONE
* fix for BUG#165: make _nss_ldap_result() private
* fix for BUG#166: chase all nested netgroups in innetgr()
* fix deadlock if getXXXent() called without first calling setXXXent()
* only request gidNumber attribute when initgroups() (avoids sending back rest
  of a group's entry)
* don't request any attributes when mapping a user to a DN (we want the DN
  only)


changes from 214 to 215
-----------------------

* choose between using native GSS-API and putenv() for setting ccache path
* per-map attribute mapping for attributes that appear in multiple maps


changes from 213 to 214

* define LDAP_DEPRECATED for compiling against OpenLDAP 2.2


changes from 212 to 213
-----------------------

* fix netgroup compilation error when debugging is enabled
* support GSS-API for setting ccache name
* initgroups() should require user to be a POSIX account
* define LOGNAME_MAX for HP-UX
* do not use sigprocmask() - this blocks rather than disabling signals
* SASL version check fix from Howard Chu


changes from 211 to 212
-----------------------

* Solaris netgroup support test release
* fix crasher in do_sasl_interact()
* do_sasl_interact() needs to strdup() result for Cyrus SASL 1.x but not 2.x

* add the "sasl_secprops" option to configure SASL security layers (usage as
  for OpenLDAP ldap.conf)
* add the "krb5_ccname" option to specify the location of the Kerberos ticket
  cache (requires --enable-configurable-krb5-ccname for now as it is a fairly
  coarse solution to a lack of appropriate API in the Kerberos libraries)
* add support for native Active Directory password policy attributes (enabled
  if shadowLastChange is mapped to pwdLastSet)
* add "nss_override_attribute_value" and "nss_default_attribute_value"
  keywords for over- riding and setting default attribute values, respectively

  records, and doesn't handle long responses (Nalin at RedHat)


changes from 197 to 198
-----------------------

* BUG#108: fix potential buffer overflow in dnsconfig.c (could be triggered if
  no flat file configuration for nss_ldap and large DNS SRV data for domain;
  because nss_ldap in SRV mode trusts DNS we do not believe this to be
  exploitable to elevate privilege in the default configuration)
* do not malloc() configuration structure; use buffer

-----------------------

* improved AIX documentation from Dejan Muhamedagic

  some cases close a descriptor it did not own. Patch was provided by Luca
  Filipozzi.


changes from 184 to 185
-----------------------

* updated copyrights
* fix for BUG#82: set close on exec (Debian bug 136953)


changes from 183 to 184

  underlying socket to LDAP server
* include local copy of irs.h under AIX
* general cleanup of locking code
* _nss_ldap_no_members appears to only need defining for when RFC2307bis is

changes from 178 to 179
-----------------------

changes from 177 to 178
-----------------------

* patch from Gabor Gombas for AIX support
* Makefile.am: sasl.o needed by NSS_LDAP
* aix_authmeth.c: method_passwordexpired is really method_passwdexpired; but
  since the struct was bzero()ed no need to set it to NULL
* configure.in: support both gcc and xlc_r

changes from 171 to 172
-----------------------

* fixed schema mapping bug by storing a copy of the mapped schema in the
  Berkeley DB rather than the element itself. Because the DB library returns
  static storage, this was causing problems where the schema mapping calls
  were used to build the attribute table in ldap-schema.c. This bugfix was
  sponsored by n2h2.com; thanks!


changes from 170 to 171
-----------------------

* added ldap.conf stanza for AIX
* workaround for schema mapping bug.


changes from 169 to 170
-----------------------

* use _nss_ldap_getrdnvalue() for determining canonical group name


changes from 168 to 169

* fixed typo in ldap-service.c; prefix filters now with _nss_ldap


changes from 167 to 168
-----------------------

* initialize old_handler to SIG_DFL
* incorporate Stephan Cremer's mapping patches, a big thanks to Stephan for
  these!

changes from 166 to 167
-----------------------

-----------------------

* hopefully fixed use of synchronous searches in _nss_ldap_getbyname()


changes from 159 to 160
-----------------------

* patch from RedHat to check for DB3, override install user/group optionally
* use synchronous searches for _nss_ldap_getbyname()
* only set SSL options if we have values for those options


changes from 158 to 159
-----------------------

* make do_ssl_options() take a config parameter; avoid segfault with SSL?


changes from 157 to 158
-----------------------

* in the distinguished name to login cache (dn2uid) make sure we use the
  AT(uid) macro for the uid attribute rather than the hard-coded value of
  "uid" This should enable the cache for MSSFU support.


changes from 156 to 157
-----------------------

* for MSSFU, use posixMember for group memberships rather than member
  (reported by Andy Rechenberg)
* ignore SIGPIPE before calling do_close() for idle_timeout


changes from 155 to 156
-----------------------

* logic was around the wrong way in do_search(), all searches were broken!
* --disable-ssl option for configure
* removed "Obsoletes: pam_ldap" from spec file


changes from 154 to 155
-----------------------

* do not use private API when setting OpenLDAP TLS options (do_ssl_options())


changes from 153 to 154
-----------------------

* notes from Scott M. Stone <sstone@foo3.com>
* idle timeout patch from Steve Barrus


changes from 152 to 153

changes from 147 to 148
-----------------------

* check for HAVE_LDAP_SET_OPTION always


changes from 146 to 147
-----------------------

* check for ldap_set_option(), as LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS is defined for OpenLDAP
  1.x but without the ldap_set_option() function


changes from 145 to 146
-----------------------

* mass re-indentation, GNU style
* patch from Simon Wilkinson <sxw@sxw.org.uk> for compatibility with old

* when specifying filters with nss_base_XXX, only escape the filter argument
  not the entire filter


changes from 142 to 143
-----------------------

* patch from nalin@redhat.com to avoid corrupting the heap when the
  configuration file exists but has no host and base values.
  _nss_ldap_readconfigfromdns() will write to the region which was already
  freed.


changes from 141 to 142
-----------------------

* patch from Simon Wilkinson <sxw@sxw.org.uk> for memory leak in
  ldap-service.c


changes from 140 to 141

* use -rpath on all platforms except Solaris,
  not just Linux


changes from 139 to 140
-----------------------

  per-map search descriptors were specified in ldap.conf


changes from 138 to 139
-----------------------

* updated INSTALL file with boilerplate
* fixed pointer error in ldap-nss.c


changes from 137.1 to 138
-------------------------

* close config file FILE * if out of buffer space for parsing search
  descriptor
* fixed bug where non-recognized directives in ldap.conf would cause the
  configuration file to not be parsed at all, if they were the last entries in
  the config file.


changes from 137 to 137.1
-------------------------

* patch from nalin@redhat.com; return { NULL } not NULL for no group members
* cleaned up usage of libc-lock.h weak aliases to pthreads API; use in ltf.c
  also
* use __libc_atfork() or pthread_atfork() to close off connection on fork,
  rather than checking PIDs; this is expensive and breaks on Linux where each
  thread may have a different PID.


changes from 136 to 137
-----------------------

* build nss_ldap as a loadable module on AIX
* doco on AIX


changes from 135 to 136

-----------------------

* fixed logic bug in util.c introduced in nss_ldap-127


changes from 126 to 127
-----------------------

* updating copyright notices
* autoconf support; IRIX and OSF/1 support has been dropped (dl-*.[ch]) as no

* use OpenLDAP 2.x rebind proc with correct arguments
* added "timelimit" and "bind_timelimit" directives to ldap.conf

-------------------------

* if user is a shadowAccount, then don't return password in getpwent(),

changes from 101 to 102
-----------------------

* removed LDAP_MORE_RESULTS_TO_RETURN test


changes from 100 to 101
-----------------------

* fixed spec file


changes from 99 to 100
----------------------

* do_close_no_unbind() cleanup


changes from 97 to 98
---------------------

* deleted crypt-mechanism code. Junk.
* fixed call to _nss_ldap_read() after changing prototypes in nss_ldap-88


changes from 96 to 97
---------------------

* #ifndef HAVE_LDAP_LD_FREE, still call ldap_unbind(), but having closed the
  descriptor.


changes from 95 to 96
---------------------

* re-orged


changes from 94 to 95
---------------------

* disable SO_KEEPALIVE on socket rather than blocking SIGPIPE. Need to figure
  out the right way to do this.


changes from 93 to 94
---------------------

* committed some changes for the parent/child close problem. It relies on
  internal libldap APIs so it may be non-portable but should work with
  OpenLDAP and Netscape client libraries, and perhaps most UMich- derived
  client libraries. There's a possible workaround for client libraries without
  this; undefine HAVE_LDAP_LD_FREE to test this.


changes from 92 to 93
---------------------

* important fix: make sure return status is reset after do_open() ==
  NSS_SUCCESS, just in case no entries are returned. This bug was introduced
  in nss_ldap-88 and could potentially cause a security hole.


changes from 91 to 92
---------------------

---------------------

* added breaks to switch in _nss_ldap_lookup (thanks to Nathan.Hawkins@FMR.COM
  for pointing this out)
* save signal handler and ignore SIGPIPE for appropriate sections of do_open()
  and confirm connection is still active (patch from rpatel@globix.com)
* allow root users to bind as a different user, to provide quasi-shadow
  password support (patch from nazard@dragoninc.on.ca)
* under Linux, make Makefile look at last libc version (patch from
  nazard@dragoninc.on.ca)
* never clobber nsswitch.ldap/ldap.conf when making install (patch from
  nazard@dragoninc.on.ca)
* change do_open() to not unbind the parent ldap connection when the pid
  changes but simply open a new connection (patch from nazard@dragoninc.on.ca)
* changed _nss_ldap_lookup() and _nss_ldap_read() prototypes to return
  NSS_STATUS error codes, so that NSS_UNAVAIL percolates as appropriate.


changes from 86 to 87
---------------------

* fixed looking up DN-membered groups by member. Thanks to Jeff Mandel for
  spotting this hard to find bug.


changes from 85 to 86
---------------------

* member for NDS vs uniqueMember (needs further investigation; -DNDS)


changes from 84 to 85
---------------------

changes from 2.72 to 2.75
-------------------------

* incorporated RPM patches from stein@terminator.net


changes from 2.71 to 2.72
-------------------------

* implemented getgroupsbymember() for Solaris. Supplementary groups should be
  initialized now. (NB: doesn't appear to be quite working for RFC2307bis
  yet.)
* GNU indent-ified


changes from 2.70 to 2.71
-------------------------

* removed -DDEBUG as default build flag


changes from 2.69 to 2.70

-------------------------

* added warning about compiling with DS 4.1 LDAP SDK


changes from 2.59 to 2.60

-------------------------

* fixed potential crasher in dnsconfig.c
* LDAP session is now persistent for performance reasons. Removed references

  session reopened after a fork().


changes from 2.38 to 2.39
-------------------------

* fixed warning in ldap-ethers.c (removed const from struct ether)
* added ldap_version keyword to ldap.conf for parity with pam_ldap


changes from 2.37 to 2.38
-------------------------

* debugged ldap_explode_rdn() code

changes from 2.29c to 2.29d
---------------------------

* ldap-ethers.c: fixed to use HOSTNAME attribute


changes from 2.29b to 2.29c
---------------------------

* ieee8022Device -> ieee802Device


changes from 2.29a to 2.29b
---------------------------

* added ieee8022Device and bootableDevice classes,
  at Sun's request.


changes from 2.29 to 2.29a
--------------------------

* dc -> cn


changes from 2.28 to 2.29
-------------------------

* changed host/network/ethers naming schema see the -02 draft revision for
  more info


changes from 2.27 to 2.28
-------------------------

* ldap-pwd.c, ldap-spwd.c: fixed tmpbuf stuff. Yuck.


changes from 2.26 to 2.27
-------------------------

* ANNOUNCE: reflected draft-howard-nis-schema-01.txt
* ldap-spwd.c: default for shadow integer values is -1, not 0 and fixed
  crasher (thanks to dj@gregor.com)


changes from 2.25 to 2.26
-------------------------

* globals.c: added offset stuff back for mapping errnumbers. Weird: this stuff
  *was* in an earlier version of the work area. I have no idea where it went.
  Scary.


changes from 2.24 to 2.25
-------------------------

* irs-nss.h: added prototype for irs_ldap_acc()
* ldap-*.[ch]: removed redundent PARSER macro
* unbroke for GNU NSS (context_key_t changed to context_handle_t)


changes from 2.23 to 2.24
-------------------------

* irs-nss.c: added dispatch table for IRS library
* testpw5.c: added additional test program
* ldap-nss.c: removed spurious debug statement
* ldap-nss.c, util.c, dnsconfig.c: cleaned up memory allocation for config.
  (This could be improved, but there is no longer a static ldap_config_t
  structure.)
* Makefile: general cleanup


changes from 2.22 to 2.23
-------------------------

* default destructor is now simply wrapped around by individual backend
  destructors
* __EXTENSIONS__ defined for Solaris 2.6 to import strncasecmp()
* getbyname: fixed crasher in ldap-nss.c due to uninitialized variable
* ldap-parse.h, assorted others: tidied up resolver calls to use NSS_ARGS()
  macro and not to interfere with the previous backend's status (bad thing!)
* ldap-service.c: cleaned up potential uninitialized var in parser
* ldap-nss.c: no valued arrays are now { NULL } instead of NULL.


changes from 2.21 to 2.22
-------------------------

* testpw.c: XXX problem. dies with segfault, but gdb doesn't give me enough
  information; it's definitely within nss_ldap.so though. I just can't see the
  symbols. (Maybe dbx would be better...) However, testpw doesn't work at
  *all* under 2.5.1, and technically it shouldn't as it's not linked against
  liblthread. I haven't been able to duplicate this with testpw2, which is the
  same code linked with the thread library.
* backported to NeXT


changes from 2.20 to 2.21
-------------------------

* resolve.h: renamed functions so as to keep namespace clean
* snprintf.h: tidied up for systems which already have snprintf() and renamed
  anyway to keep namespace clean (_nss_ldap_snprintf)
* ldap-*.h: made character constants const to avoid nasty warnings
* globals.[ch]: as above
* README, TODO, ANNOUNCE: general documentation updates
* ldap-nss.c, et al: general work on Solaris 2.6 port, to get nscd working.
  Lots of fiddling with the locking.
* Major architectural changes to Solaris NSS implementation. Thread specific
  data is now stored in the backend, where it should be: just like it is in
  IRS. Locking is a little more coarse now, but it will do for the moment.
* Paul Henson's DCE module gave me the inspiration to do the backend stuff the
  "right" way -- thanks, Paul!
* As a result, a lot of the bugs listed in TODO have mysteriously fixed
  themselves. :-)


changes from 2.19 to 2.20
-------------------------

* Makefile.*: ensured resolve.[ch] and dnsconfig.[ch] were there.
* Makefile: should link now with gcc -shared instead of requiring cc.


changes from 2.18 to 2.19
-------------------------

* testpw4.c: added irs hostbyname() test
* Makefile: added correct flags to build position indepdenent code with Sun's
  compiler (thanks, Bill). Added SRV sources.
* testpw.c: works under NeXT, cleaned up a bit.
* ldap.conf: documented what this file does
* util.c: ignore blank lines in ldap.conf properly
* resolve.h: fixed up for Solaris


changes from 2.17 to 2.18
-------------------------

* ldap-network.c: fixed infinite loop in getnetbyname()
* util.c: goto out causes a compiler warning under Solaris. Documented this.
  Should fix this, I suppose, but we need to break out of two blocks. (We
  could remove the code that handles multivalued DNs, as it's fairly unlikely
  that someone will use a DN of o=Xedoc+dc=xedoc,c=US+dc=com, but who knows?)
* ldap-ethers.c: line 215, result was not assigned to an lvalue (should have
  been args->status, not args). Fixed.


changes from 2.16 to 2.17
-------------------------

* Cleaned up documentation and testpw4.c
* dnsconfig.c: Fixed strtok() bug which was clobbering domain


changes from 2.15 to 2.16
-------------------------

* util.c (_nss_ldap_readconfig) fixed strtok() typo


changes from 2.2 to 2.15
------------------------

* dnsconfig.c: got DNS SRV support working under NEXTSTEP
* util.c: (_nss_ldap_getdomainname) made host and network DN parsing compliant
  with current draft


changes from 2.1 to 2.2
-----------------------

* I'll get around to merging in the RCS log here one day. Nothing very
  exciting happened, I just backported the code to NEXTSTEP and compiled it.
