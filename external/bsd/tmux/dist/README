Welcome to tmux!

tmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be created,
accessed, and controlled from a single screen. tmux may be detached from a
screen and continue running in the background, then later reattached.

This release runs on OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Linux, OS X and Solaris.

tmux depends on libevent 2.x. Download it from:

	http://libevent.org

It also depends on ncurses, available from:

	http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/

To build and install tmux from a release tarball, use:

	$ ./configure && make
	$ sudo make install

tmux can use the utempter library to update utmp(5), if it is installed - run
configure with --enable-utempter to enable this.

To get and build the latest from version control:

	$ git clone https://github.com/tmux/tmux.git
	$ cd tmux
	$ sh autogen.sh
	$ ./configure && make

(Note that this requires at least a working C compiler, make, autoconf,
automake, pkg-config as well as libevent and ncurses libraries and headers.)

For more information see http://git-scm.com. Patches should be sent by email to
the mailing list at tmux-users@googlegroups.com or submitted through GitHub at
https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues.

For documentation on using tmux, see the tmux.1 manpage. It can be viewed from
the source tree with:

	$ nroff -mdoc tmux.1|less

A small example configuration in example_tmux.conf.

And a bash(1) completion file at:

	https://github.com/imomaliev/tmux-bash-completion

For debugging, running tmux with -v or -vv will generate server and client log
files in the current directory.
