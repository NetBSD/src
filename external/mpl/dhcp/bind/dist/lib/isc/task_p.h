 *\li	If 'default_quantum' is non-zero, then it will be used as the default

 * Notes:

 *\li	Calling isc_taskmgr_destroy() will shutdown all tasks managed by

 *
 *\li	isc_taskmgr_destroy() must not be called by a task event action,
 *	because it would block forever waiting for the event action to
 *	complete.  An event action that wants to cause task manager shutdown
 *	should request some non-event action thread of execution to do the
 *	shutdown, e.g. by signaling a condition variable or using
 *	isc_app_shutdown().
 *
 *\li	Task manager references are not reference counted, so the caller
 *	must ensure that no attempt will be made to use the manager after
 *	isc_taskmgr_destroy() returns.
 *
 * Requires:
 *
 *\li	'*managerp' is a valid task manager.
