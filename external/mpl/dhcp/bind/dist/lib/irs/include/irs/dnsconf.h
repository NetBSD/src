/*! \file
 *
 * \brief
 * The IRS dnsconf module parses an "advanced" configuration file related to
 * the DNS library, such as trust anchors for DNSSEC validation, and creates
 * the corresponding configuration objects for the DNS library modules.
 *
 * Notes:
 * This module is very experimental and the configuration syntax or library
 * interfaces may change in future versions.  Currently, only static
 * key configuration is supported; "trusted-keys" and "trust-anchors"/
 * "managed-keys" statements will be parsed exactly as they are in
 * named.conf, except that "trust-anchors" and "managed-keys" entries will
 * be treated as if they were configured with "static-key", even if they
 * were actually configured with "initial-key".
