/* The following macro handles the case of unwanted return values.  In

 * if the return value of the function is ignored and one can't dispose of
 * the warning by the use of void.  In conjunction with the use of -Werror
 * these warnings prohibit the compilation of the package.  This macro
 * allows us to assign the return value to a variable and then ignore it.
 *
 * __attribute__((unused)) is added for avoiding another warning about set,
 * but unused variable. This is produced by unused-but-set-variable switch
 * that is enabled by default in gcc 4.6.
