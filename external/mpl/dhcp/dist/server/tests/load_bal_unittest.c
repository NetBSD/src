/*
 * Test the load balancing code.  
 *
 * The two main variables are:
 * packet => the "packet" being processed
 * state  => the "state" of the failover peer
 * We only fill in the fields necessary for our testing
 * packet->raw->secs   => amount of time the client has been trying
 * packet->raw->hlen   => the length of the mac address of the client
 * packet->raw->chaddr => the mac address of the client
 * To simplify the tests the mac address will be only 1 byte long and
 * not really matter.  Instead the hba will be all 1s and the tests
 * will use the primary/secondary flag to change the expected result.
 *
 * state->i_am => primary or secondary
 * state->load_balance_max_secs => maxixum time for a client to be trying
 *                                 before the other peer responds
 *                                 set to 5 for these tests
 * state->hba = array of hash buckets assigning the hash to primary or secondary
 *              set to all ones (all primary) for theses tests
