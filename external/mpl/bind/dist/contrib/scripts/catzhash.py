# catzhash.py: generate the SHA-1 hash of a domain name in wire format.
#
# This can be used to determine the label to use in a catalog zone to
# represent the specified zone. For example, the zone
# "domain.example" can be represented in a catalog zone called
# "catalog.example" by adding the following record:
#
# 5960775ba382e7a4e09263fc06e7c00569b6a05c.zones.catalog.example. \
#    IN PTR domain.example.
#
# The label "5960775ba382e7a4e09263fc06e7c00569b6a05c" is the output of
# this script when run with the argument "domain.example".
