This directory is for tools and scripts related to the OpenDNSSEC KASP
("key and signature policy") format. Currently it only contains
"kasp2policy.py", a python script for converting KASP key policy
to the "dnssec.policy" format that is used by dnssec-keymgr.

This depends on PLY (python lex/yacc) and on the "isc.dnskey" module in
bin/python/isc.

Basic test:
$ python kasp2policy.py kasp.xml > policy.out
$ diff policy.out policy.good
