This directory contains contributed scripts, tools, libraries, and other
useful accessories to BIND 9.  Contrib software is not supported by ISC,
but reported bugs will be fixed as time permits.

    - scripts/

      Assorted useful scripts, including 'nanny' which monitors 
      named and restarts it in the event of a crash, 'zone-edit'
      which enables editing of a dynamic zone, and others

    - queryperf/

      A DNS query performance testing tool

    - perftcpdns/

      A performance testing tool for DNS over TCP

    - dane/

      mkdane.sh generates TLSA records for use with DNS-based
      Authentication of Named Entities (DANE)

    - dnspriv/

      Sample configuration for setting up a DNS-over-TLS server
      using BIND with Nginx as a TLS proxy

    - dlz/modules

      Dynamically linkable DLZ modules that can be configured into
      named at runtime, enabling access to external data sources including
      LDAP, MySQL, Berkeley DB, perl scripts, etc

    - dlz/drivers

      Old-style DLZ drivers that can be linked into named at compile
      time.  (These are no longer actively maintained and are expected
      to be deprecated eventually.)

    - sdb/

      SDB drivers: another mechanism for accessing external data
      sources. (These are no longer actively maintained and are
      expected to be deprecated eventually.)

    - idn/

      Contains source for 'idnkit', which provides support for
      Internationalized Domain Name processing.

    - dnsperf-2.1.0.0-1/
    - dnsperf-patches/

      DNS server performance testing tools, like 'queryperf' but more
      advanced: 'dnsperf' focuses on authoritative server performance
      and 'resperf' on recursive server performance.  The patch that
      adds support for EDNS Client Subnet can be found in dnsperf-patches
      directory.

Formerly, there was more software included in this directory, but we
have removed it in favour of using canonical upstream locations.  You
can find the links to the nslint, query-loc and zkt, and other software
we find useful but do not necessarily support, at:
