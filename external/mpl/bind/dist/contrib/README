This directory contains scripts, tools, and other useful accessories to
BIND 9.  Contrib software is not supported by ISC, but reported bugs will
be fixed as time permits.

    - scripts/

      Assorted useful scripts, including 'nanny' which monitors 
      named and restarts it in the event of a crash, 'zone-edit'
      which enables editing of a dynamic zone, and others.

    - dane/

      mkdane.sh generates TLSA records for use with DNS-based
      Authentication of Named Entities (DANE).

    - dnspriv/

      Sample configuration for setting up a DNS-over-TLS server
      using BIND with Nginx as a TLS proxy.

    - kasp/

      Scripts for converting key and signature policies from OpenDNSSEC
      KASP format to the policy.conf format used by dnssec-keymgr.

    - dlz/modules

      Dynamically linkable DLZ modules that can be configured into
      named at runtime, enabling access to external data sources including
      LDAP, MySQL, Berkeley DB, perl scripts, etc.

    - dlz/drivers

      Old-style DLZ drivers that can be linked into named at compile
      time. (These are no longer actively maintained and are expected
      to be removed eventually.)
