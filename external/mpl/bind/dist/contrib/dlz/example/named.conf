 * This is a sample named.conf file that uses the DLZ module defined in
 * dlz_example.c.  It sets up a zone 'example.nil' which can accept DDNS
 * updates.
 *
 * By default, when run, the zone contains the following records:
 *
 * example.nil.  3600    IN      SOA     example.nil. hostmaster.example.nil. (
 *                                               123 900 600 86400 3600
 *                                       )
 * example.nil.  3600    IN      NS      example.nil.
 * example.nil.  1800    IN      A       10.53.0.1
 *
 * Additionally, a query for 'source-addr.example.nil/TXT' is always
 * answered with the source address of the query.  This is used to
 * demonstrate the code that retrieves client information from the
 * caller.
 *
 * To use this driver, "dlz_external.so" must be moved into the working
 * directory for named.
