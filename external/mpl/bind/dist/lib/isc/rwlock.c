/*
 * When some architecture-dependent atomic operations are available,
 * rwlock can be more efficient than the generic algorithm defined below.
 * The basic algorithm is described in the following URL:
 *   http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/scott/synchronization/pseudocode/rw.html
 *
 * The key is to use the following integer variables modified atomically:
 *   write_requests, write_completions, and cnt_and_flag.
 *
 * write_requests and write_completions act as a waiting queue for writers
 * in order to ensure the FIFO order.  Both variables begin with the initial
 * value of 0.  When a new writer tries to get a write lock, it increments
 * write_requests and gets the previous value of the variable as a "ticket".
 * When write_completions reaches the ticket number, the new writer can start
 * writing.  When the writer completes its work, it increments
 * write_completions so that another new writer can start working.  If the
 * write_requests is not equal to write_completions, it means a writer is now
 * working or waiting.  In this case, a new readers cannot start reading, or
 * in other words, this algorithm basically prefers writers.
 *
 * cnt_and_flag is a "lock" shared by all readers and writers.  This integer
 * variable is a kind of structure with two members: writer_flag (1 bit) and
 * reader_count (31 bits).  The writer_flag shows whether a writer is working,
 * and the reader_count shows the number of readers currently working or almost
 * ready for working.  A writer who has the current "ticket" tries to get the
 * lock by exclusively setting the writer_flag to 1, provided that the whole
 * 32-bit is 0 (meaning no readers or writers working).  On the other hand,
 * a new reader tries to increment the "reader_count" field provided that
 * the writer_flag is 0 (meaning there is no writer working).
 *
 * If some of the above operations fail, the reader or the writer sleeps
 * until the related condition changes.  When a working reader or writer
 * completes its work, some readers or writers are sleeping, and the condition
 * that suspended the reader or writer has changed, it wakes up the sleeping
 * readers or writers.
 *
 * As already noted, this algorithm basically prefers writers.  In order to
 * prevent readers from starving, however, the algorithm also introduces the
 * "writer quota" (Q).  When Q consecutive writers have completed their work,
 * suspending readers, the last writer will wake up the readers, even if a new
 * writer is waiting.
 *
 * Implementation specific note: due to the combination of atomic operations
 * and a mutex lock, ordering between the atomic operation and locks can be
 * very sensitive in some cases.  In particular, it is generally very important
 * to check the atomic variable that requires a reader or writer to sleep after
 * locking the mutex and before actually sleeping; otherwise, it could be very
 * likely to cause a deadlock.  For example, assume "var" is a variable
 * atomically modified, then the corresponding code would be:
 *	if (var == need_sleep) {
 *		LOCK(lock);
 *		if (var == need_sleep)
 *			WAIT(cond, lock);
 *		UNLOCK(lock);
 *	}
 * The second check is important, since "var" is protected by the atomic
 * operation, not by the mutex, and can be changed just before sleeping.
 * (The first "if" could be omitted, but this is also important in order to
 * make the code efficient by avoiding the use of the mutex unless it is
 * really necessary.)
