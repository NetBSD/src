/*!<
 * \brief Calculate a hash over data.
 *
 * This hash function is useful for hashtables. The hash function is
 * opaque and not important to the caller. The returned hash values are
 * non-deterministic and will have different mapping every time a
 * process using this library is run, but will have uniform
 * distribution.
 *
 * isc_hash_function() calculates the hash from start to end over the
 * input data.
 *
 * 'data' is the data to be hashed.
 *
 * 'length' is the size of the data to be hashed.
 *
 * 'case_sensitive' specifies whether the hash key should be treated as
 * case_sensitive values.  It should typically be false if the hash key
 * is a DNS name.
 *
 * WARNING: In case of case insensitive input, the input buffer cannot
 * be longer than 1024, which should be fine, as it is only used for
 * DNS names.
