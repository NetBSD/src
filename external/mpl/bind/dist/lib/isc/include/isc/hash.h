/*!<
 * \brief Calculate a hash over data.
 *
 * This hash function is useful for hashtables. The hash function is
 * opaque and not important to the caller. The returned hash values are
 * non-deterministic and will have different mapping every time a
 * process using this library is run, but will have uniform
 * distribution.
 *
 * isc_hash_function() calculates the hash from start to end over the
 * input data. isc_hash_function_reverse() calculates the hash from the
 * end to the start over the input data. The difference in order is
 * useful in incremental hashing; for example, a previously hashed
 * value for 'com' can be used as input when hashing 'example.com'.
 *
 * 'data' is the data to be hashed.
 *
 * 'length' is the size of the data to be hashed.
 *
 * 'case_sensitive' specifies whether the hash key should be treated as
 * case_sensitive values.  It should typically be false if the hash key
 * is a DNS name.
 *
 * 'previous_hashp' is a pointer to a previous hash value returned by
 * this function. It can be used to perform incremental hashing. NULL
 * must be passed during first calls.
