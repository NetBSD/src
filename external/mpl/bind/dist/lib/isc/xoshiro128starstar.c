 * This is xoshiro128** 1.0, our 32-bit all-purpose, rock-solid generator.
 * It has excellent (sub-ns) speed, a state size (128 bits) that is large
 * enough for mild parallelism, and it passes all tests we are aware of.
 *
 * For generating just single-precision (i.e., 32-bit) floating-point
 * numbers, xoshiro128+ is even faster.
 *
 * The state must be seeded so that it is not everywhere zero.
