/*! \file isc/trampoline_p.h
 * \brief isc__trampoline: allows safe reuse of thread ID numbers.
 *
 * The 'isc_hp' hazard pointer API uses an internal thread ID
 * variable ('tid_v') that is incremented for each new thread that uses
 * hazard pointers. This thread ID is then used as an index into a global
 * shared table of hazard pointer state.
 *
 * Since the thread ID is only incremented and never decremented, the
 * table can overflow if threads are frequently created and destroyed.
 *
 * A trampoline is a thin wrapper around any function to be called from
 * a newly launched thread. It maintains a table of thread IDs used by
 * current and previous threads; when a thread is destroyed, its slot in
 * the trampoline table becomes available, and the next thread to occupy
 * that slot can use the same thread ID that its predecessor did.
 *
 * The trampoline table initially has space for 64 worker threads in
 * addition to the main thread. If more threads than that are in
 * concurrent use, the table is reallocated with twice as much space.
 * (Note that the number of concurrent threads is currently capped at
 * 128 by the queue and hazard pointer implementations.)
