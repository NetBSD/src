/*! \file
 *
 * \brief
 * The DNS client module provides convenient programming interfaces to various
 * DNS services, such as name resolution with or without DNSSEC validation or
 * dynamic DNS update.  This module is primarily expected to be used by other
 * applications than BIND9-related ones that need such advanced DNS features.
 *
 * MP:
 *\li	In the typical usage of this module, application threads will not share
 *	the same data structures created and manipulated in this module.
 *	However, the module still ensures appropriate synchronization of such
 *	data structures.
 *
 * Resources:
 *\li	TBS
 *
 * Security:
 *\li	This module does not handle any low-level data directly, and so no
 *	security issue specific to this module is anticipated.

 * If any trusted keys are configured and the query name is considered to

 * using DNSSEC by default.  If the DNS_CLIENTRESOPT_NOVALIDATE flag is set
 * in 'options', DNSSEC validation is disabled regardless of the configured
 * trusted keys or the query name. With DNS_CLIENTRESOPT_NODNSSEC
 * DNSSEC data is not returned with response. DNS_CLIENTRESOPT_NOCDFLAG
 * disables the CD flag on queries, DNS_CLIENTRESOPT_TCP switches to
 * the TCP (vs. UDP) transport.
 *
 * dns_client_resolve() provides a synchronous service.  This function starts
 * name resolution internally and blocks until it completes.  On success,
 * 'namelist' will contain a list of answer names, each of which has
 * corresponding RRsets.  The caller must provide a valid empty list, and
 * is responsible for freeing the list content via dns_client_freeresanswer().
 * If the name resolution fails due to an error in DNSSEC validation,
 * dns_client_resolve() returns the result code indicating the validation
 * error. Otherwise, it returns the result code of the entire resolution
 * process, either success or failure.
 *
 * It is expected that the client object passed to dns_client_resolve() was
 * created via dns_client_create() and has external managers and contexts.
 *
 * dns_client_startresolve() is an asynchronous version of dns_client_resolve()
 * and does not block.  When name resolution is completed, 'action' will be
 * called with the argument of a 'dns_clientresevent_t' object, which contains
 * the resulting list of answer names (on success).  On return, '*transp' is
 * set to an opaque transaction ID so that the caller can cancel this
 * resolution process.
