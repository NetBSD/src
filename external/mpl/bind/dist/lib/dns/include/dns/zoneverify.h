 * Verify that certain things are sane:
 *
 *   The apex has a DNSKEY record with at least one KSK, and at least
 *   one ZSK if the -x flag was not used.
 *
 *   The DNSKEY record was signed with at least one of the KSKs in this
 *   set.
 *
 *   The rest of the zone was signed with at least one of the ZSKs
 *   present in the DNSKEY RRSET.
 *
 * Mark all RRsets correctly signed by one of the keys in the DNSKEY RRset at
 * zone apex as secure.
 *
 * If 'secroots' is not NULL, mark the DNSKEY RRset as secure if it is
 * correctly signed by at least one key present in 'secroots'.
