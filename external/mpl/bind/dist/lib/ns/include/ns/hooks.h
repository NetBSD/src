/*
 * "Hooks" are a mechanism to call a defined function or set of functions once
 * a certain place in code is reached.  Hook actions can inspect and alter the
 * state of an ongoing process, allowing processing to continue afterward or
 * triggering an early return.
 *
 * Currently hooks are used in two ways: in plugins, which use them to
 * add functionality to query processing, and in the unit tests for libns,
 * where they are used to inspect state before and after certain functions have
 * run.
 *
 * Both of these uses are limited to libns, so hooks are currently defined in
 * the ns/hooks.h header file, and hook-related macro and function names are
 * prefixed with `NS_` and `ns_`.  However, the design is fairly generic and
 * could be repurposed for general use, e.g. as part of libisc, after some
 * further customization.
 *
 * Hooks are created by defining a hook point identifier in the ns_hookpoint_t
 * enum below, and placing a special call at a corresponding location in the
 * code which invokes the action(s) for that hook; there are two such special
 * calls currently implemented, namely the CALL_HOOK() and CALL_HOOK_NORETURN()
 * macros in query.c.  The former macro contains a "goto cleanup" statement
 * which is inlined into the function into which the hook has been inserted;
 * this enables the hook action to cause the calling function to return from
 * the hook insertion point.  For functions returning isc_result_t, if a hook
 * action intends to cause a return at hook insertion point, it also has to set
 * the value to be returned by the calling function.
 *
 * A hook table is an array (indexed by the value of the hook point identifier)
 * in which each cell contains a linked list of structures, each of which
 * contains a function pointer to a hook action and a pointer to data which is
 * to be passed to the action function when it is called.
 *
 * Each view has its own separate hook table, populated by loading plugin
 * modules specified in the "plugin" statements in named.conf.  There is also a
 * special, global hook table (ns__hook_table) that is only used by libns unit
 * tests and whose existence can be safely ignored by plugin modules.
 *
 * Hook actions are functions which:
 *
 *   - return an ns_hookresult_t value:
 *       - if NS_HOOK_RETURN is returned by the hook action, the function
 *         into which the hook is inserted will return and no further hook
 *         actions at the same hook point will be invoked,
 *       - if NS_HOOK_CONTINUE is returned by the hook action and there are
 *         further hook actions set up at the same hook point, they will be
 *         processed; if NS_HOOK_CONTINUE is returned and there are no
 *         further hook actions set up at the same hook point, execution of
 *         the function into which the hook has been inserted will be
 *         resumed.
 *
 *   - accept three pointers as arguments:
 *       - a pointer specified by the special call at the hook insertion point,
 *       - a pointer specified upon inserting the action into the hook table,
 *       - a pointer to an isc_result_t value which will be returned by the
 *         function into which the hook is inserted if the action returns
 *         NS_HOOK_RETURN.
 *
 * In order for a hook action to be called for a given hook, a pointer to that
 * action function (along with an optional pointer to action-specific data) has
 * to be inserted into the relevant hook table entry for that hook using an
 * ns_hook_add() call.  If multiple actions are set up at a single hook point
 * (e.g. by multiple plugin modules), they are processed in FIFO order, that is
 * they are performed in the same order in which their relevant ns_hook_add()
 * calls were issued.  Since the configuration is loaded from a single thread,
 * this means that multiple actions at a single hook point are determined by
 * the order in which the relevant plugin modules were declared in the
 * configuration file(s).  The hook API currently does not support changing
 * this order.
 *
 * As an example, consider the following hypothetical function in query.c:
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * static isc_result_t
 * query_foo(query_ctx_t *qctx) {
 *     isc_result_t result;
 *
 *     CALL_HOOK(NS_QUERY_FOO_BEGIN, qctx);
 *
 *     ns_client_log(qctx->client, NS_LOGCATEGORY_CLIENT, NS_LOGMODULE_QUERY,
 *                   ISC_LOG_DEBUG(99), "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...");
 *
 *     result = ISC_R_COMPLETE;
 *
 *  cleanup:
 *     return (result);
 * }
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * and the following hook action:
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * static ns_hookresult_t
 * cause_failure(void *hook_data, void *action_data, isc_result_t *resultp) {
 *     UNUSED(hook_data);
 *     UNUSED(action_data);
 *
 *     *resultp = ISC_R_FAILURE;
 *
 *     return (NS_HOOK_RETURN);
 * }
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * If this hook action was installed in the hook table using:
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * const ns_hook_t foo_fail = {
 *     .action = cause_failure,
 * };
 *
 * ns_hook_add(..., NS_QUERY_FOO_BEGIN, &foo_fail);
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * then query_foo() would return ISC_R_FAILURE every time it is called due
 * to the cause_failure() hook action returning NS_HOOK_RETURN and setting
 * '*resultp' to ISC_R_FAILURE.  query_foo() would also never log the
 * "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..." message.
 *
 * Consider a different hook action:
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * static ns_hookresult_t
 * log_qtype(void *hook_data, void *action_data, isc_result_t *resultp) {
 *     query_ctx_t *qctx = (query_ctx_t *)hook_data;
 *     FILE *stream = (FILE *)action_data;
 *
 *     UNUSED(resultp);
 *
 *     fprintf(stream, "QTYPE=%u\n", qctx->qtype);
 *
 *     return (NS_HOOK_CONTINUE);
 * }
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * If this hook action was installed in the hook table instead of
 * cause_failure(), using:
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * const ns_hook_t foo_log_qtype = {
 *     .action = log_qtype,
 *     .action_data = stderr,
 * };
 *
 * ns_hook_add(..., NS_QUERY_FOO_BEGIN, &foo_log_qtype);
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * then the QTYPE stored in the query context passed to query_foo() would be
 * logged to stderr upon each call to that function; 'qctx' would be passed to
 * the hook action in 'hook_data' since it is specified in the CALL_HOOK() call
 * inside query_foo() while stderr would be passed to the hook action in
 * 'action_data' since it is specified in the ns_hook_t structure passed to
 * ns_hook_add().  As the hook action returns NS_HOOK_CONTINUE,
 * query_foo() would also be logging the "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..."
 * message before returning ISC_R_COMPLETE.
 *
 * ASYNCHRONOUS EVENT HANDLING IN QUERY HOOKS
 *
 * Usually a hook action works synchronously; it completes some particular
 * job in the middle of query processing, thus blocking the caller (and the
 * worker thread handling the query).  But sometimes an action can be time
 * consuming and the blocking behavior may not be acceptable.  For example,
 * a hook may need to send some kind of query (like a DB lookup) to an
 * external backend server and wait for the response to complete the hook's
 * action.  Depending on the network condition, the external server's load,
 * etc, it may take several seconds or more.
 *
 * In order to handle such a situation, a hook action can start an
 * asynchronous event by calling ns_query_hookasync().  This is similar
 * to ns_query_recurse(), but more generic.  ns_query_hookasync() will
 * call the 'runasync' function with a specified 'arg' (both passed to
 * ns_query_hookasync()) and a set of task and associated event arguments
 * to be called to resume query handling upon completion of the
 * asynchronous event.
 *
 * The implementation of 'runasync' is assumed to allocate and build an
 * instance of ns_hook_resevent_t whose action, arg, and task are set to
 * the passed values from ns_query_hookasync().  Other fields of
 * ns_hook_resevent_t must be correctly set in the hook implementation
 * by the time it's sent to the specified task:
 *
 * - hookpoint: the point from which the query handling should be resumed
 *   (which should usually be the hook point that triggered the asynchronous
 *   event).
 * - origresult: the result code passed to the hook action that triggers the
 *   asynchronous event through the 'resultp' pointer.  Some hook points need
 *   this value to correctly resume the query handling.
 * - saved_qctx: the 'qctx' passed to 'runasync'.  This holds some
 *   intermediate data for resolving the query, and will be used to resume the
 *   query handling.  The 'runasync' implementation must not modify it.
 *
 * The hook implementation should somehow maintain the created event
 * instance so that it can eventually send the event.
 *
 * 'runasync' then creates an instance of ns_hookasync_t with specifying its
 * own cancel and destroy function, and returns it to ns_query_hookasync()
 * in the passed pointer.
 *
 * On return from ns_query_hookasync(), the hook action MUST return
 * NS_HOOK_RETURN to suspend the query handling.
 *
 * On the completion of the asynchronous event, the hook implementation is
 * supposed to send the resumeevent to the corresponding task.  The query
 * module resumes the query handling so that the hook action of the
 * specified hook point will be called, skipping some intermediate query
 * handling steps.  So, typically, the same hook action will be called
 * twice.  The hook implementation must somehow remember the context, and
 * handle the second call to complete its action using the result of the
 * asynchronous event.
 *
 * Example: assume the following hook-specific structure to manage
 * asynchronous events:
 *
 * typedef struct hookstate {
 * 	bool async;
 *	ns_hook_resevent_t *rev
 *	ns_hookpoint_t hookpoint;
 *	isc_result_t origresult;
 * } hookstate_t;
 *
 * 'async' is supposed to be true if and only if hook-triggered
 * asynchronous processing is taking place.
 *
 * A hook action that uses an asynchronous event would look something
 * like this:
 *
 * hook_recurse(void *hook_data, void *action_data, isc_result_t *resultp) {
 *	hookstate_t *state = somehow_retrieve_from(action_data);
 *	if (state->async) {
 *		// just resumed from an asynchronous hook action.
 *		// complete the hook's action using the result of the
 *		// internal asynchronous event.
 *		state->async = false;
 *		return (NS_HOOK_CONTINUE);
 *	}
 *
 *	// Initial call to the hook action.  Start the internal
 *	// asynchronous event, and have the query module suspend
 *	// its own handling by returning NS_HOOK_RETURN.
 *	state->hookpoint = ...; // would be hook point for this hook
 *	state->origresult = *resultp;
 *	ns_query_hookasync(hook_data, runasync, state);
 *	state->async = true;
 *	return (NS_HOOK_RETURN);
 * }
 *
 * And the 'runasync' function would be something like this:
 *
 * static isc_result_t
 * runasync(query_ctx_t *qctx, void *arg, isc_taskaction_t action,
 *	    void *evarg, isc_task_t *task, ns_hookasync_t **ctxp) {
 * 	hookstate_t *state = arg;
 *	ns_hook_resevent_t *rev = isc_event_allocate(
 *		mctx, task, NS_EVENT_HOOKASYNCDONE, action, evarg,
 *		sizeof(*rev));
 *	ns_hookasync_t *ctx = isc_mem_get(mctx, sizeof(*ctx));
 *
 *	*ctx = (ns_hookasync_t){ .private = NULL };
 *	isc_mem_attach(mctx, &ctx->mctx);
 *	ctx->cancel = ...;  // set the cancel function, which cancels the
 *			    // internal asynchronous event (if necessary).
 *			    // it should eventually result in sending
 *			    // the 'rev' event to the calling task.
 *	ctx->destroy = ...; // set the destroy function, which frees 'ctx'
 *
 *	rev->hookpoint = state->hookpoint;
 *	rev->origresult = state->origresult;
 *	rev->saved_qctx = qctx;
 *	rev->ctx = ctx;
 *
 *	state->rev = rev; // store the resume event so we can send it later
 *
 *	// initiate some asynchronous process here - for example, a
 *	// recursive fetch.
 *
 *	*ctxp = ctx;
 *	return (ISC_R_SUCCESS);
 * }
 *
 * Finally, in the completion handler for the asynchronous process, we
 * need to send a resumption event so that query processing can resume.
 * For example, the completion handler might call this function:
 *
 * static void
 * asyncproc_done(hookstate_t *state) {
 *	isc_event_t *ev = (isc_event_t *)state->rev;
 *	isc_task_send(ev->ev_sender, &ev);
 * }
 *
 * Caveats:
 * - On resuming from a hook-initiated asynchronous process, code in
 *   the query module before the hook point needs to be exercised.
 *   So if this part has side effects, it's possible that the resuming
 *   doesn't work well.  Currently, NS_QUERY_RESPOND_ANY_FOUND is
 *   explicitly prohibited to be used as the resume point.
 * - In general, hooks other than those called at the beginning of the
 *   caller function may not work safely with asynchronous processing for
 *   the reason stated in the previous bullet.  For example, a hook action
 *   for NS_QUERY_DONE_SEND may not be able to start an asychronous
 *   function safely.
 * - Hook-triggered asynchronous processing is not allowed to be running
 *   while the standard DNS recursive fetch is taking place (starting
 *   from a call to dns_resolver_createfetch()), as the two would be
 *   using some of the same context resources.  For this reason the
 *   NS_QUERY_NOTFOUND_RECURSE and NS_QUERY_ZEROTTL_RECURSE hook points
 *   are explicitly prohibited from being used for asynchronous hook
 *   actions.
 * - Specifying multiple hook actions for the same hook point at the
 *   same time may cause problems, as resumption from one hook action
 *   could cause another hook to be called twice unintentionally.
 *   It's generally not safe to assume such a use case works,
 *   especially if the hooks are developed independently. (Note that
 *   that's not necessarily specific to the use of asynchronous hook
 *   actions. As long as hook actions have side effects, including
 *   modifying the internal query state, it's not guaranteed safe
 *   to use multiple independent hooks at the same time.)
