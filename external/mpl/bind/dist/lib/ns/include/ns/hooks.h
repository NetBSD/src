/*
 * "Hooks" are a mechanism to call a defined function or set of functions once
 * a certain place in code is reached.  Hook actions can inspect and alter the
 * state of an ongoing process, allowing processing to continue afterward or
 * triggering an early return.
 *
 * Currently hooks are used in two ways: in plugins, which use them to
 * add functionality to query processing, and in the unit tests for libns,
 * where they are used to inspect state before and after certain functions have
 * run.
 *
 * Both of these uses are limited to libns, so hooks are currently defined in
 * the ns/hooks.h header file, and hook-related macro and function names are
 * prefixed with `NS_` and `ns_`.  However, the design is fairly generic and
 * could be repurposed for general use, e.g. as part of libisc, after some
 * further customization.
 *
 * Hooks are created by defining a hook point identifier in the ns_hookpoint_t
 * enum below, and placing a special call at a corresponding location in the
 * code which invokes the action(s) for that hook; there are two such special
 * calls currently implemented, namely the CALL_HOOK() and CALL_HOOK_NORETURN()
 * macros in query.c.  The former macro contains a "goto cleanup" statement
 * which is inlined into the function into which the hook has been inserted;
 * this enables the hook action to cause the calling function to return from
 * the hook insertion point.  For functions returning isc_result_t, if a hook
 * action intends to cause a return at hook insertion point, it also has to set
 * the value to be returned by the calling function.
 *
 * A hook table is an array (indexed by the value of the hook point identifier)
 * in which each cell contains a linked list of structures, each of which
 * contains a function pointer to a hook action and a pointer to data which is
 * to be passed to the action function when it is called.
 *
 * Each view has its own separate hook table, populated by loading plugin
 * modules specified in the "plugin" statements in named.conf.  There is also a
 * special, global hook table (ns__hook_table) that is only used by libns unit
 * tests and whose existence can be safely ignored by plugin modules.
 *
 * Hook actions are functions which:
 *
 *   - return an ns_hookresult_t value:
 *       - if NS_HOOK_RETURN is returned by the hook action, the function
 *         into which the hook is inserted will return and no further hook
 *         actions at the same hook point will be invoked,
 *       - if NS_HOOK_CONTINUE is returned by the hook action and there are
 *         further hook actions set up at the same hook point, they will be
 *         processed; if NS_HOOK_CONTINUE is returned and there are no
 *         further hook actions set up at the same hook point, execution of
 *         the function into which the hook has been inserted will be
 *         resumed.
 *
 *   - accept three pointers as arguments:
 *       - a pointer specified by the special call at the hook insertion point,
 *       - a pointer specified upon inserting the action into the hook table,
 *       - a pointer to an isc_result_t value which will be returned by the
 *         function into which the hook is inserted if the action returns
 *         NS_HOOK_RETURN.
 *
 * In order for a hook action to be called for a given hook, a pointer to that
 * action function (along with an optional pointer to action-specific data) has
 * to be inserted into the relevant hook table entry for that hook using an
 * ns_hook_add() call.  If multiple actions are set up at a single hook point
 * (e.g. by multiple plugin modules), they are processed in FIFO order, that is
 * they are performed in the same order in which their relevant ns_hook_add()
 * calls were issued.  Since the configuration is loaded from a single thread,
 * this means that multiple actions at a single hook point are determined by
 * the order in which the relevant plugin modules were declared in the
 * configuration file(s).  The hook API currently does not support changing
 * this order.
 *
 * As an example, consider the following hypothetical function in query.c:
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * static isc_result_t
 * query_foo(query_ctx_t *qctx) {
 *     isc_result_t result;
 *
 *     CALL_HOOK(NS_QUERY_FOO_BEGIN, qctx);
 *
 *     ns_client_log(qctx->client, NS_LOGCATEGORY_CLIENT, NS_LOGMODULE_QUERY,
 *                   ISC_LOG_DEBUG(99), "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...");
 *
 *     result = ISC_R_COMPLETE;
 *
 *  cleanup:
 *     return (result);
 * }
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * and the following hook action:
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * static ns_hookresult_t
 * cause_failure(void *hook_data, void *action_data, isc_result_t *resultp) {
 *     UNUSED(hook_data);
 *     UNUSED(action_data);
 *
 *     *resultp = ISC_R_FAILURE;
 *
 *     return (NS_HOOK_RETURN);
 * }
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * If this hook action was installed in the hook table using:
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * const ns_hook_t foo_fail = {
 *     .action = cause_failure,
 * };
 *
 * ns_hook_add(..., NS_QUERY_FOO_BEGIN, &foo_fail);
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * then query_foo() would return ISC_R_FAILURE every time it is called due
 * to the cause_failure() hook action returning NS_HOOK_RETURN and setting
 * '*resultp' to ISC_R_FAILURE.  query_foo() would also never log the
 * "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..." message.
 *
 * Consider a different hook action:
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * static ns_hookresult_t
 * log_qtype(void *hook_data, void *action_data, isc_result_t *resultp) {
 *     query_ctx_t *qctx = (query_ctx_t *)hook_data;
 *     FILE *stream = (FILE *)action_data;
 *
 *     UNUSED(resultp);
 *
 *     fprintf(stream, "QTYPE=%u\n", qctx->qtype);
 *
 *     return (NS_HOOK_CONTINUE);
 * }
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * If this hook action was installed in the hook table instead of
 * cause_failure(), using:
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * const ns_hook_t foo_log_qtype = {
 *     .action = log_qtype,
 *     .action_data = stderr,
 * };
 *
 * ns_hook_add(..., NS_QUERY_FOO_BEGIN, &foo_log_qtype);
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * then the QTYPE stored in the query context passed to query_foo() would be
 * logged to stderr upon each call to that function; 'qctx' would be passed to
 * the hook action in 'hook_data' since it is specified in the CALL_HOOK() call
 * inside query_foo() while stderr would be passed to the hook action in
 * 'action_data' since it is specified in the ns_hook_t structure passed to
 * ns_hook_add().  As the hook action returns NS_HOOK_CONTINUE,
 * query_foo() would also be logging the "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..."
 * message before returning ISC_R_COMPLETE.
