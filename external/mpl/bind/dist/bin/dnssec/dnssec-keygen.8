.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdnssec\-keygen\fR
generates keys for DNSSEC (Secure DNS), as defined in RFC 2535 and RFC 4034\&. It can also generate keys for use with TSIG (Transaction Signatures) as defined in RFC 2845, or TKEY (Transaction Key) as defined in RFC 2930\&.
.PP
The
\fBname\fR
of the key is specified on the command line\&. For DNSSEC keys, this must match the name of the zone for which the key is being generated\&.
.PP
The
\fBdnssec\-keymgr\fR
command acts as a wrapper around
\fBdnssec\-keygen\fR, generating and updating keys as needed to enforce defined security policies such as key rollover scheduling\&. Using
\fBdnssec\-keymgr\fR
may be preferable to direct use of
\fBdnssec\-keygen\fR\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-3
.RS 4
Use an NSEC3\-capable algorithm to generate a DNSSEC key\&. If this option is used with an algorithm that has both NSEC and NSEC3 versions, then the NSEC3 version will be used; for example,
\fBdnssec\-keygen \-3a RSASHA1\fR
specifies the NSEC3RSASHA1 algorithm\&.
.RE
.PP
\-a \fIalgorithm\fR
.RS 4
Selects the cryptographic algorithm\&. For DNSSEC keys, the value of
\fBalgorithm\fR
must be one of RSASHA1, NSEC3RSASHA1, RSASHA256, RSASHA512, ECDSAP256SHA256, ECDSAP384SHA384, ED25519 or ED448\&. For TKEY, the value must be DH (Diffie Hellman); specifying his value will automatically set the
\fB\-T KEY\fR
option as well\&.
.sp
These values are case insensitive\&. In some cases, abbreviations are supported, such as ECDSA256 for ECDSAP256SHA256 and ECDSA384 for ECDSAP384SHA384\&. If RSASHA1 is specified along with the
\fB\-3\fR
option, then NSEC3RSASHA1 will be used instead\&.
.sp
This parameter
\fImust\fR
be specified except when using the
\fB\-S\fR
option, which copies the algorithm from the predecessor key\&.
.sp
In prior releases, HMAC algorithms could be generated for use as TSIG keys, but that feature has been removed as of BIND 9\&.13\&.0\&. Use
\fBtsig\-keygen\fR
to generate TSIG keys\&.
.RE
.PP
\-b \fIkeysize\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the number of bits in the key\&. The choice of key size depends on the algorithm used\&. RSA keys must be between 1024 and 4096 bits\&. Diffie Hellman keys must be between 128 and 4096 bits\&. Elliptic curve algorithms don\*(Aqt need this parameter\&.
.sp
If the key size is not specified, some algorithms have pre\-defined defaults\&. For example, RSA keys for use as DNSSEC zone signing keys have a default size of 1024 bits; RSA keys for use as key signing keys (KSKs, generated with
\fB\-f KSK\fR) default to 2048 bits\&.
.RE
.PP
\-C
.RS 4
Compatibility mode: generates an old\-style key, without any timing metadata\&. By default,
\fBdnssec\-keygen\fR
will include the key\*(Aqs creation date in the metadata stored with the private key, and other dates may be set there as well (publication date, activation date, etc)\&. Keys that include this data may be incompatible with older versions of BIND; the
\fB\-C\fR
option suppresses them\&.
.RE
.PP
\-c \fIclass\fR
.RS 4
Indicates that the DNS record containing the key should have the specified class\&. If not specified, class IN is used\&.
.RE
.PP
\-E \fIengine\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the cryptographic hardware to use, when applicable\&.
.sp
When BIND is built with OpenSSL PKCS#11 support, this defaults to the string "pkcs11", which identifies an OpenSSL engine that can drive a cryptographic accelerator or hardware service module\&. When BIND is built with native PKCS#11 cryptography (\-\-enable\-native\-pkcs11), it defaults to the path of the PKCS#11 provider library specified via "\-\-with\-pkcs11"\&.
.RE
.PP
\-f \fIflag\fR
.RS 4
Set the specified flag in the flag field of the KEY/DNSKEY record\&. The only recognized flags are KSK (Key Signing Key) and REVOKE\&.
.RE
.PP
\-G
.RS 4
Generate a key, but do not publish it or sign with it\&. This option is incompatible with \-P and \-A\&.
.RE
.PP
\-g \fIgenerator\fR
.RS 4
If generating a Diffie Hellman key, use this generator\&. Allowed values are 2 and 5\&. If no generator is specified, a known prime from RFC 2539 will be used if possible; otherwise the default is 2\&.
.RE
.PP
\-h
.RS 4
Prints a short summary of the options and arguments to
\fBdnssec\-keygen\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-K \fIdirectory\fR
.RS 4
Sets the directory in which the key files are to be written\&.
.RE
.PP
\-L \fIttl\fR
.RS 4
Sets the default TTL to use for this key when it is converted into a DNSKEY RR\&. If the key is imported into a zone, this is the TTL that will be used for it, unless there was already a DNSKEY RRset in place, in which case the existing TTL would take precedence\&. If this value is not set and there is no existing DNSKEY RRset, the TTL will default to the SOA TTL\&. Setting the default TTL to
0
or
none
is the same as leaving it unset\&.
.RE
.PP
\-n \fInametype\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the owner type of the key\&. The value of
\fBnametype\fR
must either be ZONE (for a DNSSEC zone key (KEY/DNSKEY)), HOST or ENTITY (for a key associated with a host (KEY)), USER (for a key associated with a user(KEY)) or OTHER (DNSKEY)\&. These values are case insensitive\&. Defaults to ZONE for DNSKEY generation\&.
.RE
.PP
\-p \fIprotocol\fR
.RS 4
Sets the protocol value for the generated key, for use with
\fB\-T KEY\fR\&. The protocol is a number between 0 and 255\&. The default is 3 (DNSSEC)\&. Other possible values for this argument are listed in RFC 2535 and its successors\&.
.RE
.PP
\-q
.RS 4
Quiet mode: Suppresses unnecessary output, including progress indication\&. Without this option, when
\fBdnssec\-keygen\fR
is run interactively to generate an RSA or DSA key pair, it will print a string of symbols to
stderr
indicating the progress of the key generation\&. A \*(Aq\&.\*(Aq indicates that a random number has been found which passed an initial sieve test; \*(Aq+\*(Aq means a number has passed a single round of the Miller\-Rabin primality test; a space means that the number has passed all the tests and is a satisfactory key\&.
.RE
.PP
\-S \fIkey\fR
.RS 4
Create a new key which is an explicit successor to an existing key\&. The name, algorithm, size, and type of the key will be set to match the existing key\&. The activation date of the new key will be set to the inactivation date of the existing one\&. The publication date will be set to the activation date minus the prepublication interval, which defaults to 30 days\&.
.RE
.PP
\-s \fIstrength\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the strength value of the key\&. The strength is a number between 0 and 15, and currently has no defined purpose in DNSSEC\&.
.RE
.PP
\-T \fIrrtype\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the resource record type to use for the key\&.
\fBrrtype\fR
must be either DNSKEY or KEY\&. The default is DNSKEY when using a DNSSEC algorithm, but it can be overridden to KEY for use with SIG(0)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-t \fItype\fR
.RS 4
Indicates the use of the key, for use with
\fB\-T KEY\fR\&.
\fBtype\fR
must be one of AUTHCONF, NOAUTHCONF, NOAUTH, or NOCONF\&. The default is AUTHCONF\&. AUTH refers to the ability to authenticate data, and CONF the ability to encrypt data\&.
.RE
.PP
\-V
.RS 4
Prints version information\&.
.RE
.PP
\-v \fIlevel\fR
.RS 4
Sets the debugging level\&.
.RE
.SH "TIMING OPTIONS"
.PP
Dates can be expressed in the format YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS\&. If the argument begins with a \*(Aq+\*(Aq or \*(Aq\-\*(Aq, it is interpreted as an offset from the present time\&. For convenience, if such an offset is followed by one of the suffixes \*(Aqy\*(Aq, \*(Aqmo\*(Aq, \*(Aqw\*(Aq, \*(Aqd\*(Aq, \*(Aqh\*(Aq, or \*(Aqmi\*(Aq, then the offset is computed in years (defined as 365 24\-hour days, ignoring leap years), months (defined as 30 24\-hour days), weeks, days, hours, or minutes, respectively\&. Without a suffix, the offset is computed in seconds\&. To explicitly prevent a date from being set, use \*(Aqnone\*(Aq or \*(Aqnever\*(Aq\&.
.PP
\-P \fIdate/offset\fR
.RS 4
Sets the date on which a key is to be published to the zone\&. After that date, the key will be included in the zone but will not be used to sign it\&. If not set, and if the \-G option has not been used, the default is "now"\&.
.RE
.PP
\-P sync \fIdate/offset\fR
.RS 4
Sets the date on which CDS and CDNSKEY records that match this key are to be published to the zone\&.
.RE
.PP
\-A \fIdate/offset\fR
.RS 4
Sets the date on which the key is to be activated\&. After that date, the key will be included in the zone and used to sign it\&. If not set, and if the \-G option has not been used, the default is "now"\&. If set, if and \-P is not set, then the publication date will be set to the activation date minus the prepublication interval\&.
.RE
.PP
\-R \fIdate/offset\fR
.RS 4
Sets the date on which the key is to be revoked\&. After that date, the key will be flagged as revoked\&. It will be included in the zone and will be used to sign it\&.
.RE
.PP
\-I \fIdate/offset\fR
.RS 4
Sets the date on which the key is to be retired\&. After that date, the key will still be included in the zone, but it will not be used to sign it\&.
.RE
.PP
\-D \fIdate/offset\fR
.RS 4
Sets the date on which the key is to be deleted\&. After that date, the key will no longer be included in the zone\&. (It may remain in the key repository, however\&.)
.RE
.PP
\-D sync \fIdate/offset\fR
.RS 4
Sets the date on which the CDS and CDNSKEY records that match this key are to be deleted\&.
.RE
.PP
\-i \fIinterval\fR
.RS 4
Sets the prepublication interval for a key\&. If set, then the publication and activation dates must be separated by at least this much time\&. If the activation date is specified but the publication date isn\*(Aqt, then the publication date will default to this much time before the activation date; conversely, if the publication date is specified but activation date isn\*(Aqt, then activation will be set to this much time after publication\&.
.sp
If the key is being created as an explicit successor to another key, then the default prepublication interval is 30 days; otherwise it is zero\&.
.sp
As with date offsets, if the argument is followed by one of the suffixes \*(Aqy\*(Aq, \*(Aqmo\*(Aq, \*(Aqw\*(Aq, \*(Aqd\*(Aq, \*(Aqh\*(Aq, or \*(Aqmi\*(Aq, then the interval is measured in years, months, weeks, days, hours, or minutes, respectively\&. Without a suffix, the interval is measured in seconds\&.
.RE
.SH "GENERATED KEYS"
.PP
When
\fBdnssec\-keygen\fR
completes successfully, it prints a string of the form
Knnnn\&.+aaa+iiiii
to the standard output\&. This is an identification string for the key it has generated\&.
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
nnnn
is the key name\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3

aaa
is the numeric representation of the algorithm\&.
.RE

.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3

iiiii
is the key identifier (or footprint)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdnssec\-keygen\fR
creates two files, with names based on the printed string\&.
Knnnn\&.+aaa+iiiii\&.key
contains the public key, and
Knnnn\&.+aaa+iiiii\&.private
contains the private key\&.
.PP
The
\&.key
file contains a DNSKEY or KEY record\&. When a zone is being signed by
\fBnamed\fR
or
\fBdnssec\-signzone\fR\fB\-S\fR, DNSKEY records are included automatically\&. In other cases, the
\&.key
file can be inserted into a zone file manually or with a
\fB$INCLUDE\fR
statement\&.
.PP
The
\&.private
file contains algorithm\-specific fields\&. For obvious security reasons, this file does not have general read permission\&.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.PP
To generate an ECDSAP256SHA256 zone\-signing key for the zone
\fBexample\&.com\fR, issue the command:
.PP
\fBdnssec\-keygen \-a ECDSAP256SHA256 example\&.com\fR
.PP
The command would print a string of the form:
.PP
\fBKexample\&.com\&.+013+26160\fR
.PP
In this example,
\fBdnssec\-keygen\fR
creates the files
Kexample\&.com\&.+013+26160\&.key
and
Kexample\&.com\&.+013+26160\&.private\&.
.PP
To generate a matching key\-signing key, issue the command:
.PP
\fBdnssec\-keygen \-a ECDSAP256SHA256 \-f KSK example\&.com\fR
