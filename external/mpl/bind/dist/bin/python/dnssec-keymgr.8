.SH "NAME"
dnssec-keymgr \- Ensures correct DNSKEY coverage for a zone based on a defined policy
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

\fBdnssec\-keymgr\fR [\fB\-K\ \fR\fB\fIdirectory\fR\fR] [\fB\-c\ \fR\fB\fIfile\fR\fR] [\fB\-f\fR] [\fB\-k\fR] [\fB\-q\fR] [\fB\-v\fR] [\fB\-z\fR] [\fB\-g\ \fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR] [\fB\-r\ \fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR] [\fB\-s\ \fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR] [zone...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdnssec\-keymgr\fR
is a high level Python wrapper to facilitate the key rollover process for zones handled by BIND\&. It uses the BIND commands for manipulating DNSSEC key metadata:
\fBdnssec\-keygen\fR
and
\fBdnssec\-settime\fR\&.
.PP
DNSSEC policy can be read from a configuration file (default
/etc/dnssec\-policy\&.conf), from which the key parameters, publication and rollover schedule, and desired coverage duration for any given zone can be determined\&. This file may be used to define individual DNSSEC policies on a per\-zone basis, or to set a default policy used for all zones\&.
.PP
When
\fBdnssec\-keymgr\fR
runs, it examines the DNSSEC keys for one or more zones, comparing their timing metadata against the policies for those zones\&. If key settings do not conform to the DNSSEC policy (for example, because the policy has been changed), they are automatically corrected\&.
.PP
A zone policy can specify a duration for which we want to ensure the key correctness (\fBcoverage\fR)\&. It can also specify a rollover period (\fBroll\-period\fR)\&. If policy indicates that a key should roll over before the coverage period ends, then a successor key will automatically be created and added to the end of the key series\&.
.PP
If zones are specified on the command line,
\fBdnssec\-keymgr\fR
will examine only those zones\&. If a specified zone does not already have keys in place, then keys will be generated for it according to policy\&.
.PP
If zones are
\fInot\fR
specified on the command line, then
\fBdnssec\-keymgr\fR
will search the key directory (either the current working directory or the directory set by the
\fB\-K\fR
option), and check the keys for all the zones represented in the directory\&.
.PP
It is expected that this tool will be run automatically and unattended (for example, by
\fBcron\fR)\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-c \fIfile\fR
.RS 4
If
\fB\-c\fR
is specified, then the DNSSEC policy is read from
\fBfile\fR\&. (If not specified, then the policy is read from
/etc/dnssec\-policy\&.conf; if that file doesn\*(Aqt exist, a built\-in global default policy is used\&.)
.RE
.PP
\-f
.RS 4
Force: allow updating of key events even if they are already in the past\&. This is not recommended for use with zones in which keys have already been published\&. However, if a set of keys has been generated all of which have publication and activation dates in the past, but the keys have not been published in a zone as yet, then this option can be used to clean them up and turn them into a proper series of keys with appropriate rollover intervals\&.
.RE
.PP
\-g \fIkeygen\-path\fR

Specifies a path to a
\fBdnssec\-keygen\fR

Print the
\fBdnssec\-keymgr\fR
help summary and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-K \fIdirectory\fR
.RS 4
Sets the directory in which keys can be found\&. Defaults to the current working directory\&.
.RE
.PP
\-k

.RE

\fBdnssec\-settime\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-r \fIrandomdev\fR
.RS 4
Specifies a path to a file containing random data\&. This is passed to the
\fBdnssec\-keygen\fR
binary using its
\fB\-r\fR
option\&.
.RE
.PP
\-s \fIsettime\-path\fR
.RS 4
Specifies a path to a

.RE

.RE

.RS 4
Only apply policies to ZSK keys\&. See also the
\fB\-k\fR

.RE
.SH "POLICY CONFIGURATION"
.PP
The
dnssec\-policy\&.conf
file can specify three kinds of policies:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fIPolicy classes\fR
(\fBpolicy \fR\fB\fIname\fR\fR\fB { \&.\&.\&. };\fR) can be inherited by zone policies or other policy classes; these can be used to create sets of different security profiles\&. For example, a policy class
\fBnormal\fR
might specify 1024\-bit key sizes, but a class
\fBextra\fR
might specify 2048 bits instead;
\fBextra\fR
would be used for zones that had unusually high security needs\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Algorithm policies: (\fBalgorithm\-policy \fR\fB\fIalgorithm\fR\fR\fB { \&.\&.\&. };\fR
) override default per\-algorithm settings\&. For example, by default, RSASHA256 keys use 2048\-bit key sizes for both KSK and ZSK\&. This can be modified using
\fBalgorithm\-policy\fR, and the new key sizes would then be used for any key of type RSASHA256\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Zone policies: (\fBzone \fR\fB\fIname\fR\fR\fB { \&.\&.\&. };\fR
) set policy for a single zone by name\&. A zone policy can inherit a policy class by including a
\fBpolicy\fR
option\&. Zone names beginning with digits (i\&.e\&., 0\-9) must be quoted\&.
.RE
.PP
Options that can be specified in policies:
.PP
\fBalgorithm\fR
.RS 4
The key algorithm\&. If no policy is defined, the default is RSASHA256\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBcoverage\fR
.RS 4
The length of time to ensure that keys will be correct; no action will be taken to create new keys to be activated after this time\&. This can be represented as a number of seconds, or as a duration using human\-readable units (examples: "1y" or "6 months")\&. A default value for this option can be set in algorithm policies as well as in policy classes or zone policies\&. If no policy is configured, the default is six months\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdirectory\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the directory in which keys should be stored\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBkey\-size\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the number of bits to use in creating keys\&. Takes two arguments: keytype (eihter "zsk" or "ksk") and size\&. A default value for this option can be set in algorithm policies as well as in policy classes or zone policies\&. If no policy is configured, the default is 1024 bits for DSA keys and 2048 for RSA\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBkeyttl\fR
.RS 4
The key TTL\&. If no policy is defined, the default is one hour\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBpost\-publish\fR
.RS 4
How long after inactivation a key should be deleted from the zone\&. Note: If
\fBroll\-period\fR
is not set, this value is ignored\&. Takes two arguments: keytype (eihter "zsk" or "ksk") and a duration\&. A default value for this option can be set in algorithm policies as well as in policy classes or zone policies\&. The default is one month\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBpre\-publish\fR
.RS 4
How long before activation a key should be published\&. Note: If
\fBroll\-period\fR
is not set, this value is ignored\&. Takes two arguments: keytype (either "zsk" or "ksk") and a duration\&. A default value for this option can be set in algorithm policies as well as in policy classes or zone policies\&. The default is one month\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBroll\-period\fR
.RS 4
How frequently keys should be rolled over\&. Takes two arguments: keytype (eihter "zsk" or "ksk") and a duration\&. A default value for this option can be set in algorithm policies as well as in policy classes or zone policies\&. If no policy is configured, the default is one year for ZSK\*(Aqs\&. KSK\*(Aqs do not roll over by default\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBstandby\fR
.RS 4
Not yet implemented\&.

.SH "REMAINING WORK"
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c

Enable scheduling of KSK rollovers using the
\fB\-P sync\fR
and
\fB\-D sync\fR
options to
\fBdnssec\-keygen\fR
and
\fBdnssec\-settime\fR\&. Check the parent zone (as in
\fBdnssec\-checkds\fR) to determine when it\*(Aqs safe for the key to roll\&.
