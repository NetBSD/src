named-journalprint - print zone journal in human-readable form
--------------------------------------------------------------

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~

:program:`named-journalprint` [-c serial] [**-dux**] {journal}

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

``named-journalprint`` scans the contents of a zone journal file,
printing it in a human-readable form, or, optionally, converting it
to a different journal file format.

Journal files are automatically created by ``named`` when changes are
made to dynamic zones (e.g., by ``nsupdate``). They record each addition
or deletion of a resource record, in binary format, allowing the changes
to be re-applied to the zone when the server is restarted after a
shutdown or crash. By default, the name of the journal file is formed by
appending the extension ``.jnl`` to the name of the corresponding zone
file.

``named-journalprint`` converts the contents of a given journal file
into a human-readable text format. Each line begins with ``add`` or ``del``,
to indicate whether the record was added or deleted, and continues with
the resource record in master-file format.

The ``-c`` (compact) option provides a mechanism to reduce the size of
a journal by removing (most/all) transactions prior to the specified
serial number. Note: this option *must not* be used while ``named`` is
running, and can cause data loss if the zone file has not been updated
to contain the data being removed from the journal. Use with extreme caution.

The ``-x`` option causes additional data about the journal file to be
printed at the beginning of the output and before each group of changes.

The ``-u`` (upgrade) and ``-d`` (downgrade) options recreate the journal
file with a modified format version.  The existing journal file is
replaced.  ``-d`` writes out the journal in the format used by
versions of BIND up to 9.16.11; ``-u`` writes it out in the format used
by versions since 9.16.13. (9.16.12 is omitted due to a journal-formatting
bug in that release.) Note that these options *must not* be used while
``named`` is running.
