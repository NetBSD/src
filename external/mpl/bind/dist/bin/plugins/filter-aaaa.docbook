  <refsection><info><title>DESCRIPTION</title></info>
    <para>
      <command>filter-aaaa.so</command> is a query plugin module for
      <command>named</command>, enabling <command>named</command>
      to omit some IPv6 addresses when responding to clients.
    </para>
    <para>
      Until BIND 9.12, this feature was implemented natively in
      <command>named</command> and enabled with the
      <command>filter-aaaa</command> ACL and the
      <command>filter-aaaa-on-v4</command> and
      <command>filter-aaaa-on-v6</command> options. These options are
      now deprecated in <filename>named.conf</filename>, but can be
      passed as parameters to the <command>filter-aaaa.so</command>
      plugin, for example:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
plugin query "/usr/local/lib/filter-aaaa.so" {
        filter-aaaa-on-v4 yes;
        filter-aaaa-on-v6 yes;
        filter-aaaa { 192.0.2.1; 2001:db8:2::1; };
};
</programlisting>
    <para>
      This module is intended to aid transition from IPv4 to IPv6 by
      withholding IPv6 addresses from DNS clients which are not connected
      to the IPv6 Internet, when the name being looked up has an IPv4
      address available.  Use of this module is not recommended unless
      absolutely necessary.
    </para>
    <para>
      Note: This mechanism can erroneously cause other servers not to
      give AAAA records to their clients.  If a recursing server with
      both IPv6 and IPv4 network connections queries an authoritative
      server using this mechanism via IPv4, it will be denied AAAA
      records even if its client is using IPv6.
    </para>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><command>filter-aaaa</command></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Specifies a list of client addresses for which AAAA
	    filtering is to be applied.  The default is
	    <userinput>any</userinput>.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><command>filter-aaaa-on-v4</command></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    If set to <userinput>yes</userinput>, the DNS client is
	    at an IPv4 address, in <command>filter-aaaa</command>,
	    and if the response does not include DNSSEC signatures,
	    then all AAAA records are deleted from the response.
	    This filtering applies to all responses and not only
	    authoritative responses.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If set to <userinput>break-dnssec</userinput>,
	    then AAAA records are deleted even when DNSSEC is
	    enabled.  As suggested by the name, this causes the
	    response to fail to verify, because the DNSSEC protocol is
	    designed to detect deletions.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    This mechanism can erroneously cause other servers not to
	    give AAAA records to their clients.  A recursing server with
	    both IPv6 and IPv4 network connections that queries an
	    authoritative server using this mechanism via IPv4 will be
	    denied AAAA records even if its client is using IPv6.

	  <para>
	    Identical to <command>filter-aaaa-on-v4</command>,
	    except it filters AAAA responses to queries from IPv6
	    clients instead of IPv4 clients.  To filter all
	    responses, set both options to <userinput>yes</userinput>.
