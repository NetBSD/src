# We need a separate instance for the "rndc reconfig" test in order to
# ensure that it does not use ephemeral keys (these are costly to
# generate) and creates a minimal amount of TLS contexts, reducing the
# time needed for startup/reconfiguration. Long
# startup/reconfiguration was known to cause timeout issues in the CI
# system, where many tests run in parallel.
