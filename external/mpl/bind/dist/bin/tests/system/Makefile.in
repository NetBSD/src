# Running the scripts below is bypassed when a separate build directory is

# be greater than the highest privileged port, 1024.

# Test names need to be sanitized because Solaris make does not like
# underscores in target names and requires explicit differentiation
# between a target name and a directory name (.PHONY is not supported).
