    in order simulate a slightly more realistic test scenario.

    The main idea of this function is to create and send a bunch
    of A queries to a target named instance and during this process
    a request for shutting down named will be issued.

    In the process of shutting down named, a couple control connections
    are created (by launching rndc) to ensure that the crash was fixed.

    if kill_method=="rndc" named will be asked to shutdown by
    means of rndc stop.
    if kill_method=="sigterm" named will be killed by SIGTERM on
    POSIX systems or by TerminateProcess() on Windows systems.
