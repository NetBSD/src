This is for testing managed-keys, in particular with problems
with RFC 5011 Automated Updates of DNSSEC Trust Anchors.

ns1 is the root server that offers new KSKs and hosts one record for
testing. The TTL for the zone's records is 2 seconds.

ns2 is a validator that uses managed-keys.  "-T mkeytimers=2/20/40"
is used so it will attempt do automated updates frequently. "-T tat=1"
is used so it will send TAT queries once per second.

ns3 is a validator with a broken key in managed-keys.

ns4 is a validator with a deliberately broken managed-keys.bind and
managed-keys.jnl, causing RFC 5011 initialization to fail.

ns5 is a validator which is prevented from getting a response from the
root server, causing key refresh queries to fail.

ns6 is a validator which has unsupported algorithms, one at start up,
one because of an algorithm rollover.

ns7 is a validator with multiple views configured.  It is used for
testing per-view rndc commands and checking interactions between options
related to and potentially affecting RFC 5011 processing.
