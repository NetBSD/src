	# This key (20326) was published in the root zone in 2017.
	# Servers which were already using the old key (19036) should
	# roll seamlessly to this new one via RFC 5011 rollover. Servers
	# being set up for the first time can use the contents of this
	# file as initializing keys; thereafter, the keys in the
	# managed key database will be trusted and maintained
	# automatically.
