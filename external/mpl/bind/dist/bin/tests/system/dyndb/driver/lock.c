 * All calls to isc_task_beginexclusive() have to operate on the same task
 * otherwise it would not be possible to distinguish recursive locking
 * from real conflict on the dispatcher lock.
 * For this reason this wrapper function always works with inst->task.
 * As a result, this function have to be be called only from inst->task.
 *
 * Recursive locking is allowed. Auxiliary variable pointed to by "statep"
 * stores information if last run_exclusive_enter() operation really locked
 * something or if the lock was called recursively and was no-op.
 *
 * The pair (inst, state) used for run_exclusive_enter() has to be
 * used for run_exclusive_exit().
 *
 * @param[in]  	  inst   The instance with the only task which is allowed to
 * run.
 * @param[in,out] statep Lock state: ISC_R_SUCCESS or ISC_R_LOCKBUSY
