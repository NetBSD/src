rem for IPv4 adding these static addresses to a physical interface
rem will switch it from DHCP to static flushing DHCP setup.
rem So it is highly recommended to install the loopback pseudo-interface
rem and add IPv4 addresses to it.

rem for IPv6 your interface can have a different name, e.g.,
rem "Local Area Connection". Please update this script and remove the
rem exit line
