These tests check RPZ recursion behavior (including skipping
recursion when appropriate).

The general structure of the tests is:

* The resolver (ns2) with an unqualified view containing the policy
  zones, the response-policy statement, and a root hint zone

* The auth server that contains two authoritative zones, l1.l0 and
  l2.l1.l0, both delegated to itself. l2.l1.l0 specifies a non-existent
  zone data file and so will generate SERVFAILs for any queries to it.

The l2.l1.l0 zone was chosen to generate SERVFAIL responses because RPZ
evaluation will use that error response whenever it encounters it during
processing, thus making it a binary indicator for whether or not
recursion was attempted.  This also allows us to not worry about having
to craft 'ip', 'nsdname', and 'nsip' rules that matched the queries.

Each test is intended to be fed a number of queries constructed as
qXX.l2.l1.l0, where XX is the 1-based query sequence number (e.g. the
first query of each test is q01.l2.l1.l0).

For all the tests the triggers are constructed as follows:
client-ip - match 127.0.0.1/32
ip - match 255.255.255.255/32 (does not matter due to SERVFAIL)
nsdname - match ns.example.org (also does not matter)
nsip - match 255.255.255.255/32 (also does not matter)
qname - match qXX.l2.l1.l0, where XX is the query sequence number that
is intended to be matched by this qname rule.

Here's the detail on the test cases:

Group 1 - testing skipping recursion for a single policy zone with only
records that allow recursion to be skipped

Test 1a:
    1 policy zone containing 1 'client-ip' trigger
    1 query, expected to skip recursion

Test 1b:
    1 policy zone containing 1 'qname' trigger (q01)
    2 queries, q01 is expected to skip recursion, q02 is expected to
      recurse

Test 1c:
    1 policy zone containing both a 'client-ip' and 'qname' trigger (q02)
    1 query, expected to skip recursion

Group 2 - testing skipping recursion with multiple policy zones when all
zones have only trigger types eligible to skip recursion with

Test 2a:
    32 policy zones, each containing 1 'qname' trigger (qNN, where NN is
       the zone's sequence 1-based sequence number formatted to 2 digits,
       so each of the first 32 queries should match a different zone)
    33 queries, the first 32 of which are expected to skip recursion
       while the 33rd is expected to recurse

Group 3 - Testing interaction of triggers that require recursion when in
a single zone, both alone and with triggers that allow recursion to be
skipped

Test 3a:
    1 policy zone containing 1 'ip' trigger
    1 query, expected to recurse

Test 3b:
    1 policy zone containing 1 'nsdname' trigger
    1 query, expected to recurse

Test 3c:
    1 policy zone containing 1 'nsip' trigger
    1 query, expected to recurse

Test 3d:
    1 policy zone containing 1 'ip' trigger and 1 'qname' trigger (q02)
    2 queries, the first should not recurse and the second should recurse

Test 3e:
    1 policy zone containing 1 'nsdname' trigger and 1 'qname' trigger
      (q02)
    2 queries, the first should not recurse and the second should recurse

Test 3f:
    1 policy zone containing 1 'nsip' trigger and 1 'qname' trigger (q02)
    2 queries, the first should not recurse and the second should recurse

Group 4 - contains 32 subtests designed to verify that recursion is
skippable for only the appropriate zones based on the order specified in
the 'response-policy' statement

Tests 4aa to 4bf:
    32 policy zones per test, one of which is configured with 1 'ip'
       trigger and one 'qname' trigger while the others are configured
       only with 1 'qname' trigger.  The zone with both triggers starts
       listed first and is moved backwards by one position with each
       test.  The 'qname' triggers in the zones are structured so that
       the zones are tested starting with the first zone and the 'ip'
       trigger is tested before the 'qname' trigger for that zone.
    33 queries per test, where the number expected to skip recursion
       matches the test sequence number: e.g. 1 skip for 4aa, 26 skips
       for 4az, and 32 skips for 4bf

Group 5 - This test verifies that the "pivot" policy zone for whether or
not recursion can be skipped is the first listed zone with applicable
trigger types rather than a later listed zone.

Test 5a:
    5 policy zones, the 1st, 3rd, and 5th configured with 1 'qname'
      trigger each (q01, q04, and q06, respectively), the 2nd and 4th
      each configured with an 'ip' and 'qname' trigger (q02 and q05,
      respectively for the 'qname' triggers
    6 queries, of which only q01 and q02 are expected to skip recursion
