 * NS7
 *
 * NOTE: This named instance is used to reproduce a scenario which involves a
 * number of functions getting called in a very specific order which results in
 * an infinite loop while iterating over NSEC3 red-black tree.  Ensuring this
 * happens requires carefully setting the number of signing keys, NSEC3
 * parameters (number of iterations and salt value), zone data and named
 * configuration.  Changing any of these and/or influencing this instance's
 * behavior (e.g. by sending extra queries to it) might render this test moot
 * as it will no longer be able to reproduce the exact scenario it attempts to.
 *
 * Given the above, please do not use this instance for any other test than the
 * one it was meant for.
