# The awk script below achieves two goals:
#
# - it puts one of the two RRSIG(SOA) records at the end of the zone file, so
#   that these two records (forming a single RRset) are not placed immediately
#   next to each other; the test then checks if RRSIG RRsets split this way are
#   correctly added to resigning heaps,
#
# - it places a copy of one of the RRSIG(SOA) records somewhere else than at the
#   zone apex; the test then checks whether such signatures are automatically
#   removed from the zone after it is loaded.
