These scripts generate a named.conf file with an arbitrary number of
small zones, for testing startup performance.

To generate a test server with 1000 zones each of which contains 5 A
records, run:

   $ sh setup.sh 1000 5 > named.conf

Zones are generated with random names, and the zone files are created
in the subdirectory "zones".

Or, to generate a test server with 100 zones which all load from the same
generic file (smallzone.db):

   $ sh setup.sh -s 100 > named.conf

The "number of records" argument is ignored if -s is used.
