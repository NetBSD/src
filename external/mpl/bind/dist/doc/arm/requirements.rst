BIND Resource Requirements
==========================

.. _hw_req:

Hardware Requirements
---------------------

DNS hardware requirements have traditionally been quite modest. For many
installations, servers that have been retired from active duty
have performed admirably as DNS servers.

However, the DNSSEC features of BIND 9 may be quite CPU-intensive,
so organizations that make heavy use of these features may wish
to consider larger systems for these applications. BIND 9 is fully
multithreaded, allowing full utilization of multiprocessor systems for
installations that need it.

.. _cpu_req:

CPU Requirements
----------------

CPU requirements for BIND 9 range from i386-class machines, for serving
static zones without caching, to enterprise-class machines
to process many dynamic updates and DNSSEC-signed zones, serving
many thousands of queries per second.

.. _mem_req:

Memory Requirements
-------------------

Server memory must be sufficient to hold both the cache and the
zones loaded from disk. The ``max-cache-size`` option can
limit the amount of memory used by the cache, at the expense of reducing
cache hit rates and causing more DNS traffic. It is still good practice
to have enough memory to load all zone and cache data into memory;
unfortunately, the best way to determine this for a given installation
is to watch the name server in operation. After a few weeks, the server
process should reach a relatively stable size where entries are expiring
from the cache as fast as they are being inserted.

.. _intensive_env:

Name Server-Intensive Environment Issues
----------------------------------------

For name server-intensive environments, there are two
configurations that may be used. The first is one where clients and any
second-level internal name servers query the main name server, which has
enough memory to build a large cache; this approach minimizes the
bandwidth used by external name lookups. The second alternative is to
set up second-level internal name servers to make queries independently.
In this configuration, none of the individual machines need to have as
much memory or CPU power as in the first alternative, but this has the
disadvantage of making many more external queries, as none of the name
servers share their cached data.
