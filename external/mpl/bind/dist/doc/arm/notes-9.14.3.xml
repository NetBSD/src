          When <command>qname-minimization</command> was set to
          <command>relaxed</command>, some improperly configured domains
          would fail to resolve, but would have succeeded when minimization
          was disabled. <command>named</command> will now fall back to normal
          resolution in such cases, and also uses type A rather than NS for
          minimal queries in order to reduce the likelihood of encountering
          the problem. [GL #1055]
