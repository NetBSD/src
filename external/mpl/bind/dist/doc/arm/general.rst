Requests for Comment (RFCs)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Specification documents for the Internet protocol suite, including the
DNS, are published as part of the `Request for Comments`_ (RFCs) series
of technical notes. The standards themselves are defined by the
`Internet Engineering Task Force`_ (IETF) and the `Internet Engineering
Steering Group`_ (IESG). RFCs can be viewed online at:
https://www.rfc-editor.org/.

While reading RFCs, please keep in mind that :rfc:`not all RFCs are
standards <1796>`, and also that the validity of documents does change
over time. Every RFC needs to be interpreted in the context of other
documents.

BIND 9 strives for strict compliance with IETF standards. To the best
of our knowledge, BIND 9 complies with the following RFCs, with
the caveats and exceptions listed in the numbered notes below. Many
of these RFCs were written by current or former ISC staff members.
The list is non-exhaustive.

Some of these RFCs, though DNS-related, are not concerned with implementing
software.

Notes
~~~~~

.. [#rfc1035_1] Queries to zones that have failed to load return SERVFAIL rather
   than a non-authoritative response. This is considered a feature.

.. [#rfc1035_2] CLASS ANY queries are not supported. This is considered a
   feature.

.. [#rfc2931] When receiving a query signed with a SIG(0), the server is
   only able to verify the signature if it has the key in its local
   authoritative data; it cannot do recursion or validation to
   retrieve unknown keys.

.. [#rfc2874] Compliance is with loading and serving of A6 records only.
   A6 records were moved to the experimental category by :rfc:`3363`.

.. [#rfc4431] Compliance is with loading and serving of DLV records only.
   DLV records were moved to the historic category by :rfc:`8749`.

.. [#rfc4470] Minimally Covering NSEC records are accepted but not generated.

.. [#rfc4955] BIND 9 interoperates with correctly designed experiments.

.. [#rfc5452] ``named`` only uses ports to extend the ID space; addresses are not
   used.

.. [#rfc6147] Section 5.5 does not match reality. ``named`` uses the presence
   of DO=1 to detect if validation may be occurring. CD has no bearing
   on whether validation occurs.

.. [#rfc6605] Compliance is conditional on the OpenSSL library being linked against
   a supporting ECDSA.

.. [#rfc6725] RSAMD5 support has been removed. See :rfc:`8624`.

.. [#rfc6840] Section 5.9 - Always set CD=1 on queries. This is *not* done, as
   it prevents DNSSEC from working correctly through another recursive server.

   When talking to a recursive server, the best algorithm is to send
   CD=0 and then send CD=1 iff SERVFAIL is returned, in case the recursive
   server has a bad clock and/or bad trust anchor. Alternatively, one
   can send CD=1 then CD=0 on validation failure, in case the recursive
   server is under attack or there is stale/bogus authoritative data.

.. [#rfc7344] Updating of parent zones is not yet implemented.

.. [#rfc7830] ``named`` does not currently encrypt DNS requests, so the PAD option
   is accepted but not returned in responses.

.. [#rfc3363] Section 4 is ignored.

.. [#rfc2606] This does not apply to DNS server implementations.

.. [#rfc1521] Only the Base 64 encoding specification is supported.

.. [#idna] BIND 9 requires ``--with-libidn2`` to enable entry of IDN labels within
   dig, host, and nslookup at compile time.  ACE labels are supported
   everywhere with or without ``--with-libidn2``.

.. [#rfc4294] Section 5.1 - DNAME records are fully supported.

.. [#rfc8078] Updating of parent zones is not yet implemented.

Internet Drafts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Internet Drafts (IDs) are rough-draft working documents of the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF). They are, in essence, RFCs in the preliminary
stages of development. Implementors are cautioned not to regard IDs as
archival, and they should not be quoted or cited in any formal documents
unless accompanied by the disclaimer that they are "works in progress."
IDs have a lifespan of six months, after which they are deleted unless
updated by their authors.
