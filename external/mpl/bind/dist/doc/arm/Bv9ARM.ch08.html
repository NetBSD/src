    <p>
      BIND 9.13 is an unstable development release of BIND.
      This document summarizes new features and functional changes that
      have been introduced on this branch.  With each development release
      leading up to the stable BIND 9.14 release, this document will be
      updated with additional features added and bugs fixed.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="relnotes_versions"></a>Note on Version Numbering</h3></div></div></div>
    <p>
      Prior to BIND 9.13, new feature development releases were tagged
      as "alpha" and "beta", leading up to the first stable release
      for a given development branch, which always ended in ".0".
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, however, BIND has adopted the "odd-unstable/even-stable"
      release numbering convention. There will be no "alpha" or "beta"
      releases in the 9.13 branch, only increasing version numbers.
      So, for example, what would previously have been called 9.13.0a1,
      9.13.0a2, 9.13.0b1, and so on, will instead be called 9.13.0,
      9.13.1, 9.13.2, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first stable release from this development branch will be
      renamed as 9.14.0. Thereafter, maintenance releases will continue
      on the 9.14 branch, while unstable feature development proceeds in
      9.15.
    </p>
  </div>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="relnotes_platforms"></a>Supported Platforms</h3></div></div></div>
    <p>
      BIND 9.13 has undergone substantial code refactoring and cleanup,
      and some very old code has been removed that was needed to support
      legacy platforms which are no longer supported by their vendors
      and for which ISC is no longer able to perform quality assurance
      testing.  Specifically, workarounds for old versions of UnixWare,
      BSD/OS, AIX, Tru64, SunOS, TruCluster and IRIX have been removed.
      On UNIX-like systems, BIND now requires support for POSIX.1c
      threads (IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995), the Advanced Sockets API for
      IPv6 (RFC 3542), and standard atomic operations provided by the
      C compiler.
    </p>
    <p>
      More information can be found in the <code class="filename">PLATFORM.md</code>
      file that is included in the source distribution of BIND 9.  If your
      platform compiler and system libraries provide the above features,
      BIND 9 should compile and run. If that isn't the case, the BIND
      development team will generally accept patches that add support
      for systems that are still supported by their respective vendors.
    </p>
    <p>
      As of BIND 9.13, the BIND development team has also made cryptography
      (i.e., TSIG and DNSSEC) an integral part of the DNS server.  The
      OpenSSL cryptography library must be available for the target
      platform.  A PKCS#11 provider can be used instead for Public Key
      cryptography (i.e., DNSSEC signing and validation), but OpenSSL is
      still required for general cryptography operations such as hashing
      and random number generation.

	<p>
	  Workarounds for servers that misbehave when queried with EDNS
	  have been removed, because these broken servers and the
	  workarounds for their noncompliance cause unnecessary delays,
	  increase code complexity, and prevent deployment of new DNS
	  features. See <a class="link" href="https://dnsflagday.net" target="_top">https://dnsflagday.net</a>
	  for further details.
	</p>
	<p>
	  In particular, resolution will no longer fall back to
	  plain DNS when there was no response from an authoritative
	  server.  This will cause some domains to become non-resolvable
	  without manual intervention.  In these cases, resolution can
	  be restored by adding <span class="command"><strong>server</strong></span> clauses for the
	  offending servers, specifying <span class="command"><strong>edns no</strong></span> or
	  <span class="command"><strong>send-cookie no</strong></span>, depending on the specific
	  noncompliance.
	</p>
	<p>
	  To determine which <span class="command"><strong>server</strong></span> clause to use, run
	  the following commands to send queries to the authoritative
	  servers for the broken domain:
	</p>
<div class="literallayout"><p><br>
	  dig soa &lt;zone&gt; @&lt;server&gt; +dnssec<br>

	  dig soa &lt;zone&gt; @&lt;server&gt; +noedns<br>
</p></div>
	<p>
	  If the first command fails but the second succeeds, the
	  server most likely needs <span class="command"><strong>send-cookie no</strong></span>.
	  If the first two fail but the third succeeds, then the server
	  needs EDNS to be fully disabled with <span class="command"><strong>edns no</strong></span>.

	  with other servers that do not yet support DNS COOKIE.  A mismatch
	  between servers on the same address is not expected to cause
	  operational problems, but the option to disable COOKIE responses so
	  that all servers have the same behavior is provided out of an
	  abundance of caution. DNS COOKIE is an important security mechanism,
	  and should not be disabled unless absolutely necessary.

	<p>
	  Remove support for silently ignoring 'no-change' deltas from
	  BIND 8 when processing an IXFR stream.  'no-change' deltas
	  will now trigger a fallback to AXFR as the recovery mechanism.
	</p>
	<p>
	  BIND 9 will no longer build on platforms that doesn't have
	  proper IPv6 support.  BIND 9 now also requires non-broken
	  POSIX-compatible pthread support.  Such platforms are
	  usually long after their end-of-life date and they are
	  neither developed nor supported by their respective vendors.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Support for DSA and DSA-NSEC3-SHA1 algorithms has been
	  removed from BIND as the DSA key length is limited to 1024
	  bits and this is not considered secure enough.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Support for RSAMD5 algorithm has been removed freom BIND as the usage
	  of the RSAMD5 algorithm for DNSSEC has been deprecated in RFC6725 and
	  the security of MD5 algorithm has been compromised and the its usage
	  is considered harmful.

<li class="listitem">
	<p>
	  The incomplete support for internationalization message catalogs has
	  been removed from BIND. Since the internationalization was never
	  completed, and no localized message catalogs were ever made available
	  for the portions of BIND in which they could have been used, this
	  change will have no effect except to simplify the source code. BIND's
	  log messages and other output were already only available in English.

      BIND 9.13 is an unstable development branch. When its development
      is complete, it will be renamed to BIND 9.14, which will be a
      stable branch.

      The end of life date for BIND 9.14 has not yet been determined.
      For those needing long term support, the current Extended Support
      Version (ESV) is BIND 9.11, which will be supported until at
