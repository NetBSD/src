  <p>
    BIND 9.14 is a stable branch of BIND.
    This document summarizes significant changes since the last
    production release on that branch.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please see the file <code class="filename">CHANGES</code> for a more
    detailed list of changes and bug fixes.

<a name="relnotes_versions"></a>Note on Version Numbering</h3></div></div></div>
  <p>
    As of BIND 9.13/9.14, BIND has adopted the "odd-unstable/even-stable"
    release numbering convention.  BIND 9.14 contains new features added
    during the BIND 9.13 development process. Henceforth, the 9.14 branch
    will be limited to bug fixes and new feature development will proceed
    in the unstable 9.15 branch, and so forth.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="relnotes_platforms"></a>Supported Platforms</h3></div></div></div>
  <p>
    Since 9.12, BIND has undergone substantial code refactoring and
    cleanup, and some very old code has been removed that supported
    obsolete operating systems and operating systems for which ISC is
    no longer able to perform quality assurance testing. Specifically,
    workarounds for UnixWare, BSD/OS, AIX, Tru64, SunOS, TruCluster
    and IRIX have been removed.
  </p>
  <p>
    On UNIX-like systems, BIND now requires support for POSIX.1c
    threads (IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995), the Advanced Sockets API for
    IPv6 (RFC 3542), and standard atomic operations provided by the
    C compiler.
  </p>
  <p>
    More information can be found in the <code class="filename">PLATFORM.md</code>
    file that is included in the source distribution of BIND 9.  If your
    platform compiler and system libraries provide the above features,
    BIND 9 should compile and run. If that isn't the case, the BIND
    development team will generally accept patches that add support
    for systems that are still supported by their respective vendors.
  </p>
  <p>
    As of BIND 9.14, the BIND development team has also made cryptography
    (i.e., TSIG and DNSSEC) an integral part of the DNS server.  The
    OpenSSL cryptography library must be available for the target
    platform.  A PKCS#11 provider can be used instead for Public Key
    cryptography (i.e., DNSSEC signing and validation), but OpenSSL is
    still required for general cryptography operations such as hashing
    and random number generation.

        The new GeoIP2 API from MaxMind is now supported when BIND
        is compiled using <span class="command"><strong>configure --with-geoip2</strong></span>.
        The legacy GeoIP API can be used by compiling with
        <span class="command"><strong>configure --with-geoip</strong></span> instead.  (Note that
        the databases for the legacy API are no longer maintained by
        MaxMind.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The default path to the GeoIP2 databases will be set based
        on the location of the <span class="command"><strong>libmaxminddb</strong></span> library;
        for example, if it is in <code class="filename">/usr/local/lib</code>,
        then the default path will be
        <code class="filename">/usr/local/share/GeoIP</code>.
        This value can be overridden in <code class="filename">named.conf</code>
        using the <span class="command"><strong>geoip-directory</strong></span> option.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some <span class="command"><strong>geoip</strong></span> ACL settings that were available with
        legacy GeoIP, including searches for <span class="command"><strong>netspeed</strong></span>,
        <span class="command"><strong>org</strong></span>, and three-letter ISO country codes, will
        no longer work when using GeoIP2. Supported GeoIP2 database
        types are <span class="command"><strong>country</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>city</strong></span>,
        <span class="command"><strong>domain</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>isp</strong></span>, and

        Two new metrics have been added to the

        signing operations.  For each key in each zone, the
        <span class="command"><strong>dnssec-sign</strong></span> counter indicates the total
        number of signatures <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span> has generated
        using that key since server startup, and the
        <span class="command"><strong>dnssec-refresh</strong></span> counter indicates how
        many of those signatures were refreshed during zone
        maintenance, as opposed to having been generated
        as a result of a zone update.  [GL #513]

        If you are running multiple DNS Servers (different versions of BIND 9
        or DNS server from multiple vendors) responding from the same IP
        address (anycast or load-balancing scenarios), you'll have to make
        sure that all the servers are configured with the same DNS Cookie
