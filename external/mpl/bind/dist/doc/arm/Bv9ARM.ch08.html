    <p>
      BIND 9.13 is an unstable development release of BIND.
      This document summarizes new features and functional changes that
      have been introduced on this branch.  With each development release
      leading up to the stable BIND 9.14 release, this document will be
      updated with additional features added and bugs fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      BIND 9.13.5-W1 is a minimal patch release, addressing a build error
      on Windows systems that caused some files to be omitted from the ZIP
      files originally published for BIND 9.13.5. There is no need to use
      BIND 9.13.5-W1 on any operating system other than Windows.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="relnotes_versions"></a>Note on Version Numbering</h3></div></div></div>
    <p>
      Prior to BIND 9.13, new feature development releases were tagged
      as "alpha" and "beta", leading up to the first stable release
      for a given development branch, which always ended in ".0".
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, however, BIND has adopted the "odd-unstable/even-stable"
      release numbering convention. There will be no "alpha" or "beta"
      releases in the 9.13 branch, only increasing version numbers.
      So, for example, what would previously have been called 9.13.0a1,
      9.13.0a2, 9.13.0b1, and so on, will instead be called 9.13.0,
      9.13.1, 9.13.2, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first stable release from this development branch will be
      renamed as 9.14.0. Thereafter, maintenance releases will continue
      on the 9.14 branch, while unstable feature development proceeds in
      9.15.
    </p>
  </div>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="relnotes_platforms"></a>Supported Platforms</h3></div></div></div>
    <p>
      BIND 9.13 has undergone substantial code refactoring and cleanup,
      and some very old code has been removed that was needed to support
      legacy platforms which are no longer supported by their vendors
      and for which ISC is no longer able to perform quality assurance
      testing.  Specifically, workarounds for old versions of UnixWare,
      BSD/OS, AIX, Tru64, SunOS, TruCluster and IRIX have been removed.
      On UNIX-like systems, BIND now requires support for POSIX.1c
      threads (IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995), the Advanced Sockets API for
      IPv6 (RFC 3542), and standard atomic operations provided by the
      C compiler.
    </p>
    <p>
      More information can be found in the <code class="filename">PLATFORM.md</code>
      file that is included in the source distribution of BIND 9.  If your
      platform compiler and system libraries provide the above features,
      BIND 9 should compile and run. If that isn't the case, the BIND
      development team will generally accept patches that add support
      for systems that are still supported by their respective vendors.
    </p>
    <p>
      As of BIND 9.13, the BIND development team has also made cryptography
      (i.e., TSIG and DNSSEC) an integral part of the DNS server.  The
      OpenSSL cryptography library must be available for the target
      platform.  A PKCS#11 provider can be used instead for Public Key
      cryptography (i.e., DNSSEC signing and validation), but OpenSSL is
      still required for general cryptography operations such as hashing
      and random number generation.

	  Task manager and socket code have been substantially modified.

	  multi-queue NICs.

	  enables <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span> to serve a transferred copy
	  of a zone's contents without acting as an authority for the
	  zone. A zone must be fully validated against an active trust
	  anchor before it can be used as a mirror zone. DNS responses
	  from mirror zones do not set the AA bit ("authoritative answer"),
	  but do set the AD bit ("authenticated data"). This feature is
	  meant to facilitate deployment of a local copy of the root zone,

	  Support for QNAME minimization was added and enabled by default

	  The new configure option <span class="command"><strong>--enable-fips-mode</strong></span>
	  can be used to make BIND enable and enforce FIPS mode in the

<li class="listitem">
	<p>
	  Workarounds for servers that misbehave when queried with EDNS
	  have been removed, because these broken servers and the
	  workarounds for their noncompliance cause unnecessary delays,
	  increase code complexity, and prevent deployment of new DNS
	  features. See <a class="link" href="https://dnsflagday.net" target="_top">https://dnsflagday.net</a>
	  for further details.
	</p>
	<p>
	  In particular, resolution will no longer fall back to
	  plain DNS when there was no response from an authoritative
	  server.  This will cause some domains to become non-resolvable
	  without manual intervention.  In these cases, resolution can
	  be restored by adding <span class="command"><strong>server</strong></span> clauses for the
	  offending servers, specifying <span class="command"><strong>edns no</strong></span> or
	  <span class="command"><strong>send-cookie no</strong></span>, depending on the specific
	  noncompliance.
	</p>
	<p>
	  To determine which <span class="command"><strong>server</strong></span> clause to use, run
	  the following commands to send queries to the authoritative
	  servers for the broken domain:
	</p>
<div class="literallayout"><p><br>
	  dig soa &lt;zone&gt; @&lt;server&gt; +dnssec<br>
	  dig soa &lt;zone&gt; @&lt;server&gt; +dnssec +nocookie<br>
	  dig soa &lt;zone&gt; @&lt;server&gt; +noedns<br>
</p></div>
	<p>
	  If the first command fails but the second succeeds, the
	  server most likely needs <span class="command"><strong>send-cookie no</strong></span>.
	  If the first two fail but the third succeeds, then the server
	  needs EDNS to be fully disabled with <span class="command"><strong>edns no</strong></span>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Please contact the administrators of noncompliant domains
	  and encourage them to upgrade their broken DNS servers. [GL #150]

	  Previously, it was possible to build BIND without thread support

	  BIND will now always use the best CSPRNG (cryptographically-secure
	  pseudo-random number generator) available on the platform where
	  it is compiled.  It will use <span class="command"><strong>arc4random()</strong></span>
	  family of functions on BSD operating systems,
	  <span class="command"><strong>getrandom()</strong></span> on Linux and Solaris,
	  <span class="command"><strong>CryptGenRandom</strong></span> on Windows, and the selected
	  cryptography provider library (OpenSSL or PKCS#11) as the last
	  resort. [GL #221]

<li class="listitem">
	<p>
	  The default setting for <span class="command"><strong>dnssec-validation</strong></span> is
	  now <strong class="userinput"><code>auto</code></strong>, which activates DNSSEC
	  validation using the IANA root key. (The default can be changed
	  back to <strong class="userinput"><code>yes</code></strong>, which activates DNSSEC
	  validation only when keys are explicitly configured in
	  <code class="filename">named.conf</code>, by building BIND with
	  <span class="command"><strong>configure --disable-auto-validation</strong></span>.) [GL #30]

<li class="listitem">
	<p>
	  BIND can no longer be built without DNSSEC support. A cryptography

	  when the standard output is not a TTY (i.e., when the output
	  is not being read by a human). When running from a shell
	  script, the command line options <span class="command"><strong>+idnin</strong></span> and

	  processing of input and output domain names, respectively.
	  When running on a TTY, the <span class="command"><strong>+noidnin</strong></span> and

      BIND 9.13 is an unstable development branch. When its development
      is complete, it will be renamed to BIND 9.14, which will be a
      stable branch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end of life date for BIND 9.14 has not yet been determined.
      For those needing long term support, the current Extended Support
      Version (ESV) is BIND 9.11, which will be supported until at
      least December 2021. See
