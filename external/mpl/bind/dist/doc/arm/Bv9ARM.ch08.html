    BIND 9.14 is a stable branch of BIND.
    This document summarizes significant changes since the last
    production release on that branch.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please see the file <code class="filename">CHANGES</code> for a more
    detailed list of changes and bug fixes.
  </p>

<a name="relnotes_versions"></a>Note on Version Numbering</h3></div></div></div>
  <p>
    As of BIND 9.13/9.14, BIND has adopted the "odd-unstable/even-stable"
    release numbering convention.  BIND 9.14 contains new features added
    during the BIND 9.13 development process. Henceforth, the 9.14 branch
    will be limited to bug fixes and new feature development will proceed
    in the unstable 9.15 branch, and so forth.
  </p>
</div>
  <div class="section">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="relnotes_platforms"></a>Supported Platforms</h3></div></div></div>
  <p>
    Since 9.12, BIND has undergone substantial code refactoring and
    cleanup, and some very old code has been removed that supported
    obsolete operating systems and operating systems for which ISC is
    no longer able to perform quality assurance testing. Specifically,
    workarounds for UnixWare, BSD/OS, AIX, Tru64, SunOS, TruCluster
    and IRIX have been removed.
  </p>
  <p>
    On UNIX-like systems, BIND now requires support for POSIX.1c
    threads (IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995), the Advanced Sockets API for
    IPv6 (RFC 3542), and standard atomic operations provided by the
    C compiler.
  </p>
  <p>
    More information can be found in the <code class="filename">PLATFORM.md</code>
    file that is included in the source distribution of BIND 9.  If your
    platform compiler and system libraries provide the above features,
    BIND 9 should compile and run. If that isn't the case, the BIND
    development team will generally accept patches that add support
    for systems that are still supported by their respective vendors.
  </p>
  <p>
    As of BIND 9.14, the BIND development team has also made cryptography
    (i.e., TSIG and DNSSEC) an integral part of the DNS server.  The
    OpenSSL cryptography library must be available for the target
    platform.  A PKCS#11 provider can be used instead for Public Key
    cryptography (i.e., DNSSEC signing and validation), but OpenSSL is
    still required for general cryptography operations such as hashing
    and random number generation.

          Workarounds for servers that misbehave when queried with EDNS
          have been removed, because these broken servers and the
          workarounds for their noncompliance cause unnecessary delays,
          increase code complexity, and prevent deployment of new DNS
          features. See <a class="link" href="https://dnsflagday.net" target="_top">https://dnsflagday.net</a>

          In particular, resolution will no longer fall back to
          plain DNS when there was no response from an authoritative
          server.  This will cause some domains to become non-resolvable
          without manual intervention.  In these cases, resolution can
          be restored by adding <span class="command"><strong>server</strong></span> clauses for the
          offending servers, specifying <span class="command"><strong>edns no</strong></span> or
          <span class="command"><strong>send-cookie no</strong></span>, depending on the specific
          noncompliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          To determine which <span class="command"><strong>server</strong></span> clause to use, run
          the following commands to send queries to the authoritative
          servers for the broken domain:
        </p>
<div class="literallayout"><p><br>
          dig soa &lt;zone&gt; @&lt;server&gt; +dnssec<br>
          dig soa &lt;zone&gt; @&lt;server&gt; +dnssec +nocookie<br>
          dig soa &lt;zone&gt; @&lt;server&gt; +noedns<br>
</p></div>
        <p>
          If the first command fails but the second succeeds, the
          server most likely needs <span class="command"><strong>send-cookie no</strong></span>.
          If the first two fail but the third succeeds, then the server
          needs EDNS to be fully disabled with <span class="command"><strong>edns no</strong></span>.
