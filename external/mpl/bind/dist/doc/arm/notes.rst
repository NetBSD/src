Introduction
------------

BIND 9.16 (Extended Support Version) is a stable branch of BIND. This
document summarizes significant changes since the last production
release on that branch. Please see the CHANGES file for a more detailed
list of changes and bug fixes.

Note on Version Numbering
-------------------------

As of BIND 9.13/9.14, BIND has adopted the "odd-unstable/even-stable"
release numbering convention. BIND 9.16 contains new features that were
added during the BIND 9.15 development process. Henceforth, the 9.16
branch will be limited to bug fixes, and new feature development will
proceed in the unstable 9.17 branch.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

See the :ref:`supported_os` section in the :ref:`Requirements` chapter.
