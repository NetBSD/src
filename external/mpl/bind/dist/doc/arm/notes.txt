Release Notes for BIND Version 9.14.7

Introduction

BIND 9.14 is a stable branch of BIND. This document summarizes significant
changes since the last production release on that branch.

Please see the file CHANGES for a more detailed list of changes and bug
fixes.

Note on Version Numbering

As of BIND 9.13/9.14, BIND has adopted the "odd-unstable/even-stable"
release numbering convention. BIND 9.14 contains new features added during
the BIND 9.13 development process. Henceforth, the 9.14 branch will be
limited to bug fixes and new feature development will proceed in the
unstable 9.15 branch, and so forth.

Supported Platforms

Since 9.12, BIND has undergone substantial code refactoring and cleanup,
and some very old code has been removed that supported obsolete operating
systems and operating systems for which ISC is no longer able to perform
quality assurance testing. Specifically, workarounds for UnixWare, BSD/OS,
AIX, Tru64, SunOS, TruCluster and IRIX have been removed.

On UNIX-like systems, BIND now requires support for POSIX.1c threads (IEEE
Std 1003.1c-1995), the Advanced Sockets API for IPv6 (RFC 3542), and
standard atomic operations provided by the C compiler.

More information can be found in the PLATFORM.md file that is included in
the source distribution of BIND 9. If your platform compiler and system
libraries provide the above features, BIND 9 should compile and run. If
that isn't the case, the BIND development team will generally accept
patches that add support for systems that are still supported by their
respective vendors.

As of BIND 9.14, the BIND development team has also made cryptography
(i.e., TSIG and DNSSEC) an integral part of the DNS server. The OpenSSL
cryptography library must be available for the target platform. A PKCS#11
provider can be used instead for Public Key cryptography (i.e., DNSSEC
signing and validation), but OpenSSL is still required for general
cryptography operations such as hashing and random number generation.

Download

The latest versions of BIND 9 software can always be found at http://
www.isc.org/downloads/. There you will find additional information about
each release, source code, and pre-compiled versions for Microsoft Windows
operating systems.

Security Fixes

  * A race condition could trigger an assertion failure when a large
    number of incoming packets were being rejected. This flaw is disclosed
    in CVE-2019-6471. [GL #942]

  * named could crash with an assertion failure if a forwarder returned a
    referral, rather than resolving the query, when QNAME minimization was
    enabled. This flaw is disclosed in CVE-2019-6476. [GL #1501]

  * A flaw in DNSSEC verification when transferring mirror zones could
    allow data to be incorrectly marked valid. This flaw is disclosed in
    CVE-2019-6475. [GL #16P]

New Features

  * The new GeoIP2 API from MaxMind is now supported when BIND is compiled
    using configure --with-geoip2. The legacy GeoIP API can be used by
    compiling with configure --with-geoip instead. (Note that the
    databases for the legacy API are no longer maintained by MaxMind.)

    The default path to the GeoIP2 databases will be set based on the
    location of the libmaxminddb library; for example, if it is in /usr/
    local/lib, then the default path will be /usr/local/share/GeoIP. This
    value can be overridden in named.conf using the geoip-directory
    option.

    Some geoip ACL settings that were available with legacy GeoIP,
    including searches for netspeed, org, and three-letter ISO country
    codes, will no longer work when using GeoIP2. Supported GeoIP2
    database types are country, city, domain, isp, and as. All of the
    databases support both IPv4 and IPv6 lookups. [GL #182]

  * Two new metrics have been added to the statistics-channel to report
    DNSSEC signing operations. For each key in each zone, the dnssec-sign
    counter indicates the total number of signatures named has generated
    using that key since server startup, and the dnssec-refresh counter
    indicates how many of those signatures were refreshed during zone
    maintenance, as opposed to having been generated as a result of a zone
    update. [GL #513]

  * A SipHash 2-4 based DNS Cookie (RFC 7873) algorithm has been added.
    [GL #605]

    If you are running multiple DNS Servers (different versions of BIND 9
    or DNS server from multiple vendors) responding from the same IP
    address (anycast or load-balancing scenarios), you'll have to make
    sure that all the servers are configured with the same DNS Cookie
    algorithm and same Server Secret for the best performance.

  * DS records included in DNS referral messages can now be validated and
    cached immediately, reducing the number of queries needed for a DNSSEC
    validation. [GL #964]

Bug Fixes

  * When qname-minimization was set to relaxed, some improperly configured
    domains would fail to resolve, but would have succeeded when
    minimization was disabled. named will now fall back to normal
    resolution in such cases, and also uses type A rather than NS for
    minimal queries in order to reduce the likelihood of encountering the
    problem. [GL #1055]

  * Glue address records were not being returned in responses to root
    priming queries; this has been corrected. [GL #1092]

  * Interaction between DNS64 and RPZ No Data rule (CNAME *.) could cause
    unexpected results; this has been fixed. [GL #1106]

  * named-checkconf now checks DNS64 prefixes to ensure bits 64-71 are
    zero. [GL #1159]

  * named-checkconf could crash during configuration if configured to use
    "geoip continent" ACLs with legacy GeoIP. [GL #1163]

  * named-checkconf now correctly reports a missing dnstap-output option
    when dnstap is set. [GL #1136]

  * Handle ETIMEDOUT error on connect() with a non-blocking socket. [GL #
    1133]

  * Cache database statistics counters could report invalid values when
    stale answers were enabled, because of a bug in counter maintenance
    when cache data becomes stale. The statistics counters have been
    corrected to report the number of RRsets for each RR type that are
    active, stale but still potentially served, or stale and marked for
    deletion. [GL #602]

  * When a response-policy zone expires, ensure that its policies are
    removed from the RPZ summary database. [GL #1146]
