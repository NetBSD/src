          The new GeoIP2 API from MaxMind is now supported when BIND
          is compiled using <command>configure --with-geoip2</command>.
          The legacy GeoIP API can be used by compiling with
          <command>configure --with-geoip</command> instead.  (Note that
          the databases for the legacy API are no longer maintained by
          MaxMind.)
        </para>
        <para>
          The default path to the GeoIP2 databases will be set based
          on the location of the <command>libmaxminddb</command> library;
          for example, if it is in <filename>/usr/local/lib</filename>,
          then the default path will be
          <filename>/usr/local/share/GeoIP</filename>.
          This value can be overridden in <filename>named.conf</filename>
          using the <command>geoip-directory</command> option.
        </para>
        <para>
          Some <command>geoip</command> ACL settings that were available with
          legacy GeoIP, including searches for <command>netspeed</command>,
          <command>org</command>, and three-letter ISO country codes, will
          no longer work when using GeoIP2. Supported GeoIP2 database
          types are <command>country</command>, <command>city</command>,
          <command>domain</command>, <command>isp</command>, and
          <command>as</command>. All of the databases support both IPv4
          and IPv6 lookups. [GL #182]

        <para>
          Two new metrics have been added to the
          <command>statistics-channel</command> to report DNSSEC
          signing operations.  For each key in each zone, the
          <command>dnssec-sign</command> counter indicates the total
          number of signatures <command>named</command> has generated
          using that key since server startup, and the
          <command>dnssec-refresh</command> counter indicates how
          many of those signatures were refreshed during zone
          maintenance, as opposed to having been generated
          as a result of a zone update.  [GL #513]

          Glue address records were not being returned in responses
          to root priming queries; this has been corrected. [GL #1092]
