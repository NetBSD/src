        When <command>qname-minimization</command> was set to
        <command>relaxed</command>, some improperly configured domains
        would fail to resolve, but would have succeeded when minimization
        was disabled. <command>named</command> will now fall back to normal
        resolution in such cases, and also uses type A rather than NS for
        minimal queries in order to reduce the likelihood of encountering
        the problem. [GL #1055]

        Interaction between DNS64 and RPZ No Data rule (CNAME *.) could

        Cache database statistics counters could report invalid values
        when stale answers were enabled, because of a bug in counter
        maintenance when cache data becomes stale. The statistics counters
        have been corrected to report the number of RRsets for each
        RR type that are active, stale but still potentially served,
        or stale and marked for deletion. [GL #602]
