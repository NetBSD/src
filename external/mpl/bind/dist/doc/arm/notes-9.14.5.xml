          If you are running multiple DNS Servers (different versions of BIND 9
          or DNS server from multiple vendors) responding from the same IP
          address (anycast or load-balancing scenarios), you'll have to make
          sure that all the servers are configured with the same DNS Cookie
          algorithm and same Server Secret for the best performance.

          DS records included in DNS referral messages can now be validated
          and cached immediately, reducing the number of queries needed for
          a DNSSEC validation. [GL #964]

          Cache database statistics counters could report invalid values
          when stale answers were enabled, because of a bug in counter
          maintenance when cache data becomes stale. The statistics counters
          have been corrected to report the number of RRsets for each
          RR type that are active, stale but still potentially served,
          or stale and marked for deletion. [GL #602]
