      BIND 9.14 is a stable branch of BIND.
      This document summarizes significant changes since the last
      production release on that branch.
    </p>

<a name="relnotes_versions"></a>Note on Version Numbering</h3></div></div></div>
    <p>
      As of BIND 9.13/9.14, BIND has adopted the "odd-unstable/even-stable"
      release numbering convention.  BIND 9.14 contains new features added
      during the BIND 9.13 development process. Henceforth, the 9.14 branch
      will be limited to bug fixes and new feature development will proceed
      in the unstable 9.15 branch, and so forth.
    </p>

<a name="relnotes_platforms"></a>Supported Platforms</h3></div></div></div>
    <p>
      Since 9.12, BIND has undergone substantial code refactoring and
      cleanup, and some very old code has been removed that was needed
      to support legacy platforms which are no longer supported by their
      vendors and for which ISC is no longer able to perform quality
      assurance testing.  Specifically, workarounds for old versions of
      UnixWare, BSD/OS, AIX, Tru64, SunOS, TruCluster and IRIX have been
      removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On UNIX-like systems, BIND now requires support for POSIX.1c
      threads (IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995), the Advanced Sockets API for
      IPv6 (RFC 3542), and standard atomic operations provided by the
      C compiler.
    </p>
    <p>
      More information can be found in the <code class="filename">PLATFORM.md</code>
      file that is included in the source distribution of BIND 9.  If your
      platform compiler and system libraries provide the above features,
      BIND 9 should compile and run. If that isn't the case, the BIND
      development team will generally accept patches that add support
      for systems that are still supported by their respective vendors.
    </p>
    <p>
      As of BIND 9.14, the BIND development team has also made cryptography
      (i.e., TSIG and DNSSEC) an integral part of the DNS server.  The
      OpenSSL cryptography library must be available for the target
      platform.  A PKCS#11 provider can be used instead for Public Key
      cryptography (i.e., DNSSEC signing and validation), but OpenSSL is
      still required for general cryptography operations such as hashing
      and random number generation.
