      BIND 9.14 is a stable branch of BIND.
      This document summarizes significant changes since the last
      production release on that branch.

  <section xml:id="relnotes_versions"><info><title>Note on Version Numbering</title></info>
    <para>
      As of BIND 9.13/9.14, BIND has adopted the "odd-unstable/even-stable"
      release numbering convention.  BIND 9.14 contains new features added
      during the BIND 9.13 development process. Henceforth, the 9.14 branch
      will be limited to bug fixes and new feature development will proceed
      in the unstable 9.15 branch, and so forth.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="relnotes_platforms"><info><title>Supported Platforms</title></info>
    <para>
      Since 9.12, BIND has undergone substantial code refactoring and
      cleanup, and some very old code has been removed that supported
      obsolete operating systems and operating systems for which ISC is
      no longer able to perform quality assurance testing. Specifically,
      workarounds for UnixWare, BSD/OS, AIX, Tru64, SunOS, TruCluster
      and IRIX have been removed.
    </para>
    <para>
      On UNIX-like systems, BIND now requires support for POSIX.1c
      threads (IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995), the Advanced Sockets API for
      IPv6 (RFC 3542), and standard atomic operations provided by the
      C compiler.
    </para>
    <para>
      More information can be found in the <filename>PLATFORM.md</filename>
      file that is included in the source distribution of BIND 9.  If your
      platform compiler and system libraries provide the above features,
      BIND 9 should compile and run. If that isn't the case, the BIND
      development team will generally accept patches that add support
      for systems that are still supported by their respective vendors.
    </para>
    <para>
      As of BIND 9.14, the BIND development team has also made cryptography
      (i.e., TSIG and DNSSEC) an integral part of the DNS server.  The
      OpenSSL cryptography library must be available for the target
      platform.  A PKCS#11 provider can be used instead for Public Key
      cryptography (i.e., DNSSEC signing and validation), but OpenSSL is
      still required for general cryptography operations such as hashing
      and random number generation.

	<para>
	  The new GeoIP2 API from MaxMind is now supported when BIND
	  is compiled using <command>configure --with-geoip2</command>.
	  The legacy GeoIP API can be used by compiling with
	  <command>configure --with-geoip</command> instead.  (Note that
	  the databases for the legacy API are no longer maintained by
	  MaxMind.)
	</para>
	<para>
	  The default path to the GeoIP2 databases will be set based
	  on the location of the <command>libmaxminddb</command> library;
	  for example, if it is in <filename>/usr/local/lib</filename>,
	  then the default path will be
	  <filename>/usr/local/share/GeoIP</filename>.
	  This value can be overridden in <filename>named.conf</filename>
	  using the <command>geoip-directory</command> option.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Some <command>geoip</command> ACL settings that were available with
	  legacy GeoIP, including searches for <command>netspeed</command>,
	  <command>org</command>, and three-letter ISO country codes, will
	  no longer work when using GeoIP2. Supported GeoIP2 database
	  types are <command>country</command>, <command>city</command>,
	  <command>domain</command>, <command>isp</command>, and
	  <command>as</command>. All of the databases support both IPv4
	  and IPv6 lookups. [GL #182]
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Two new metrics have been added to the
	  <command>statistics-channel</command> to report DNSSEC
	  signing operations.  For each key in each zone, the
	  <command>dnssec-sign</command> counter indicates the total
	  number of signatures <command>named</command> has generated
	  using that key since server startup, and the
	  <command>dnssec-refresh</command> counter indicates how
	  many of those signatures were refreshed during zone
	  maintenance, as opposed to having been generated
	  as a result of a zone update.  [GL #513]

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  A SipHash 2-4 based DNS Cookie (RFC 7873) algorithm has been added.
	  [GL #605]
	</para>
	<para>
	  If you are running multiple DNS Servers (different versions of BIND 9
	  or DNS server from multiple vendors) responding from the same IP
	  address (anycast or load-balancing scenarios), you'll have to make
	  sure that all the servers are configured with the same DNS Cookie
	  algorithm and same Server Secret for the best performance.

	  DS records included in DNS referral messages can now be validated
	  and cached immediately, reducing the number of queries needed for
	  a DNSSEC validation. [GL #964]

	  When <command>qname-minimization</command> was set to
	  <command>relaxed</command>, some improperly configured domains
	  would fail to resolve, but would have succeeded if minimization
	  were disabled. <command>named</command> will now fall back to normal
	  resolution in such cases, and also uses type A rather than NS for
	  minimal queries in order to reduce the likelihood of encountering
	  the problem. [GL #1055]

	  Cache database statistics counters could report invalid values
	  when stale answers were enabled, because of a bug in counter
	  maintenance when cache data becomes stale. The statistics counters

	  RR type that are active, stale but still potentially served,
