      BIND 9.13 is an unstable development release of BIND.
      This document summarizes new features and functional changes that
      have been introduced on this branch.  With each development release
      leading up to the stable BIND 9.14 release, this document will be
      updated with additional features added and bugs fixed.
    </para>
    <para>
      BIND 9.13.5-W1 is a minimal patch release, addressing a build error
      on Windows systems that caused some files to be omitted from the ZIP
      files originally published for BIND 9.13.5. There is no need to use
      BIND 9.13.5-W1 on any operating system other than Windows.
    </para>

  <section xml:id="relnotes_versions"><info><title>Note on Version Numbering</title></info>
    <para>
      Prior to BIND 9.13, new feature development releases were tagged
      as "alpha" and "beta", leading up to the first stable release
      for a given development branch, which always ended in ".0".
    </para>
    <para>
      Now, however, BIND has adopted the "odd-unstable/even-stable"
      release numbering convention. There will be no "alpha" or "beta"
      releases in the 9.13 branch, only increasing version numbers.
      So, for example, what would previously have been called 9.13.0a1,
      9.13.0a2, 9.13.0b1, and so on, will instead be called 9.13.0,
      9.13.1, 9.13.2, etc.
    </para>
    <para>
      The first stable release from this development branch will be
      renamed as 9.14.0. Thereafter, maintenance releases will continue
      on the 9.14 branch, while unstable feature development proceeds in
      9.15.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="relnotes_platforms"><info><title>Supported Platforms</title></info>
    <para>
      BIND 9.13 has undergone substantial code refactoring and cleanup,
      and some very old code has been removed that was needed to support
      legacy platforms which are no longer supported by their vendors
      and for which ISC is no longer able to perform quality assurance
      testing.  Specifically, workarounds for old versions of UnixWare,
      BSD/OS, AIX, Tru64, SunOS, TruCluster and IRIX have been removed.
      On UNIX-like systems, BIND now requires support for POSIX.1c
      threads (IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995), the Advanced Sockets API for
      IPv6 (RFC 3542), and standard atomic operations provided by the
      C compiler.
    </para>
    <para>
      More information can be found in the <filename>PLATFORM.md</filename>
      file that is included in the source distribution of BIND 9.  If your
      platform compiler and system libraries provide the above features,
      BIND 9 should compile and run. If that isn't the case, the BIND
      development team will generally accept patches that add support
      for systems that are still supported by their respective vendors.
    </para>
    <para>
      As of BIND 9.13, the BIND development team has also made cryptography
      (i.e., TSIG and DNSSEC) an integral part of the DNS server.  The
      OpenSSL cryptography library must be available for the target
      platform.  A PKCS#11 provider can be used instead for Public Key
      cryptography (i.e., DNSSEC signing and validation), but OpenSSL is
      still required for general cryptography operations such as hashing
      and random number generation.

          the policies worked as intended, operators who configured their
          servers according to the misleading documentation may have
          thought zone updates were more restricted than they were;
          users of these rule types are advised to review the documentation
          and correct their configurations if necessary.  New rule types
          matching the previously documented behavior will be introduced

	  Task manager and socket code have been substantially modified.
	  The manager uses per-cpu queues for tasks and network stack runs
	  multiple event loops in CPU-affinitive threads. This greatly
	  improves performance on large systems, especially when using
	  multi-queue NICs.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  A new secondary zone option, <command>mirror</command>,
	  enables <command>named</command> to serve a transferred copy
	  of a zone's contents without acting as an authority for the
	  zone. A zone must be fully validated against an active trust
	  anchor before it can be used as a mirror zone. DNS responses
	  from mirror zones do not set the AA bit ("authoritative answer"),
	  but do set the AD bit ("authenticated data"). This feature is
	  meant to facilitate deployment of a local copy of the root zone,
	  as described in RFC 7706. [GL #33]
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  A new <command>plugin</command> mechanism has been added to allow
	  extension of query processing functionality through the use of
	  external libraries. The new <filename>filter-aaaa.so</filename>
	  plugin replaces the <command>filter-aaaa</command> feature that
	  was formerly implemented as a native part of BIND.

	<para>
	  The plugin API is a work in progress and is likely to evolve
	  as further plugins are implemented. [GL #15]

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  BIND now can be compiled against the <command>libidn2</command>
	  library to add IDNA2008 support.  Previously, BIND supported

	  <command>idnkit-1</command> library.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <command>named</command> now supports the "root key sentinel"
	  mechanism. This enables validating resolvers to indicate
	  which trust anchors are configured for the root, so that
	  information about root key rollover status can be gathered.
	  To disable this feature, add

	  Support for QNAME minimization was added and enabled by default
	  in <command>relaxed</command> mode, in which BIND will fall back

	  When built on Linux, BIND now requires the <command>libcap</command>
	  library to set process privileges.  The adds a new compile-time
	  dependency, which can be met on most Linux platforms by installing the
	  <command>libcap-dev</command> or <command>libcap-devel</command>
	  package. BIND can also be built without capability support by using
	  <command>configure --disable-linux-caps</command>, at the cost of some
	  loss of security.

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  The <command>validate-except</command> option specifies a list of

	  Two new update policy rule types have been added

	<para>
	  The new configure option <command>--enable-fips-mode</command>
	  can be used to make BIND enable and enforce FIPS mode in the
	  OpenSSL library.  When compiled with such option the BIND will
	  refuse to run if FIPS mode can't be enabled, thus this option
	  must be only enabled for the systems where FIPS mode is available.

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Two new configuration options <command>min-cache-ttl</command> and
	  <command>min-ncache-ttl</command> has been added to allow the BIND 9
	  administrator to override the minimum TTL in the received DNS records
	  (positive caching) and for storing the information about non-existent
	  records (negative caching).  The configured minimum TTL for both
	  configuration options cannot exceed 90 seconds.

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Workarounds for servers that misbehave when queried with EDNS
	  have been removed, because these broken servers and the
	  workarounds for their noncompliance cause unnecessary delays,
	  increase code complexity, and prevent deployment of new DNS
	  features. See <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
	    xlink:href="https://dnsflagday.net">https://dnsflagday.net</link>
	  for further details.
	</para>
	<para>
	  In particular, resolution will no longer fall back to
	  plain DNS when there was no response from an authoritative
	  server.  This will cause some domains to become non-resolvable
	  without manual intervention.  In these cases, resolution can
	  be restored by adding <command>server</command> clauses for the
	  offending servers, specifying <command>edns no</command> or
	  <command>send-cookie no</command>, depending on the specific
	  noncompliance.
	</para>
	<para>
	  To determine which <command>server</command> clause to use, run
	  the following commands to send queries to the authoritative
	  servers for the broken domain:
	</para>
<literallayout>
	  dig soa &lt;zone&gt; @&lt;server&gt; +dnssec
	  dig soa &lt;zone&gt; @&lt;server&gt; +dnssec +nocookie
	  dig soa &lt;zone&gt; @&lt;server&gt; +noedns
</literallayout>
	<para>
	  If the first command fails but the second succeeds, the
	  server most likely needs <command>send-cookie no</command>.
	  If the first two fail but the third succeeds, then the server
	  needs EDNS to be fully disabled with <command>edns no</command>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Please contact the administrators of noncompliant domains
	  and encourage them to upgrade their broken DNS servers. [GL #150]

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Previously, it was possible to build BIND without thread support
	  for old architectures and systems without threads support.
	  BIND now requires threading support (either POSIX or Windows) from
	  the operating system, and it cannot be built without threads.

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  The <command>filter-aaaa</command>,
	  <command>filter-aaaa-on-v4</command>, and

	  from <command>named</command>, and can no longer be
	  configured using native <filename>named.conf</filename> syntax.
	  However, loading the new <filename>filter-aaaa.so</filename>
	  plugin and setting its parameters provides identical

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <command>named</command> can no longer use the EDNS CLIENT-SUBNET
	  option for view selection.  In its existing form, the authoritative
	  ECS feature was not fully RFC-compliant, and could not realistically
	  have been deployed in production for an authoritative server; its
	  only practical use was for testing and experimentation. In the
	  interest of code simplification, this feature has now been removed.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The ECS option is still supported in <command>dig</command> and
	  <command>mdig</command> via the +subnet argument, and can be parsed
	  and logged when received by <command>named</command>, but
	  it is no longer used for ACL processing. The
	  <command>geoip-use-ecs</command> option is now obsolete;
	  a warning will be logged if it is used in
	  <filename>named.conf</filename>.
	  <command>ecs</command> tags in an ACL definition are

	  Support for ECC-GOST (GOST R 34.11-94) algorithm has been
	  removed from BIND as the algorithm has been superseded by
	  GOST R 34.11-2012 in RFC6986 and it must not be used in new

	  signatures and digest, nor it will validate them.

	  Add the ability to not return a DNS COOKIE option when one

	  add 'answer-cookie no;' to named.conf. [GL #173]
	</para>
	<para>
	  <command>answer-cookie</command> is only intended as a temporary
	  measure, for use when <command>named</command> shares an IP address
	  with other servers that do not yet support DNS COOKIE.  A mismatch
	  between servers on the same address is not expected to cause
	  operational problems, but the option to disable COOKIE responses so
	  that all servers have the same behavior is provided out of an
	  abundance of caution. DNS COOKIE is an important security mechanism,
	  and should not be disabled unless absolutely necessary.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Remove support for silently ignoring 'no-change' deltas from
	  BIND 8 when processing an IXFR stream.  'no-change' deltas
	  will now trigger a fallback to AXFR as the recovery mechanism.
	</para>
	<para>
	  BIND 9 will no longer build on platforms that doesn't have
	  proper IPv6 support.  BIND 9 now also requires non-broken
	  POSIX-compatible pthread support.  Such platforms are
	  usually long after their end-of-life date and they are
	  neither developed nor supported by their respective vendors.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Support for DSA and DSA-NSEC3-SHA1 algorithms has been
	  removed from BIND as the DSA key length is limited to 1024

    <para>
      BIND is open source software licenced under the terms of the Mozilla
      Public License, version 2.0 (see the <filename>LICENSE</filename>
      file for the full text).
    </para>
    <para>
      The license requires that if you make changes to BIND and distribute
      them outside your organization, those changes must be published under
      the same license. It does not require that you publish or disclose
      anything other than the changes you have made to our software.  This
      requirement does not affect anyone who is using BIND, with or without
      modifications, without redistributing it, nor anyone redistributing
      BIND without changes.
