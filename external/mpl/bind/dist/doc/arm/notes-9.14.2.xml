          When <command>trusted-keys</command> and
          <command>managed-keys</command> are both configured for the
          same name, or when <command>trusted-keys</command> is used to
          configure a trust anchor for the root zone and
          <command>dnssec-validation</command> is set to the default
          value of <literal>auto</literal>, automatic RFC 5011 key
          rollovers will fail.

          This combination of settings was never intended to work,
          but there was no check for it in the parser. This has been
          corrected; a warning is now logged. (In BIND 9.15 and
          higher this error will be fatal.) [GL #868]
