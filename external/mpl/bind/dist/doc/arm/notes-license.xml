    BIND is open source software licensed under the terms of the Mozilla
    Public License, version 2.0 (see the <filename>LICENSE</filename>
    file for the full text).

  <para>
    The license requires that if you make changes to BIND and distribute
    them outside your organization, those changes must be published under
    the same license. It does not require that you publish or disclose
    anything other than the changes you have made to our software.  This
    requirement does not affect anyone who is using BIND, with or without
    modifications, without redistributing it, nor anyone redistributing
    BIND without changes.
