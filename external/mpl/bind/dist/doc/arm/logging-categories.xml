	    Log queries that have been forced to use plain

	    the remote servers not being RFC 1034 compliant
	    (not always returning FORMERR or similar to
	    EDNS queries and other extensions to the DNS
	    when they are not understood).  In other words, this is
	    targeted at servers that fail to respond to
	    DNS queries that they don't understand.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Note: the log message can also be due to
	    packet loss.  Before reporting servers for
	    non-RFC 1034 compliance they should be re-tested
	    to determine the nature of the non-compliance.
	    This testing should prevent or reduce the
	    number of false-positive reports.

	  <para>
	    Note: eventually <command>named</command> will have to stop
	    treating such timeouts as due to RFC 1034 non
	    compliance and start treating it as plain
	    packet loss.  Falsely classifying packet
	    loss as due to RFC 1034 non compliance impacts
	    on DNSSEC validation which requires EDNS for
	    the DNSSEC records to be returned.

	    The query log entry first reports a client object
	    identifier in @0x&lt;hexadecimal-number&gt;
	    format. Next, it reports the client's IP
	    address and port number, and the query name,
	    class and type.  Next, it reports whether the
	    Recursion Desired flag was set (+ if set, -
	    if not set), whether the query was signed (S),
	    whether EDNS was in use along with the EDNS version
	    number (E(#)), whether TCP was used (T), whether
	    DO (DNSSEC Ok) was set (D), whether CD (Checking
	    Disabled) was set (C), whether a valid DNS Server
	    COOKIE was received (V), and whether a DNS
	    COOKIE option without a valid Server COOKIE was
	    present (K).  After this the destination
	    address the query was sent to is reported.
	    Finally, if any CLIENT-SUBNET option
	    was present in the client query, it is
	    included in square brackets in the format
	    [ECS <replaceable>address/source/scope</replaceable>].
