    <para>
      The Internet Domain Name System (<acronym>DNS</acronym>)
      consists of the syntax
      to specify the names of entities in the Internet in a hierarchical
      manner, the rules used for delegating authority over names, and the
      system implementation that actually maps names to Internet
      addresses.  <acronym>DNS</acronym> data is maintained in a
      group of distributed
      hierarchical databases.

    <section xml:id="dns_overview"><info><title>The Domain Name System (<acronym>DNS</acronym>)</title></info>

      <para>
	The purpose of this document is to explain the installation
	and upkeep of the <acronym>BIND</acronym> (Berkeley Internet
	Name Domain) software package, and we
	begin by reviewing the fundamentals of the Domain Name System
	(<acronym>DNS</acronym>) as they relate to <acronym>BIND</acronym>.
      </para>

      <section xml:id="dns_fundamentals"><info><title>DNS Fundamentals</title></info>

	<para>
	  The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical, distributed
	  database.  It stores information for mapping Internet host names to
	  IP
	  addresses and vice versa, mail routing information, and other data
	  used by Internet applications.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Clients look up information in the DNS by calling a
	  <emphasis>resolver</emphasis> library, which sends queries to one or
	  more <emphasis>name servers</emphasis> and interprets the responses.
	  The <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 software distribution
	  contains a name server, <command>named</command>, and a set
	  of associated tools.
	</para>

	</section>
	<section xml:id="domain_names"><info><title>Domains and Domain Names</title></info>

	<para>
	  The data stored in the DNS is identified by <emphasis>domain names</emphasis> that are organized as a tree according to
	  organizational or administrative boundaries. Each node of the tree,
	  called a <emphasis>domain</emphasis>, is given a label. The domain
	  name of the
	  node is the concatenation of all the labels on the path from the
	  node to the <emphasis>root</emphasis> node.  This is represented
	  in written form as a string of labels listed from right to left and
	  separated by dots. A label need only be unique within its parent
	  domain.
	</para>

	<para>
	  For example, a domain name for a host at the
	  company <emphasis>Example, Inc.</emphasis> could be
	  <literal>ourhost.example.com</literal>,
	  where <literal>com</literal> is the
	  top level domain to which
	  <literal>ourhost.example.com</literal> belongs,
	  <literal>example</literal> is
	  a subdomain of <literal>com</literal>, and
	  <literal>ourhost</literal> is the
	  name of the host.
	</para>

	<para>
	  For administrative purposes, the name space is partitioned into
	  areas called <emphasis>zones</emphasis>, each starting at a node and
	  extending down to the leaf nodes or to nodes where other zones
	  start.
	  The data for each zone is stored in a <emphasis>name server</emphasis>, which answers queries about the zone using the
	  <emphasis>DNS protocol</emphasis>.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The data associated with each domain name is stored in the
	  form of <emphasis>resource records</emphasis> (<acronym>RR</acronym>s).
	  Some of the supported resource record types are described in
	  <xref linkend="types_of_resource_records_and_when_to_use_them"/>.
	</para>

	<para>
	  For more detailed information about the design of the DNS and
	  the DNS protocol, please refer to the standards documents listed in
	  <xref linkend="rfcs"/>.
	</para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="zones"><info><title>Zones</title></info>

	<para>
	  To properly operate a name server, it is important to understand
	  the difference between a <emphasis>zone</emphasis>
	  and a <emphasis>domain</emphasis>.
	</para>

	<para>
	  As stated previously, a zone is a point of delegation in
	  the <acronym>DNS</acronym> tree. A zone consists of
	  those contiguous parts of the domain
	  tree for which a name server has complete information and over which
	  it has authority. It contains all domain names from a certain point
	  downward in the domain tree except those which are delegated to
	  other zones. A delegation point is marked by one or more
	  <emphasis>NS records</emphasis> in the
	  parent zone, which should be matched by equivalent NS records at
	  the root of the delegated zone.
	</para>

	<para>
	  For instance, consider the <literal>example.com</literal>
	  domain which includes names
	  such as <literal>host.aaa.example.com</literal> and
	  <literal>host.bbb.example.com</literal> even though
	  the <literal>example.com</literal> zone includes
	  only delegations for the <literal>aaa.example.com</literal> and
	  <literal>bbb.example.com</literal> zones.  A zone can
	  map
	  exactly to a single domain, but could also include only part of a
	  domain, the rest of which could be delegated to other
	  name servers. Every name in the <acronym>DNS</acronym>
	  tree is a
	  <emphasis>domain</emphasis>, even if it is
	  <emphasis>terminal</emphasis>, that is, has no
	  <emphasis>subdomains</emphasis>.  Every subdomain is a domain and
	  every domain except the root is also a subdomain. The terminology is
	  not intuitive and we suggest that you read RFCs 1033, 1034 and 1035
	  to
	  gain a complete understanding of this difficult and subtle
	  topic.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Though <acronym>BIND</acronym> is called a "domain name
	  server",
	  it deals primarily in terms of zones. The master and slave
	  declarations in the <filename>named.conf</filename> file
	  specify
	  zones, not domains. When you ask some other site if it is willing to
	  be a slave server for your <emphasis>domain</emphasis>, you are
	  actually asking for slave service for some collection of zones.
	</para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="auth_servers"><info><title>Authoritative Name Servers</title></info>

	<para>
	  Each zone is served by at least
	  one <emphasis>authoritative name server</emphasis>,
	  which contains the complete data for the zone.
	  To make the DNS tolerant of server and network failures,
	  most zones have two or more authoritative servers, on
	  different networks.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Responses from authoritative servers have the "authoritative
	  answer" (AA) bit set in the response packets.  This makes them
	  easy to identify when debugging DNS configurations using tools like
	  <command>dig</command> (<xref linkend="diagnostic_tools"/>).
	</para>

	<section xml:id="primary_master"><info><title>The Primary Master</title></info>

	  <para>
	    The authoritative server where the master copy of the zone
	    data is maintained is called the
	    <emphasis>primary master</emphasis> server, or simply the
	    <emphasis>primary</emphasis>.  Typically it loads the zone
	    contents from some local file edited by humans or perhaps
	    generated mechanically from some other local file which is
	    edited by humans.  This file is called the
	    <emphasis>zone file</emphasis> or
	    <emphasis>master file</emphasis>.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    In some cases, however, the master file may not be edited
	    by humans at all, but may instead be the result of
	    <emphasis>dynamic update</emphasis> operations.
	  </para>
	</section>

	<section xml:id="slave_server"><info><title>Slave Servers</title></info>

	  <para>
	    The other authoritative servers, the <emphasis>slave</emphasis>
	    servers (also known as <emphasis>secondary</emphasis> servers)
	    load the zone contents from another server using a replication
	    process known as a <emphasis>zone transfer</emphasis>.
	    Typically the data are transferred directly from the primary
	    master, but it is also possible to transfer it from another
	    slave.  In other words, a slave server may itself act as a
	    master to a subordinate slave server.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Periodically, the slave server must send a refresh query to
	    determine whether the zone contents have been updated. This
	    is done by sending a query for the zone's SOA record and
	    checking whether the SERIAL field has been updated; if so,
	    a new transfer request is initiated. The timing of these
	    refresh queries is controlled by the SOA REFRESH and RETRY
	    fields, but can be overrridden with the
	    <command>max-refresh-time</command>,
	    <command>min-refresh-time</command>,
	    <command>max-retry-time</command>, and
	    <command>min-retry-time</command> options.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If the zone data cannot be updated within the time specified
	    by the SOA EXPIRE option (up to a hard-coded maximum of
	    24 weeks) then the slave zone expires and will no longer
	    respond to queries.
	  </para>
	</section>

	<section xml:id="stealth_server"><info><title>Stealth Servers</title></info>

	  <para>
	    Usually all of the zone's authoritative servers are listed in
	    NS records in the parent zone.  These NS records constitute
	    a <emphasis>delegation</emphasis> of the zone from the parent.
	    The authoritative servers are also listed in the zone file itself,
	    at the <emphasis>top level</emphasis> or <emphasis>apex</emphasis>
	    of the zone.  You can list servers in the zone's top-level NS
	    records that are not in the parent's NS delegation, but you cannot
	    list servers in the parent's delegation that are not present at
	    the zone's top level.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    A <emphasis>stealth server</emphasis> is a server that is
	    authoritative for a zone but is not listed in that zone's NS
	    records.  Stealth servers can be used for keeping a local copy of
	    a
	    zone to speed up access to the zone's records or to make sure that
	    the
	    zone is available even if all the "official" servers for the zone
	    are
	    inaccessible.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    A configuration where the primary master server itself is a
	    stealth server is often referred to as a "hidden primary"
	    configuration.  One use for this configuration is when the primary
	    master
	    is behind a firewall and therefore unable to communicate directly
	    with the outside world.
	  </para>

	</section>

      </section>
      <section xml:id="cache_servers"><info><title>Caching Name Servers</title></info>

	<!--
	  - Terminology here is inconsistent.  Probably ought to
	  - convert to using "recursive name server" everywhere
	  - with just a note about "caching" terminology.
	  -->

	<para>
	  The resolver libraries provided by most operating systems are
	  <emphasis>stub resolvers</emphasis>, meaning that they are not
	  capable of
	  performing the full DNS resolution process by themselves by talking
	  directly to the authoritative servers.  Instead, they rely on a
	  local
	  name server to perform the resolution on their behalf.  Such a
	  server
	  is called a <emphasis>recursive</emphasis> name server; it performs
	  <emphasis>recursive lookups</emphasis> for local clients.
	</para>

	<para>
	  To improve performance, recursive servers cache the results of
	  the lookups they perform.  Since the processes of recursion and
	  caching are intimately connected, the terms
	  <emphasis>recursive server</emphasis> and
	  <emphasis>caching server</emphasis> are often used synonymously.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The length of time for which a record may be retained in
	  the cache of a caching name server is controlled by the
	  Time To Live (TTL) field associated with each resource record.
	</para>

	<section xml:id="forwarder"><info><title>Forwarding</title></info>

	  <para>
	    Even a caching name server does not necessarily perform
	    the complete recursive lookup itself.  Instead, it can
	    <emphasis>forward</emphasis> some or all of the queries
	    that it cannot satisfy from its cache to another caching name
	    server,
	    commonly referred to as a <emphasis>forwarder</emphasis>.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    There may be one or more forwarders,
	    and they are queried in turn until the list is exhausted or an
	    answer
	    is found. Forwarders are typically used when you do not
	    wish all the servers at a given site to interact directly with the
	    rest of
	    the Internet servers. A typical scenario would involve a number
	    of internal <acronym>DNS</acronym> servers and an
	    Internet firewall. Servers unable
	    to pass packets through the firewall would forward to the server
	    that can do it, and that server would query the Internet <acronym>DNS</acronym> servers
	    on the internal server's behalf.
	  </para>
	</section>

      </section>

      <section xml:id="multi_role"><info><title>Name Servers in Multiple Roles</title></info>

	<para>
	  The <acronym>BIND</acronym> name server can
	  simultaneously act as
	  a master for some zones, a slave for other zones, and as a caching
	  (recursive) server for a set of local clients.
	</para>

	<para>
	  However, since the functions of authoritative name service
	  and caching/recursive name service are logically separate, it is
	  often advantageous to run them on separate server machines.

	  A server that only provides authoritative name service
	  (an <emphasis>authoritative-only</emphasis> server) can run with
	  recursion disabled, improving reliability and security.

	  A server that is not authoritative for any zones and only provides
	  recursive service to local
	  clients (a <emphasis>caching-only</emphasis> server)
	  does not need to be reachable from the Internet at large and can
	  be placed inside a firewall.

      <para>
	<acronym>DNS</acronym> hardware requirements have
	traditionally been quite modest.
	For many installations, servers that have been pensioned off from
	active duty have performed admirably as <acronym>DNS</acronym> servers.
      </para>
      <para>
	The DNSSEC features of <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9
	may prove to be quite
	CPU intensive however, so organizations that make heavy use of these
	features may wish to consider larger systems for these applications.
	<acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 is fully multithreaded, allowing
	full utilization of
	multiprocessor systems for installations that need it.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="cpu_req"><info><title>CPU Requirements</title></info>
      <para>
	CPU requirements for <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 range from
	i486-class machines
	for serving of static zones without caching, to enterprise-class
	machines if you intend to process many dynamic updates and DNSSEC
	signed zones, serving many thousands of queries per second.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="mem_req"><info><title>Memory Requirements</title></info>
      <para>
	The memory of the server has to be large enough to fit the
	cache and zones loaded off disk.  The <command>max-cache-size</command>
	option can be used to limit the amount of memory used by the cache,
	at the expense of reducing cache hit rates and causing more <acronym>DNS</acronym>
	traffic.
	It is still good practice to have enough memory to load
	all zone and cache data into memory — unfortunately, the best
	way
	to determine this for a given installation is to watch the name server
	in operation. After a few weeks the server process should reach
	a relatively stable size where entries are expiring from the cache as
	fast as they are being inserted.

    <section xml:id="intensive_env"><info><title>Name Server Intensive Environment Issues</title></info>

      <para>
	For name server intensive environments, there are two alternative
	configurations that may be used. The first is where clients and
	any second-level internal name servers query a main name server, which
	has enough memory to build a large cache. This approach minimizes
	the bandwidth used by external name lookups. The second alternative
	is to set up second-level internal name servers to make queries
	independently.
	In this configuration, none of the individual machines needs to
	have as much memory or CPU power as in the first alternative, but
	this has the disadvantage of making many more external queries,
	as none of the name servers share their cached data.

		</para>

		<para>
		  <command>rndc</command> requires a configuration file,
		  since all
		  communication with the server is authenticated with
		  digital signatures that rely on a shared secret, and
		  there is no way to provide that secret other than with a
		  configuration file.  The default location for the
		  <command>rndc</command> configuration file is
		  <filename>/etc/rndc.conf</filename>, but an
		  alternate
		  location can be specified with the <option>-c</option>
		  option.  If the configuration file is not found,
		  <command>rndc</command> will also look in
		  <filename>/etc/rndc.key</filename> (or whatever
		  <varname>sysconfdir</varname> was defined when
		  the <acronym>BIND</acronym> build was
		  configured).
		  The <filename>rndc.key</filename> file is
		  generated by
		  running <command>rndc-confgen -a</command> as
		  described in
		  <xref linkend="controls_statement_definition_and_usage"/>.
		</para>

		<para>
		  The format of the configuration file is similar to
		  that of <filename>named.conf</filename>, but
		  limited to
		  only four statements, the <command>options</command>,
		  <command>key</command>, <command>server</command> and
		  <command>include</command>
		  statements.  These statements are what associate the
		  secret keys to the servers with which they are meant to
		  be shared.  The order of statements is not
		  significant.
		</para>

		<para>
		  The <command>options</command> statement has
		  three clauses:
		  <command>default-server</command>, <command>default-key</command>,
		  and <command>default-port</command>.
		  <command>default-server</command> takes a
		  host name or address argument  and represents the server
		  that will
		  be contacted if no <option>-s</option>
		  option is provided on the command line.
		  <command>default-key</command> takes
		  the name of a key as its argument, as defined by a <command>key</command> statement.
		  <command>default-port</command> specifies the
		  port to which
		  <command>rndc</command> should connect if no
		  port is given on the command line or in a
		  <command>server</command> statement.
		</para>

		<para>
		  The <command>key</command> statement defines a
		  key to be used
		  by <command>rndc</command> when authenticating
		  with
		  <command>named</command>.  Its syntax is
		  identical to the
		  <command>key</command> statement in <filename>named.conf</filename>.
		  The keyword <userinput>key</userinput> is
		  followed by a key name, which must be a valid
		  domain name, though it need not actually be hierarchical;
		  thus,
		  a string like "<userinput>rndc_key</userinput>" is a valid
		  name.
		  The <command>key</command> statement has two
		  clauses:
		  <command>algorithm</command> and <command>secret</command>.
		  While the configuration parser will accept any string as the
		  argument
		  to algorithm, currently only the strings
		  "<userinput>hmac-md5</userinput>",
		  "<userinput>hmac-sha1</userinput>",
		  "<userinput>hmac-sha224</userinput>",
		  "<userinput>hmac-sha256</userinput>",
		  "<userinput>hmac-sha384</userinput>"
		  and "<userinput>hmac-sha512</userinput>"
		  have any meaning.  The secret is a Base64 encoded string
		  as specified in RFC 3548.
		</para>

		<para>
		  The <command>server</command> statement
		  associates a key
		  defined using the <command>key</command>
		  statement with a server.
		  The keyword <userinput>server</userinput> is followed by a
		  host name or address.  The <command>server</command> statement
		  has two clauses: <command>key</command> and <command>port</command>.
		  The <command>key</command> clause specifies the
		  name of the key
		  to be used when communicating with this server, and the
		  <command>port</command> clause can be used to
		  specify the port <command>rndc</command> should
		  connect
		  to on the server.
		</para>

		<para>
		  A sample minimal configuration file is as follows:
		</para>

<programlisting>
key rndc_key {
     algorithm "hmac-sha256";
     secret
       "c3Ryb25nIGVub3VnaCBmb3IgYSBtYW4gYnV0IG1hZGUgZm9yIGEgd29tYW4K";
};
options {
     default-server 127.0.0.1;
     default-key    rndc_key;
};
</programlisting>

		<para>
		  This file, if installed as <filename>/etc/rndc.conf</filename>,
		  would allow the command:
		</para>

		<para>
		  <prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>rndc reload</userinput>
		</para>

		<para>
		  to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 953 and cause the name server
		  to reload, if a name server on the local machine were
		  running with
		  following controls statements:
		</para>

<programlisting>
controls {
	inet 127.0.0.1
	    allow { localhost; } keys { rndc_key; };
};
</programlisting>

		<para>
		  and it had an identical key statement for
		  <literal>rndc_key</literal>.
		</para>

		<para>
		  Running the <command>rndc-confgen</command>
		  program will
		  conveniently create a <filename>rndc.conf</filename>
		  file for you, and also display the
		  corresponding <command>controls</command>
		  statement that you need to
		  add to <filename>named.conf</filename>.
		  Alternatively,
		  you can run <command>rndc-confgen -a</command>
		  to set up
		  a <filename>rndc.key</filename> file and not
		  modify
		  <filename>named.conf</filename> at all.

      <para>
	<acronym>DNS</acronym> NOTIFY is a mechanism that allows master
	servers to notify their slave servers of changes to a zone's data. In
	response to a <command>NOTIFY</command> from a master server, the
	slave will check to see that its version of the zone is the
	current version and, if not, initiate a zone transfer.
      </para>

      <para>
	For more information about <acronym>DNS</acronym>
	<command>NOTIFY</command>, see the description of the
	<command>notify</command> option in <xref linkend="boolean_options"/> and
	the description of the zone option <command>also-notify</command> in
	<xref linkend="zone_transfers"/>.  The <command>NOTIFY</command>
	protocol is specified in RFC 1996.
      </para>

      <note><simpara>
	As a slave zone can also be a master to other slaves, <command>named</command>,
	by default, sends <command>NOTIFY</command> messages for every zone
	it loads.  Specifying <command>notify master-only;</command> will
	cause <command>named</command> to only send <command>NOTIFY</command> for master
	zones that it loads.

    <section xml:id="dynamic_update"><info><title>Dynamic Update</title></info>

      <para>
	Dynamic Update is a method for adding, replacing or deleting
	records in a master server by sending it a special form of DNS
	messages.  The format and meaning of these messages is specified
	in RFC 2136.
      </para>

      <para>
	Dynamic update is enabled by including an
	<command>allow-update</command> or an <command>update-policy</command>
	clause in the <command>zone</command> statement.
      </para>

      <para>
	If the zone's <command>update-policy</command> is set to
	<userinput>local</userinput>, updates to the zone
	will be permitted for the key <varname>local-ddns</varname>,
	which will be generated by <command>named</command> at startup.
	See <xref linkend="dynamic_update_policies"/> for more details.
      </para>

      <para>
	Dynamic updates using Kerberos signed requests can be made
	using the TKEY/GSS protocol by setting either the
	<command>tkey-gssapi-keytab</command> option, or alternatively
	by setting both the <command>tkey-gssapi-credential</command>
	and <command>tkey-domain</command> options. Once enabled,
	Kerberos signed requests will be matched against the update
	policies for the zone, using the Kerberos principal as the
	signer for the request.
      </para>

      <para>
	Updating of secure zones (zones using DNSSEC) follows RFC
	3007: RRSIG, NSEC and NSEC3 records affected by updates are
	automatically regenerated by the server using an online
	zone key.  Update authorization is based on transaction
	signatures and an explicit server policy.
      </para>

      <section xml:id="journal"><info><title>The journal file</title></info>

	<para>
	  All changes made to a zone using dynamic update are stored
	  in the zone's journal file.  This file is automatically created
	  by the server when the first dynamic update takes place.
	  The name of the journal file is formed by appending the extension
	  <filename>.jnl</filename> to the name of the
	  corresponding zone
	  file unless specifically overridden.  The journal file is in a
	  binary format and should not be edited manually.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The server will also occasionally write ("dump")
	  the complete contents of the updated zone to its zone file.
	  This is not done immediately after
	  each dynamic update, because that would be too slow when a large
	  zone is updated frequently.  Instead, the dump is delayed by
	  up to 15 minutes, allowing additional updates to take place.
	  During the dump process, transient files will be created
	  with the extensions <filename>.jnw</filename> and
	  <filename>.jbk</filename>; under ordinary circumstances, these
	  will be removed when the dump is complete, and can be safely
	  ignored.
	</para>

	<para>
	  When a server is restarted after a shutdown or crash, it will replay
	      the journal file to incorporate into the zone any updates that
	  took
	  place after the last zone dump.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Changes that result from incoming incremental zone transfers are
	  also
	  journaled in a similar way.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The zone files of dynamic zones cannot normally be edited by
	  hand because they are not guaranteed to contain the most recent
	  dynamic changes — those are only in the journal file.
	  The only way to ensure that the zone file of a dynamic zone
	  is up to date is to run <command>rndc stop</command>.
	</para>

	<para>
	  If you have to make changes to a dynamic zone
	  manually, the following procedure will work:
	  Disable dynamic updates to the zone using
	  <command>rndc freeze <replaceable>zone</replaceable></command>.
	  This will update the zone's master file with the changes
	  stored in its <filename>.jnl</filename> file.
	  Edit the zone file.  Run
	  <command>rndc thaw <replaceable>zone</replaceable></command>
	  to reload the changed zone and re-enable dynamic updates.
	</para>

	<para>
	  <command>rndc sync <replaceable>zone</replaceable></command>
	  will update the zone file with changes from the journal file
	  without stopping dynamic updates; this may be useful for viewing
	  the current zone state.  To remove the <filename>.jnl</filename>
	  file after updating the zone file, use
	  <command>rndc sync -clean</command>.

    <section xml:id="incremental_zone_transfers"><info><title>Incremental Zone Transfers (IXFR)</title></info>

      <para>
	The incremental zone transfer (IXFR) protocol is a way for
	slave servers to transfer only changed data, instead of having to
	transfer the entire zone. The IXFR protocol is specified in RFC
	1995. See <xref linkend="proposed_standards"/>.
      </para>

      <para>
	When acting as a master, <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9
	supports IXFR for those zones
	where the necessary change history information is available. These
	include master zones maintained by dynamic update and slave zones
	whose data was obtained by IXFR.  For manually maintained master
	zones, and for slave zones obtained by performing a full zone
	transfer (AXFR), IXFR is supported only if the option
	<command>ixfr-from-differences</command> is set
	to <userinput>yes</userinput>.
      </para>

      <para>

    <section xml:id="split_dns"><info><title>Split DNS</title></info>

      <para>
	Setting up different views, or visibility, of the DNS space to
	internal and external resolvers is usually referred to as a
	<emphasis>Split DNS</emphasis> setup. There are several
	reasons an organization would want to set up its DNS this way.
      </para>
      <para>
	One common reason for setting up a DNS system this way is
	to hide "internal" DNS information from "external" clients on the
	Internet. There is some debate as to whether or not this is actually
	useful.
	Internal DNS information leaks out in many ways (via email headers,
	for example) and most savvy "attackers" can find the information
	they need using other means.
	However, since listing addresses of internal servers that
	external clients cannot possibly reach can result in
	connection delays and other annoyances, an organization may
	choose to use a Split DNS to present a consistent view of itself
	to the outside world.
      </para>
      <para>
	Another common reason for setting up a Split DNS system is
	to allow internal networks that are behind filters or in RFC 1918
	space (reserved IP space, as documented in RFC 1918) to resolve DNS
	on the Internet. Split DNS can also be used to allow mail from outside
	back in to the internal network.
      </para>
      <section xml:id="split_dns_sample"><info><title>Example split DNS setup</title></info>
	<para>
	  Let's say a company named <emphasis>Example, Inc.</emphasis>
	  (<literal>example.com</literal>)
	  has several corporate sites that have an internal network with
	  reserved
	  Internet Protocol (IP) space and an external demilitarized zone (DMZ),
	  or "outside" section of a network, that is available to the public.
	</para>
	<para>
	  <emphasis>Example, Inc.</emphasis> wants its internal clients
	  to be able to resolve external hostnames and to exchange mail with
	  people on the outside. The company also wants its internal resolvers
	  to have access to certain internal-only zones that are not available
	  at all outside of the internal network.
	</para>
	<para>
	  In order to accomplish this, the company will set up two sets
	  of name servers. One set will be on the inside network (in the
	  reserved
	  IP space) and the other set will be on bastion hosts, which are
	  "proxy"
	  hosts that can talk to both sides of its network, in the DMZ.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The internal servers will be configured to forward all queries,
	  except queries for <filename>site1.internal</filename>, <filename>site2.internal</filename>, <filename>site1.example.com</filename>,
	  and <filename>site2.example.com</filename>, to the servers
	  in the
	  DMZ. These internal servers will have complete sets of information
	  for <filename>site1.example.com</filename>, <filename>site2.example.com</filename>, <filename>site1.internal</filename>,
	  and <filename>site2.internal</filename>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  To protect the <filename>site1.internal</filename> and <filename>site2.internal</filename> domains,
	  the internal name servers must be configured to disallow all queries
	  to these domains from any external hosts, including the bastion
	  hosts.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The external servers, which are on the bastion hosts, will
	  be configured to serve the "public" version of the <filename>site1</filename> and <filename>site2.example.com</filename> zones.
	  This could include things such as the host records for public servers
	  (<filename>www.example.com</filename> and <filename>ftp.example.com</filename>),
	  and mail exchange (MX)  records (<filename>a.mx.example.com</filename> and <filename>b.mx.example.com</filename>).
	</para>
	<para>
	  In addition, the public <filename>site1</filename> and <filename>site2.example.com</filename> zones
	  should have special MX records that contain wildcard (`*') records
	  pointing to the bastion hosts. This is needed because external mail
	  servers do not have any other way of looking up how to deliver mail
	  to those internal hosts. With the wildcard records, the mail will
	  be delivered to the bastion host, which can then forward it on to
	  internal hosts.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Here's an example of a wildcard MX record:
	</para>
	<programlisting>*   IN MX 10 external1.example.com.</programlisting>
	<para>
	  Now that they accept mail on behalf of anything in the internal
	  network, the bastion hosts will need to know how to deliver mail
	  to internal hosts. In order for this to work properly, the resolvers
	  on
	  the bastion hosts will need to be configured to point to the internal
	  name servers for DNS resolution.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Queries for internal hostnames will be answered by the internal
	  servers, and queries for external hostnames will be forwarded back
	  out to the DNS servers on the bastion hosts.
	</para>
	<para>
	  In order for all this to work properly, internal clients will
	  need to be configured to query <emphasis>only</emphasis> the internal
	  name servers for DNS queries. This could also be enforced via
	  selective
	  filtering on the network.
	</para>
	<para>
	  If everything has been set properly, <emphasis>Example, Inc.</emphasis>'s
	  internal clients will now be able to:

	TSIG (Transaction SIGnatures) is a mechanism for authenticating DNS
	messages, originally specified in RFC 2845. It allows DNS messages
	to be cryptographically signed using a shared secret.  TSIG can
	be used in any DNS transaction, as a way to restrict access to
	certain server functions (e.g., recursive queries) to authorized
	clients when IP-based access control is insufficient or needs to
	be overridden, or as a way to ensure message authenticity when it
	is critical to the integrity of the server, such as with dynamic
	UPDATE messages or zone transfers from a master to a slave server.

	<para>
	  TSIG keys can be generated using the <command>tsig-keygen</command>
	  command; the output of the command is a <command>key</command> directive
	  suitable for inclusion in <filename>named.conf</filename>.  The

	<para>
	  Any string which is a valid DNS name can be used as a key name.
	  For example, a key to be shared between servers called

	  be called "host1-host2.", and this key could be generated using:
	</para>
<programlisting>
  $ tsig-keygen host1-host2. > host1-host2.key

	  This key may then be copied to both hosts.  The key name and secret

	  (Note: copying a shared secret from one server to another is beyond
	  the scope of the DNS. A secure transport mechanism should be used:
	  secure FTP, SSL, ssh, telephone, encrypted email, etc.)

	<para>
	  A server sending a request to another server must be told whether

	</para>
	<para>
	  For example, a key may be specified for each server in the
	  <command>masters</command> statement in the definition of a

	  the specified key.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Keys can also be specified in a <command>server</command>
	  directive. Adding the following on <emphasis>host1</emphasis>,
	  if the IP address of <emphasis>host2</emphasis> is 10.1.2.3, would

	</para>
	<para>
	  Whenever any server sends a TSIG-signed DNS request, it will expect

      <para>
	TKEY (Transaction KEY) is a mechanism for automatically negotiating
	a shared secret between two hosts, originally specified in RFC 2930.
      </para>
      <para>
	There are several TKEY "modes" that specify how a key is to be
	generated or assigned.  <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 implements only
	one of these modes: Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  Both hosts are
	required to have a KEY record with algorithm DH (though this
	record is not required to be present in a zone).
      </para>
      <para>
	The TKEY process is initiated by a client or server by sending
	a query of type TKEY to a TKEY-aware server.  The query must include
	an appropriate KEY record in the additional section, and
	must be signed using either TSIG or SIG(0) with a previously
	established key.  The server's response, if successful, will
	contain a TKEY record in its answer section.  After this transaction,
	both participants will have enough information to calculate a
	shared secret using Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  The shared secret
	can then be used by to sign subsequent transactions between the
	two servers.
      </para>
      <para>
	TSIG keys known by the server, including TKEY-negotiated keys, can
	be listed using <command>rndc tsig-list</command>.
      </para>
      <para>
	TKEY-negotiated keys can be deleted from a server using
	<command>rndc tsig-delete</command>.  This can also be done via
	the TKEY protocol itself, by sending an authenticated TKEY query
	specifying the "key deletion" mode.
      </para>

    <section xml:id="sig0"><info><title>SIG(0)</title></info>

      <para>
	<acronym>BIND</acronym> partially supports DNSSEC SIG(0)
	transaction signatures as specified in RFC 2535 and RFC 2931.
	SIG(0) uses public/private keys to authenticate messages.  Access control
	is performed in the same manner as TSIG keys; privileges can be
	granted or denied in ACL directives based on the key name.
      </para>
      <para>
	When a SIG(0) signed message is received, it will only be
	verified if the key is known and trusted by the server. The
	server will not attempt to recursively fetch or validate the
	key.

	that the tools shipped with BIND 9.2.x and earlier are not compatible
	with the current ones.
      </para>

      <para>
	There must also be communication with the administrators of
	the parent and/or child zone to transmit keys.  A zone's security
	status must be indicated by the parent zone for a DNSSEC capable

	point.
      </para>

      <para>
	For other servers to trust data in this zone, they must

      <section xml:id="dnssec_keys"><info><title>Generating Keys</title></info>

	<para>
	  The <command>dnssec-keygen</command> program is used to
	  generate keys.
	</para>

	<para>
	  A secure zone must contain one or more zone keys.  The zone keys will
	  sign all other records in the zone, as well as the zone keys of any
	  secure delegated zones.  Zone keys must have the same name as the
	  zone, a name type of <command>ZONE</command>, and must be usable for
	  authentication.  It is recommended that zone keys use a cryptographic
	  algorithm designated as "mandatory to implement" by the IETF;
	  currently the are two algorithms: RSASHA256 and ECDSAP256SHA256.
	  ECDSAP256SHA256 is recommended for current and future deployments.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The following command will generate a ECDSAP256SHA256 key for
	  the <filename>child.example</filename> zone:
	</para>

	<para>
	  <userinput>dnssec-keygen -a ECDSAP256SHA256 -n ZONE child.example.</userinput>
	</para>

	<para>
	  Two output files will be produced:
	  <filename>Kchild.example.+013+12345.key</filename> and
	  <filename>Kchild.example.+013+12345.private</filename> (where 12345 is
	  an example of a key tag).  The key filenames contain the key name
	  (<filename>child.example.</filename>), algorithm (5 is RSASHA1, 8 is
	  RSASHA256, 13 is ECDSAP256SHA256, 15 is ED25519 etc.), and the key tag
	  (12345 in this case).  The private key (in the
	  <filename>.private</filename> file) is used to generate signatures,
	  and the public key (in the <filename>.key</filename> file) is used for
	  signature verification.
	</para>

	<para>
	  To generate another key with the same properties (but with
	  a different key tag), repeat the above command.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The <command>dnssec-keyfromlabel</command> program is used
	  to get a key pair from a crypto hardware and build the key
	  files. Its usage is similar to <command>dnssec-keygen</command>.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The public keys should be inserted into the zone file by
	  including the <filename>.key</filename> files using

	  is not specified, then DS RRsets for the secure child
	  zones need to be added manually.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The following command signs the zone, assuming it is in a
	  file called <filename>zone.child.example</filename>.  By
		default, all zone keys which have an available private key are
		used to generate signatures.
	</para>

	<para>
	  <userinput>dnssec-signzone -o child.example zone.child.example</userinput>

	  should be referenced by <filename>named.conf</filename>
	  as the
	  input file for the zone.
	</para>

	<para><command>dnssec-signzone</command>
	  will also produce a keyset and dsset files and optionally a
	  dlvset file.  These are used to provide the parent zone
	  administrators with the <literal>DNSKEYs</literal> (or their

	  <para>
	    Address match lists are primarily used to determine access
	    control for various server operations. They are also used in
	    the <command>listen-on</command> and <command>sortlist</command>
	    statements. The elements which constitute an address match
	    list can be any of the following:
	  </para>
	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <simpara>an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6)</simpara>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <simpara>an IP prefix (in `/' notation)</simpara>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <simpara>
		a key ID, as defined by the <command>key</command>
		statement
	      </simpara>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <simpara>the name of an address match list defined with
		the <command>acl</command> statement
	      </simpara>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <simpara>a nested address match list enclosed in braces</simpara>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>
	    Elements can be negated with a leading exclamation mark (`!'),
	    and the match list names "any", "none", "localhost", and
	    "localnets" are predefined. More information on those names
	    can be found in the description of the acl statement.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The addition of the key clause made the name of this syntactic
	    element something of a misnomer, since security keys can be used
	    to validate access without regard to a host or network address.
	    Nonetheless, the term "address match list" is still used
	    throughout the documentation.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    When a given IP address or prefix is compared to an address
	    match list, the comparison takes place in approximately O(1)
	    time.  However, key comparisons require that the list of keys
	    be traversed until a matching key is found, and therefore may
	    be somewhat slower.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The interpretation of a match depends on whether the list is being
	    used for access control, defining <command>listen-on</command> ports, or in a
	    <command>sortlist</command>, and whether the element was negated.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    When used as an access control list, a non-negated match
	    allows access and a negated match denies access. If
	    there is no match, access is denied. The clauses
	    <command>allow-notify</command>,
	    <command>allow-recursion</command>,
	    <command>allow-recursion-on</command>,
	    <command>allow-query</command>,
	    <command>allow-query-on</command>,
	    <command>allow-query-cache</command>,
	    <command>allow-query-cache-on</command>,
	    <command>allow-transfer</command>,
	    <command>allow-update</command>,
	    <command>allow-update-forwarding</command>,
	    <command>blackhole</command>, and
	    <command>keep-response-order</command> all use address match
	    lists.  Similarly, the <command>listen-on</command> option will cause the
	    server to refuse queries on any of the machine's
	    addresses which do not match the list.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Order of insertion is significant.  If more than one element
	    in an ACL is found to match a given IP address or prefix,
	    preference will be given to the one that came
	    <emphasis>first</emphasis> in the ACL definition.
	    Because of this first-match behavior, an element that
	    defines a subset of another element in the list should
	    come before the broader element, regardless of whether
	    either is negated. For example, in
	    <command>1.2.3/24; ! 1.2.3.13;</command>
	    the 1.2.3.13 element is completely useless because the
	    algorithm will match any lookup for 1.2.3.13 to the 1.2.3/24
	    element.  Using <command>! 1.2.3.13; 1.2.3/24</command> fixes
	    that problem by having 1.2.3.13 blocked by the negation, but
	    all other 1.2.3.* hosts fall through.

	  </para>
	  <para>
	    C-style comments start with the two characters /* (slash,
	    star) and end with */ (star, slash). Because they are completely
	    delimited with these characters, they can be used to comment only
	    a portion of a line or to span multiple lines.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    C-style comments cannot be nested. For example, the following
	    is not valid because the entire comment ends with the first */:
	  </para>
	  <para>

<programlisting>/* This is the start of a comment.
   This is still part of the comment.
/* This is an incorrect attempt at nesting a comment. */
   This is no longer in any comment. */

	  </para>

	  <para>
	    C++-style comments start with the two characters // (slash,
	    slash) and continue to the end of the physical line. They cannot
	    be continued across multiple physical lines; to have one logical
	    comment span multiple lines, each line must use the // pair.
	    For example:
	  </para>
	  <para>

<programlisting>// This is the start of a comment.  The next line
// is a new comment, even though it is logically
// part of the previous comment.
</programlisting>

	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Shell-style (or perl-style, if you prefer) comments start
	    with the character <literal>#</literal> (number sign)

	    For example:

	  Usage</title></info>

	<para>
	  The <command>controls</command> statement declares control
	  channels to be used by system administrators to control the
	  operation of the name server. These control channels are
	  used by the <command>rndc</command> utility to send
	  commands to and retrieve non-DNS results from a name server.
	</para>

	<para>
	  An <command>inet</command> control channel is a TCP socket
	  listening at the specified <command>ip_port</command> on the
	  specified <command>ip_addr</command>, which can be an IPv4 or IPv6
	  address.  An <command>ip_addr</command> of <literal>*</literal> (asterisk) is
	  interpreted as the IPv4 wildcard address; connections will be
	  accepted on any of the system's IPv4 addresses.
	  To listen on the IPv6 wildcard address,
	  use an <command>ip_addr</command> of <literal>::</literal>.
	  If you will only use <command>rndc</command> on the local host,
	  using the loopback address (<literal>127.0.0.1</literal>
	  or <literal>::1</literal>) is recommended for maximum security.
	</para>

	<para>
	  If no port is specified, port 953 is used. The asterisk
	  "<literal>*</literal>" cannot be used for <command>ip_port</command>.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The ability to issue commands over the control channel is
	  restricted by the <command>allow</command> and
	  <command>keys</command> clauses.
	  Connections to the control channel are permitted based on the
	  <command>address_match_list</command>.  This is for simple
	  IP address based filtering only; any <command>key_id</command>
	  elements of the <command>address_match_list</command>
	  are ignored.
	</para>

	<para>
	  A <command>unix</command> control channel is a UNIX domain
	  socket listening at the specified path in the file system.
	  Access to the socket is specified by the <command>perm</command>,
	  <command>owner</command> and <command>group</command> clauses.
	  Note on some platforms (SunOS and Solaris) the permissions
	  (<command>perm</command>) are applied to the parent directory
	  as the permissions on the socket itself are ignored.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The primary authorization mechanism of the command
	  channel is the <command>key_list</command>, which
	  contains a list of <command>key_id</command>s.
	  Each <command>key_id</command> in the <command>key_list</command>
	  is authorized to execute commands over the control channel.
	  See <xref linkend="rndc"/> in <xref linkend="admin_tools"/>)
	  for information about configuring keys in <command>rndc</command>.
	</para>

	<para>
	  If the <command>read-only</command> clause is enabled, the
	  control channel is limited to the following set of read-only
	  commands: <command>nta -dump</command>,
	  <command>null</command>, <command>status</command>,
	  <command>showzone</command>, <command>testgen</command>, and
	  <command>zonestatus</command>. By default,
	  <command>read-only</command> is not enabled and the control
	  channel allows read-write access.
	</para>

	<para>
	  If no <command>controls</command> statement is present,
	  <command>named</command> will set up a default
	  control channel listening on the loopback address 127.0.0.1
	  and its IPv6 counterpart ::1.
	  In this case, and also when the <command>controls</command> statement
	  is present but does not have a <command>keys</command> clause,
	  <command>named</command> will attempt to load the command channel key
	  from the file <filename>rndc.key</filename> in
	  <filename>/etc</filename> (or whatever <varname>sysconfdir</varname>
	  was specified as when <acronym>BIND</acronym> was built).
	  To create a <filename>rndc.key</filename> file, run
	  <userinput>rndc-confgen -a</userinput>.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The <filename>rndc.key</filename> feature was created to
	  ease the transition of systems from <acronym>BIND</acronym> 8,
	  which did not have digital signatures on its command channel
	  messages and thus did not have a <command>keys</command> clause.

	  It makes it possible to use an existing <acronym>BIND</acronym> 8
	  configuration file in <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 unchanged,
	  and still have <command>rndc</command> work the same way
	  <command>ndc</command> worked in BIND 8, simply by executing the
	  command <userinput>rndc-confgen -a</userinput> after BIND 9 is
	  installed.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Since the <filename>rndc.key</filename> feature
	  is only intended to allow the backward-compatible usage of
	  <acronym>BIND</acronym> 8 configuration files, this
	  feature does not
	  have a high degree of configurability.  You cannot easily change
	  the key name or the size of the secret, so you should make a
	  <filename>rndc.conf</filename> with your own key if you
	  wish to change
	  those things.  The <filename>rndc.key</filename> file
	  also has its
	  permissions set such that only the owner of the file (the user that
	  <command>named</command> is running as) can access it.
	  If you
	  desire greater flexibility in allowing other users to access
	  <command>rndc</command> commands, then you need to create
	  a
	  <filename>rndc.conf</filename> file and make it group
	  readable by a group
	  that contains the users who should have access.
	</para>

	<para>
	  To disable the command channel, use an empty
	  <command>controls</command> statement:
	  <command>controls { };</command>.

      <section xml:id="logging_statement"><info><title><command>logging</command> Statement Definition and Usage</title></info>

	<para>
	  The <command>logging</command> statement configures a
	  wide
	  variety of logging options for the name server. Its <command>channel</command> phrase
	  associates output methods, format options and severity levels with
	  a name that can then be used with the <command>category</command> phrase
	  to select how various classes of messages are logged.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Only one <command>logging</command> statement is used to
	  define
	  as many channels and categories as are wanted. If there is no <command>logging</command> statement,
	  the logging configuration will be:
	</para>

<programlisting>logging {
     category default { default_syslog; default_debug; };
     category unmatched { null; };
};
</programlisting>

	<para>
	  If <command>named</command> is started with the
	  <option>-L</option> option, it logs to the specified file
	  at startup, instead of using syslog. In this case the logging
	  configuration will be:
	</para>

<programlisting>logging {
     category default { default_logfile; default_debug; };
     category unmatched { null; };
};
</programlisting>

	<para>
	  The logging configuration is only established when
	  the entire configuration file has been parsed.
	  When the server is starting up, all logging messages
	  regarding syntax errors in the configuration file go to the default
	  channels, or to standard error if the <option>-g</option> option
	  was specified.
	</para>

	<section xml:id="channel"><info><title>The <command>channel</command> Phrase</title></info>

	  <para>
	    All log output goes to one or more <emphasis>channels</emphasis>;
	    you can make as many of them as you want.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Every channel definition must include a destination clause that
	    says whether messages selected for the channel go to a file, to a
	    particular syslog facility, to the standard error stream, or are
	    discarded. It can optionally also limit the message severity level
	    that will be accepted by the channel (the default is
	    <command>info</command>), and whether to include a
	    <command>named</command>-generated time stamp, the
	    category name
	    and/or severity level (the default is not to include any).
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>null</command> destination clause
	    causes all messages sent to the channel to be discarded;
	    in that case, other options for the channel are meaningless.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>file</command> destination clause directs
	    the channel to a disk file.  It can include additional
	    arguments to specify how large the file is allowed to
	    become before it is rolled to a backup file
	    (<command>size</command>), how many backup versions of
	    the file will be saved each time this happens
	    (<command>versions</command>), and the format to use
	    for naming backup versions (<command>suffix</command>).
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>size</command> option is used to limit
	    log file growth. If the file ever exceeds the specified
	    size, then <command>named</command> will stop writing to the
	    file unless it has a <command>versions</command> option
	    associated with it. If backup versions are kept, the files
	    are rolled as described below.  If there is no
	    <command>versions</command> option, no more data will
	    be written to the log until some out-of-band mechanism
	    removes or truncates the log to less than the maximum size.
	    The default behavior is not to limit the size of the file.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    File rolling only occurs when the file exceeds the size
	    specified with the <command>size</command> option. No
	    backup versions are kept by default; any existing
	    log file is simply appended.  The
	    <command>versions</command> option specifies
	    how many backup versions of the file should be kept.
	    If set to <literal>unlimited</literal>, there is no limit.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The <command>suffix</command> option can be set to
	    either <literal>increment</literal> or
	    <literal>timestamp</literal>.  If set to
	    <literal>timestamp</literal>, then when a log file is
	    rolled, it is saved with the current timestamp as a
	    file suffix. If set to <literal>increment</literal>,
	    then backup files are saved with incrementing numbers
	    as suffixes; older files are renamed when rolling.
	    For example, if <command>versions</command>
	    is set to 3 and <command>suffix</command> to
	    <literal>increment</literal>, then when
	    <filename>filename.log</filename> reaches the size
	    specified by <command>size</command>,
	    <filename>filename.log.1</filename> is renamed to
	    <filename>filename.log.2</filename>,
	    <filename>filename.log.0</filename> is renamed
	    to <filename>filename.log.1</filename>,
	    and <filename>filename.log</filename> is
	    renamed to <filename>filename.log.0</filename>,
	    whereupon a new <filename>filename.log</filename> is
	    opened.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Example usage of the <command>size</command>,
	    <command>versions</command>, and <command>suffix</command>
	    options:
	  </para>

<programlisting>channel an_example_channel {
    file "example.log" versions 3 size 20m suffix increment;
    print-time yes;
    print-category yes;
};
</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    The <command>syslog</command> destination clause
	    directs the
	    channel to the system log.  Its argument is a
	    syslog facility as described in the <command>syslog</command> man
	    page. Known facilities are <command>kern</command>, <command>user</command>,
	    <command>mail</command>, <command>daemon</command>, <command>auth</command>,
	    <command>syslog</command>, <command>lpr</command>, <command>news</command>,
	    <command>uucp</command>, <command>cron</command>, <command>authpriv</command>,
	    <command>ftp</command>, <command>local0</command>, <command>local1</command>,
	    <command>local2</command>, <command>local3</command>, <command>local4</command>,
	    <command>local5</command>, <command>local6</command> and
	    <command>local7</command>, however not all facilities
	    are supported on
	    all operating systems.
	    How <command>syslog</command> will handle messages
	    sent to
	    this facility is described in the <command>syslog.conf</command> man
	    page. If you have a system which uses a very old version of <command>syslog</command> that
	    only uses two arguments to the <command>openlog()</command> function,
	    then this clause is silently ignored.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    On Windows machines syslog messages are directed to the EventViewer.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The <command>severity</command> clause works like <command>syslog</command>'s
	    "priorities", except that they can also be used if you are writing
	    straight to a file rather than using <command>syslog</command>.
	    Messages which are not at least of the severity level given will
	    not be selected for the channel; messages of higher severity
	    levels
	    will be accepted.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If you are using <command>syslog</command>, then the <command>syslog.conf</command> priorities
	    will also determine what eventually passes through. For example,
	    defining a channel facility and severity as <command>daemon</command> and <command>debug</command> but
	    only logging <command>daemon.warning</command> via <command>syslog.conf</command> will
	    cause messages of severity <command>info</command> and
	    <command>notice</command> to
	    be dropped. If the situation were reversed, with <command>named</command> writing
	    messages of only <command>warning</command> or higher,
	    then <command>syslogd</command> would
	    print all messages it received from the channel.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>stderr</command> destination clause
	    directs the
	    channel to the server's standard error stream.  This is intended
	    for
	    use when the server is running as a foreground process, for
	    example
	    when debugging a configuration.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The server can supply extensive debugging information when
	    it is in debugging mode. If the server's global debug level is
	    greater
	    than zero, then debugging mode will be active. The global debug
	    level is set either by starting the <command>named</command> server
	    with the <option>-d</option> flag followed by a positive integer,
	    or by running <command>rndc trace</command>.
	    The global debug level
	    can be set to zero, and debugging mode turned off, by running <command>rndc
notrace</command>. All debugging messages in the server have a debug
	    level, and higher debug levels give more detailed output. Channels
	    that specify a specific debug severity, for example:
	  </para>

<programlisting>channel specific_debug_level {
    file "foo";
    severity debug 3;
};
</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    will get debugging output of level 3 or less any time the
	    server is in debugging mode, regardless of the global debugging
	    level. Channels with <command>dynamic</command>
	    severity use the
	    server's global debug level to determine what messages to print.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    <command>print-time</command> can be set to
	    <userinput>yes</userinput>, <userinput>no</userinput>,
	    or a time format specifier, which may be one of
	    <userinput>local</userinput>, <userinput>iso8601</userinput> or
	    <userinput>iso8601-utc</userinput>.  If set to
	    <userinput>no</userinput>, then the date and time will
	    not be logged.  If set to <userinput>yes</userinput>
	    or <userinput>local</userinput>, the date and time are logged
	    in a human readable format, using the local time zone.
	    If set to <userinput>iso8601</userinput> the local time is
	    logged in ISO8601 format.  If set to
	    <userinput>iso8601-utc</userinput>, then the date and time
	    are logged in ISO8601 format, with time zone set to
	    UTC. The default is <userinput>no</userinput>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    <command>print-time</command> may
	    be specified for a <command>syslog</command> channel,
	    but it is usually
	    pointless since <command>syslog</command> also logs
	    the date and time.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If <command>print-category</command> is
	    requested, then the
	    category of the message will be logged as well. Finally, if <command>print-severity</command> is
	    on, then the severity level of the message will be logged. The <command>print-</command> options may
	    be used in any combination, and will always be printed in the
	    following
	    order: time, category, severity. Here is an example where all
	    three <command>print-</command> options
	    are on:
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    <computeroutput>28-Feb-2000 15:05:32.863 general: notice: running</computeroutput>
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    If <command>buffered</command> has been turned on the output
	    to files will not be flushed after each log entry.  By default
	    all log messages are flushed.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    There are four predefined channels that are used for
	    <command>named</command>'s default logging as follows.
	    If <command>named</command> is started with the
	    <option>-L</option> then a
	    fifth channel <command>default_logfile</command> is added.
	    How they are
	    used is described in <xref linkend="the_category_phrase"/>.
	  </para>

<programlisting>channel default_syslog {
    // send to syslog's daemon facility
    syslog daemon;
    // only send priority info and higher
    severity info;
};

channel default_debug {
    // write to named.run in the working directory
    // Note: stderr is used instead of "named.run" if
    // the server is started with the '-g' option.
    file "named.run";
    // log at the server's current debug level
    severity dynamic;
};

channel default_stderr {
    // writes to stderr
    stderr;
    // only send priority info and higher
    severity info;
};

channel null {
   // toss anything sent to this channel
   null;
};

channel default_logfile {
    // this channel is only present if named is
    // started with the -L option, whose argument
    // provides the file name
    file "...";
    // log at the server's current debug level
    severity dynamic;
};
</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    The <command>default_debug</command> channel has the
	    special
	    property that it only produces output when the server's debug
	    level is
	    nonzero.  It normally writes to a file called <filename>named.run</filename>
	    in the server's working directory.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    For security reasons, when the <option>-u</option>
	    command line option is used, the <filename>named.run</filename> file
	    is created only after <command>named</command> has
	    changed to the
	    new UID, and any debug output generated while <command>named</command> is
	    starting up and still running as root is discarded.  If you need
	    to capture this output, you must run the server with the <option>-L</option>
	    option to specify a default logfile, or the <option>-g</option>
	    option to log to standard error which you can redirect to a file.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Once a channel is defined, it cannot be redefined. Thus you
	    cannot alter the built-in channels directly, but you can modify
	    the default logging by pointing categories at channels you have
	    defined.
	  </para>
	</section>

	<section xml:id="the_category_phrase"><info><title>The <command>category</command> Phrase</title></info>

	  <para>
	    There are many categories, so you can send the logs you want
	    to see wherever you want, without seeing logs you don't want. If
	    you don't specify a list of channels for a category, then log
	    messages
	    in that category will be sent to the <command>default</command> category
	    instead. If you don't specify a default category, the following
	    "default default" is used:
	  </para>

<programlisting>category default { default_syslog; default_debug; };
</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    If you start <command>named</command> with the
	    <option>-L</option> option then the default category is:
	  </para>

<programlisting>category default { default_logfile; default_debug; };
</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    As an example, let's say you want to log security events to
	    a file, but you also want keep the default logging behavior. You'd
	    specify the following:
	  </para>

<programlisting>channel my_security_channel {
    file "my_security_file";
    severity info;
};
category security {
    my_security_channel;
    default_syslog;
    default_debug;
};</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    To discard all messages in a category, specify the <command>null</command> channel:
	  </para>

<programlisting>category xfer-out { null; };
category notify { null; };
</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    Following are the available categories and brief descriptions
	    of the types of log information they contain. More
	    categories may be added in future <acronym>BIND</acronym> releases.
	  </para>

	</section>
	<section xml:id="query_errors"><info><title>The <command>query-errors</command> Category</title></info>
	  <para>
	    The <command>query-errors</command> category is
	    specifically intended for debugging purposes: To identify
	    why and how specific queries result in responses which
	    indicate an error.
	    Messages of this category are therefore only logged
	    with <command>debug</command> levels.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    At the debug levels of 1 or higher, each response with the
	    rcode of SERVFAIL is logged as follows:
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    <computeroutput>client 127.0.0.1#61502: query failed (SERVFAIL) for www.example.com/IN/AAAA at query.c:3880</computeroutput>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    This means an error resulting in SERVFAIL was
	    detected at line 3880 of source file
	    <filename>query.c</filename>.
	    Log messages of this level will particularly
	    help identify the cause of SERVFAIL for an
	    authoritative server.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    At the debug levels of 2 or higher, detailed context
	    information of recursive resolutions that resulted in
	    SERVFAIL is logged.
	    The log message will look like as follows:
	  </para>
	  <para>
<!-- NOTE: newlines and some spaces added so this would fit on page -->
	    <programlisting>

	    SERVFAIL was determined at line 2970 of source file
	    <filename>resolver.c</filename>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The following part shows the detected final result and the
	    latest result of DNSSEC validation.
	    The latter is always success when no validation attempt
	    is made.
	    In this example, this query resulted in SERVFAIL probably
	    because all name servers are down or unreachable, leading
	    to a timeout in 30 seconds.
	    DNSSEC validation was probably not attempted.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The last part enclosed in square brackets shows statistics
	    information collected for this particular resolution
	    attempt.
	    The <varname>domain</varname> field shows the deepest zone

		<para>
		  Allows multiple views to share a single cache
		  database.
		  Each view has its own cache database by default, but
		  if multiple views have the same operational policy
		  for name resolution and caching, those views can
		  share a single cache to save memory and possibly
		  improve resolution efficiency by using this option.
		</para>

		<para>
		  The <command>attach-cache</command> option
		  may also be specified in <command>view</command>
		  statements, in which case it overrides the
		  global <command>attach-cache</command> option.
		</para>

		<para>
		  The <replaceable>cache_name</replaceable> specifies
		  the cache to be shared.
		  When the <command>named</command> server configures
		  views which are supposed to share a cache, it
		  creates a cache with the specified name for the
		  first view of these sharing views.
		  The rest of the views will simply refer to the
		  already created cache.
		</para>

		<para>
		  One common configuration to share a cache would be to
		  allow all views to share a single cache.
		  This can be done by specifying
		  the <command>attach-cache</command> as a global
		  option with an arbitrary name.
		</para>

		<para>
		  Another possible operation is to allow a subset of
		  all views to share a cache while the others to
		  retain their own caches.
		  For example, if there are three views A, B, and C,
		  and only A and B should share a cache, specify the
		  <command>attach-cache</command> option as a view A (or
		  B)'s option, referring to the other view name:
		</para>

<programlisting>
  view "A" {
    // this view has its own cache
    ...
  };
  view "B" {
    // this view refers to A's cache
    attach-cache "A";
  };
  view "C" {
    // this view has its own cache
    ...
  };
</programlisting>

		<para>
		  Views that share a cache must have the same policy
		  on configurable parameters that may affect caching.
		  The current implementation requires the following
		  configurable options be consistent among these
		  views:
		  <command>check-names</command>,
		  <command>cleaning-interval</command>,
		  <command>dnssec-accept-expired</command>,
		  <command>dnssec-validation</command>,
		  <command>max-cache-ttl</command>,
		  <command>max-ncache-ttl</command>,
		  <command>max-stale-ttl</command>,
		  <command>max-cache-size</command>, and
		  <command>min-cache-ttl</command>,
		  <command>min-ncache-ttl</command>,
		  <command>zero-no-soa-ttl</command>.
		</para>

		<para>
		  Note that there may be other parameters that may
		  cause confusion if they are inconsistent for
		  different views that share a single cache.
		  For example, if these views define different sets of
		  forwarders that can return different answers for the
		  same question, sharing the answer does not make
		  sense or could even be harmful.
		  It is administrator's responsibility to ensure
		  configuration differences in different views do
		  not cause disruption with a shared cache.

		<para>
		  This can result in slightly smaller responses: if

		  that the case of the query name exactly matches the

	  <para>
	    The interfaces and ports that the server will answer queries

	    an optional port and an <varname>address_match_list</varname>
	    of IPv4 addresses.  (IPv6 addresses are ignored, with a

	    The server will listen on all interfaces allowed by the address

	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Multiple <command>listen-on</command> statements are

	    For example,
	  </para>

<programlisting>listen-on { 5.6.7.8; };
listen-on port 1234 { !1.2.3.4; 1.2/16; };
</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    will enable the name server on port 53 for the IP address
	    5.6.7.8, and on port 1234 of an address on the machine in net
	    1.2 that is not 1.2.3.4.

	  <para>
	    If no <command>listen-on</command> is specified, the

	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>listen-on-v6</command> option is used to
	    specify the interfaces and the ports on which the server will

	  </para>

	  <para>
	    When <programlisting>{ any; }</programlisting> is
	    specified
	    as the <varname>address_match_list</varname> for the
	    <command>listen-on-v6</command> option,
	    the server does not bind a separate socket to each IPv6 interface
	    address as it does for IPv4 if the operating system has enough API
	    support for IPv6 (specifically if it conforms to RFC 3493 and RFC
	    3542).
	    Instead, it listens on the IPv6 wildcard address.
	    If the system only has incomplete API support for IPv6, however,
	    the behavior is the same as that for IPv4.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    A list of particular IPv6 addresses can also be specified, in

	    regardless of whether the desired API is supported by the system.
	    IPv4 addresses specified in <command>listen-on-v6</command>
	    will be ignored, with a logged warning.

listen-on-v6 port 1234 { !2001:db8::/32; any; };
</programlisting>

	  <para>

	<section xml:id="query_address"><info><title>Query Address</title></info>

	  <para>
	    If the server doesn't know the answer to a question, it will
	    query other name servers. <command>query-source</command> specifies
	    the address and port used for such queries. For queries sent over
	    IPv6, there is a separate <command>query-source-v6</command> option.
	    If <command>address</command> is <command>*</command> (asterisk) or is omitted,
	    a wildcard IP address (<command>INADDR_ANY</command>)
	    will be used.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    If <command>port</command> is <command>*</command> or is omitted,
	    a random port number from a pre-configured
	    range is picked up and will be used for each query.
	    The port range(s) is that specified in
	    the <command>use-v4-udp-ports</command> (for IPv4)
	    and <command>use-v6-udp-ports</command> (for IPv6)
	    options, excluding the ranges specified in
	    the <command>avoid-v4-udp-ports</command>
	    and <command>avoid-v6-udp-ports</command> options, respectively.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The defaults of the <command>query-source</command> and
	    <command>query-source-v6</command> options
	    are:
	  </para>

<programlisting>query-source address * port *;
query-source-v6 address * port *;
</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    If <command>use-v4-udp-ports</command> or
	    <command>use-v6-udp-ports</command> is unspecified,
	    <command>named</command> will check if the operating
	    system provides a programming interface to retrieve the
	    system's default range for ephemeral ports.
	    If such an interface is available,
	    <command>named</command> will use the corresponding system
	    default range; otherwise, it will use its own defaults:
	 </para>

<programlisting>use-v4-udp-ports { range 1024 65535; };
use-v6-udp-ports { range 1024 65535; };
</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    Note: make sure the ranges be sufficiently large for
	    security.  A desirable size depends on various parameters,
	    but we generally recommend it contain at least 16384 ports
	    (14 bits of entropy).
	    Note also that the system's default range when used may be
	    too small for this purpose, and that the range may even be
	    changed while <command>named</command> is running; the new
	    range will automatically be applied when <command>named</command>
	    is reloaded.
	    It is encouraged to
	    configure <command>use-v4-udp-ports</command> and
	    <command>use-v6-udp-ports</command> explicitly so that the
	    ranges are sufficiently large and are reasonably
	    independent from the ranges used by other applications.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Note: the operational configuration
	    where <command>named</command> runs may prohibit the use
	    of some ports.  For example, UNIX systems will not allow
	    <command>named</command> running without a root privilege
	    to use ports less than 1024.
	    If such ports are included in the specified (or detected)
	    set of query ports, the corresponding query attempts will
	    fail, resulting in resolution failures or delay.
	    It is therefore important to configure the set of ports
	    that can be safely used in the expected operational environment.

	  <para>
	    The defaults of the <command>avoid-v4-udp-ports</command> and

		<para>
		  Zone transfers can be sent using two different formats,

		  <command>many-answers</command>.
		  The <command>transfer-format</command> option is used
		  on the master server to determine which format it sends.
		  <command>one-answer</command> uses one DNS message per
		  resource record transferred.
		  <command>many-answers</command> packs as many resource
		  records as possible into a message.
		  <command>many-answers</command> is more efficient, but is

		<para>
		  The maximum amount of memory to use for the
		  server's cache, in bytes or % of total physical memory.
		  When the amount of data in the cache
		  reaches this limit, the server will cause records to
		  expire prematurely based on an LRU based strategy so
		  that the limit is not exceeded.
		  The keyword <userinput>unlimited</userinput>,
		  or the value 0, will place no limit on cache size;
		  records will be purged from the cache only when their
		  TTLs expire.
		  Any positive values less than 2MB will be ignored
		  and reset to 2MB.
		  In a server with multiple views, the limit applies
		  separately to the cache of each view.
		  The default is <userinput>90%</userinput>.
		  On systems where detection of amount of physical
		  memory is not supported values represented as %
		  fall back to unlimited.
		  Note that the detection of physical memory is done only
		  once at startup, so <command>named</command> will not
		  adjust the cache size if the amount of physical memory
		  is changed during runtime.

	<section xml:id="the_sortlist_statement"><info><title>The <command>sortlist</command> Statement</title></info>

	  <para>
	    The response to a DNS query may consist of multiple resource
	    records (RRs) forming a resource record set (RRset).  The name
	    server will normally return the RRs within the RRset in an
	    indeterminate order (but see the <command>rrset-order</command>
	    statement in <xref linkend="rrset_ordering"/>).  The client
	    resolver code should rearrange the RRs as appropriate, that is,
	    using any addresses on the local net in preference to other
	    addresses.  However, not all resolvers can do this or are
	    correctly configured.  When a client is using a local server,
	    the sorting can be performed in the server, based on the
	    client's address. This only requires configuring the name
	    servers, not all the clients.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>sortlist</command> statement (see below) takes an
	    <command>address_match_list</command> and interprets it in a
	    special way.  Each top level statement in the
	    <command>sortlist</command> must itself be an explicit
	    <command>address_match_list</command> with one or two elements.
	    The first element (which may be an IP address, an IP prefix, an
	    ACL name or a nested <command>address_match_list</command>) of
	    each top level list is checked against the source address of
	    the query until a match is found.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Once the source address of the query has been matched, if the
	    top level statement contains only one element, the actual
	    primitive element that matched the source address is used to
	    select the address in the response to move to the beginning of
	    the response. If the statement is a list of two elements, then
	    the second element is interpreted as a topology preference
	    list.  Each top level element is assigned a distance and the
	    address in the response with the minimum distance is moved to
	    the beginning of the response.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    In the following example, any queries received from any of the
	    addresses of the host itself will get responses preferring
	    addresses on any of the locally connected networks. Next most
	    preferred are addresses on the 192.168.1/24 network, and after
	    that either the 192.168.2/24 or 192.168.3/24 network with no
	    preference shown between these two networks. Queries received
	    from a host on the 192.168.1/24 network will prefer other
	    addresses on that network to the 192.168.2/24 and 192.168.3/24
	    networks. Queries received from a host on the 192.168.4/24 or
	    the 192.168.5/24 network will only prefer other addresses on
	    their directly connected networks.

	    The following example will give reasonable behavior for the
	    local host and hosts on directly connected networks. It is
	    similar to the behavior of the address sort in
	    <acronym>BIND</acronym> 4.9.x. Responses sent to queries from
	    the local host will favor any of the directly connected
	    networks. Responses sent to queries from any other hosts on a
	    directly connected network will prefer addresses on that same
	    network.  Responses to other queries will not be sorted.

	<section xml:id="content_filtering"><info><title>Content Filtering</title></info>

	  <para>
	    <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 provides the ability to filter
	    out DNS responses from external DNS servers containing
	    certain types of data in the answer section.
	    Specifically, it can reject address (A or AAAA) records if
	    the corresponding IPv4 or IPv6 addresses match the given
	    <varname>address_match_list</varname> of the
	    <command>deny-answer-addresses</command> option.
	    It can also reject CNAME or DNAME records if the "alias"
	    name (i.e., the CNAME alias or the substituted query name
	    due to DNAME) matches the
	    given <varname>namelist</varname> of the
	    <command>deny-answer-aliases</command> option, where
	    "match" means the alias name is a subdomain of one of
	    the <varname>name_list</varname> elements.
	    If the optional <varname>namelist</varname> is specified
	    with <command>except-from</command>, records whose query name
	    matches the list will be accepted regardless of the filter
	    setting.
	    Likewise, if the alias name is a subdomain of the
	    corresponding zone, the <command>deny-answer-aliases</command>
	    filter will not apply;
	    for example, even if "example.com" is specified for
	    <command>deny-answer-aliases</command>,
	  </para>
<programlisting>www.example.com. CNAME xxx.example.com.</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    returned by an "example.com" server will be accepted.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    In the <varname>address_match_list</varname> of the
	    <command>deny-answer-addresses</command> option, only
	    <varname>ip_addr</varname>
	    and <varname>ip_prefix</varname>
	    are meaningful;
	    any <varname>key_id</varname> will be silently ignored.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    If a response message is rejected due to the filtering,
	    the entire message is discarded without being cached, and
	    a SERVFAIL error will be returned to the client.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    This filtering is intended to prevent "DNS rebinding attacks," in
	    which an attacker, in response to a query for a domain name the
	    attacker controls, returns an IP address within your own network or
	    an alias name within your own domain.
	    A naive web browser or script could then serve as an
	    unintended proxy, allowing the attacker
	    to get access to an internal node of your local network
	    that couldn't be externally accessed otherwise.
	    See the paper available at
	    <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1315245.1315298">
	    http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1315245.1315298
	    </link>
	    for more details about the attacks.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    For example, if you own a domain named "example.net" and
	    your internal network uses an IPv4 prefix 192.0.2.0/24,
	    you might specify the following rules:
	  </para>

<programlisting>deny-answer-addresses { 192.0.2.0/24; } except-from { "example.net"; };
deny-answer-aliases { "example.net"; };
</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    If an external attacker lets a web browser in your local
	    network look up an IPv4 address of "attacker.example.com",
	    the attacker's DNS server would return a response like this:
	  </para>

<programlisting>attacker.example.com. A 192.0.2.1</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    in the answer section.
	    Since the rdata of this record (the IPv4 address) matches
	    the specified prefix 192.0.2.0/24, this response will be
	    ignored.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    On the other hand, if the browser looks up a legitimate
	    internal web server "www.example.net" and the
	    following response is returned to
	    the <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 server
	  </para>

<programlisting>www.example.net. A 192.0.2.2</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    it will be accepted since the owner name "www.example.net"
	    matches the <command>except-from</command> element,
	    "example.net".
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Note that this is not really an attack on the DNS per se.
	    In fact, there is nothing wrong for an "external" name to
	    be mapped to your "internal" IP address or domain name
	    from the DNS point of view.
	    It might actually be provided for a legitimate purpose,
	    such as for debugging.
	    As long as the mapping is provided by the correct owner,
	    it is not possible or does not make sense to detect
	    whether the intent of the mapping is legitimate or not
	    within the DNS.
	    The "rebinding" attack must primarily be protected at the
	    application that uses the DNS.
	    For a large site, however, it may be difficult to protect
	    all possible applications at once.
	    This filtering feature is provided only to help such an
	    operational environment;
	    it is generally discouraged to turn it on unless you are
	    very sure you have no other choice and the attack is a
	    real threat for your applications.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Care should be particularly taken if you want to use this
	    option for addresses within 127.0.0.0/8.
	    These addresses are obviously "internal", but many
	    applications conventionally rely on a DNS mapping from
	    some name to such an address.
	    Filtering out DNS records containing this address
	    spuriously can break such applications.

	<section xml:id="rpz"><info><title>Response Policy Zone (RPZ) Rewriting</title></info>

	  <para>
	    <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 includes a limited
	    mechanism to modify DNS responses for requests
	    analogous to email anti-spam DNS blacklists.
	    Responses can be changed to deny the existence of domains (NXDOMAIN),
	    deny the existence of IP addresses for domains (NODATA),
	    or contain other IP addresses or data.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Response policy zones are named in the
	    <command>response-policy</command> option for the view or among the
	    global options if there is no response-policy option for the view.
	    Response policy zones are ordinary DNS zones containing RRsets
	    that can be queried normally if allowed.
	    It is usually best to restrict those queries with something like
	    <command>allow-query { localhost; };</command>.
	    Note that zones using <command>masterfile-format map</command>
	    cannot be used as policy zones.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    A <command>response-policy</command> option can support
	    multiple policy zones.  To maximize performance, a radix
	    tree is used to quickly identify response policy zones
	    containing triggers that match the current query.  This
	    imposes an upper limit of 64 on the number of policy zones
	    in a single <command>response-policy</command> option; more
	    than that is a configuration error.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Rules encoded in response policy zones are processed after
	    <link linkend="access_control">Access Control Lists
	    (ACLs)</link>.  All queries from clients which are not
	    permitted access to the resolver will be answered with a
	    status code of REFUSED, regardless of configured RPZ rules.

	  <para>
	    Five policy triggers can be encoded in RPZ records.
	    <variablelist>
	      <varlistentry>
		<term><command>RPZ-CLIENT-IP</command></term>
		<listitem>
		  <para>
		    IP records are triggered by the IP address of the
		    DNS client.
		    Client IP address triggers are encoded in records that have
		    owner names that are subdomains of
		    <command>rpz-client-ip</command> relativized to the
		    policy zone origin name
		    and encode an address or address block.
		    IPv4 addresses are represented as
		    <userinput>prefixlength.B4.B3.B2.B1.rpz-client-ip</userinput>.
		    The IPv4 prefix length must be between 1 and 32.
		    All four bytes, B4, B3, B2, and B1, must be present.
		    B4 is the decimal value of the least significant byte of the
		    IPv4 address as in IN-ADDR.ARPA.
		  </para>

		  <para>
		    IPv6 addresses are encoded in a format similar
		    to the standard IPv6 text representation,
		    <userinput>prefixlength.W8.W7.W6.W5.W4.W3.W2.W1.rpz-client-ip</userinput>.
		    Each of W8,...,W1 is a one to four digit hexadecimal number
		    representing 16 bits of the IPv6 address as in the standard
		    text representation of IPv6 addresses, but reversed as in
		    IP6.ARPA. (Note that this representation of IPv6
		    address is different from IP6.ARPA where each hex
		    digit occupies a label.)
		    All 8 words must be present except when one set of consecutive
		    zero words is replaced with <userinput>.zz.</userinput>
		    analogous to double colons (::) in standard IPv6 text
		    encodings.
		    The IPv6 prefix length must be between 1 and 128.

	      <varlistentry>
		<term><command>RPZ-IP</command></term>
		<listitem>
		  <para>
		    IP triggers are IP addresses in an

	      <varlistentry>
		<term><command>RPZ-NSDNAME</command></term>

		    NSDNAME triggers match names of authoritative servers
		    for the query name, a parent of the query name, a CNAME for
		    query name, or a parent of a CNAME.
		    They are encoded as subdomains of
		    <command>rpz-nsdname</command> relativized
		    to the RPZ origin name.
		    NSIP triggers match IP addresses in A and
		    AAAA RRsets for domains that can be checked against NSDNAME
		    policy records.
		    The <command>nsdname-enable</command> phrase turns NSDNAME
		    triggers off or on for a single policy zone or all
		    zones.

	      </varlistentry>

	      <varlistentry>
		<term><command>RPZ-NSIP</command></term>
		<listitem>
		  <para>
		    NSIP triggers match the IP addresses of authoritative
		    servers.  They are enncoded like IP triggers, except as
		    subdomains of <command>rpz-nsip</command>.
		    NSDNAME and NSIP triggers are checked only for names with at
		    least <command>min-ns-dots</command> dots.
		    The default value of <command>min-ns-dots</command> is
		    1, to exclude top level domains.
		    The <command>nsip-enable</command> phrase turns NSIP
		    triggers off or on for a single policy zone or all
		    zones.
		  </para>
		  <para>
		    If a name server's IP address is not yet known,
		    <command>named</command> will recursively look up
		    the IP address before applying an RPZ-NSIP rule.
		    This can cause a processing delay. To speed up
		    processing at the cost of precision, the
		    <command>nsip-wait-recurse</command> option
		    can be used: when set to <userinput>no</userinput>,
		    RPZ-NSIP rules will only be applied when a name
		    servers's IP address has already been looked up and
		    cached.  If a server's IP address is not in the
		    cache, then the RPZ-NSIP rule will be ignored,
		    but the address will be looked up in the
		    background, and the rule will be applied
		    to subsequent queries.  The default is
		    <userinput>yes</userinput>, meaning RPZ-NSIP
		    rules should always be applied even if an
		    address needs to be looked up first.

	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The query response is checked against all response policy zones,
	    so two or more policy records can be triggered by a response.
	    Because DNS responses are rewritten according to at most one
	    policy record, a single record encoding an action (other than
	    <command>DISABLED</command> actions) must be chosen.
	    Triggers or the records that encode them are chosen for the
	    rewriting in the following order:
	    <orderedlist inheritnum="ignore" continuation="restarts">
	      <listitem>Choose the triggered record in the zone that appears

	  <para>
	    When the processing of a response is restarted to resolve
	    DNAME or CNAME records and a policy record set has
	    not been triggered,
	    all response policy zones are again consulted for the
	    DNAME or CNAME names and addresses.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    RPZ record sets are any types of DNS record except
	    DNAME or DNSSEC that encode actions or responses to
	    individual queries.
	    Any of the policies can be used with any of the triggers.
	    For example, while the <command>TCP-only</command> policy is
	    commonly used with <command>client-IP</command> triggers,
	    it can be used with any type of trigger to force the use of

	  <para>
	    By default, the actions encoded in a response policy zone
	    are applied only to queries that ask for recursion (RD=1).
	    That default can be changed for a single policy zone or
	    all response policy zones in a view
	    with a <command>recursive-only no</command> clause.
	    This feature is useful for serving the same zone files
	    both inside and outside an RFC 1918 cloud and using RPZ to
	    delete answers that would otherwise contain RFC 1918 values
	    on the externally visible name server or view.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Also by default, RPZ actions are applied only to DNS requests
	    that either do not request DNSSEC metadata (DO=0) or when no
	    DNSSEC records are available for request name in the original
	    zone (not the response policy zone).  This default can be
	    changed for all response policy zones in a view with a
	    <command>break-dnssec yes</command> clause.  In that case, RPZ
	    actions are applied regardless of DNSSEC.  The name of the
	    clause option reflects the fact that results rewritten by RPZ
	    actions cannot verify.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    No DNS records are needed for a QNAME or Client-IP trigger.
	    The name or IP address itself is sufficient,
	    so in principle the query name need not be recursively resolved.
	    However, not resolving the requested
	    name can leak the fact that response policy rewriting is in use
	    and that the name is listed in a policy zone to operators of
	    servers for listed names.  To prevent that information leak, by
	    default any recursion needed for a request is done before any
	    policy triggers are considered.  Because listed domains often
	    have slow authoritative servers, this behavior can cost
	    significant time.
	    The <command>qname-wait-recurse yes</command> option
	    overrides the default and enables that behavior
	    when recursion cannot change a non-error response.
	    The option does not affect QNAME or client-IP triggers
	    in policy zones listed
	    after other zones containing IP, NSIP and NSDNAME triggers, because
	    those may depend on the A, AAAA, and NS records that would be
	    found during recursive resolution.  It also does not affect
	    DNSSEC requests (DO=1) unless <command>break-dnssec yes</command>
	    is in use, because the response would depend on whether or not
	    RRSIG records were found during resolution.
	    Using this option can cause error responses such as SERVFAIL to
	    appear to be rewritten, since no recursion is being done to
	    discover problems at the authoritative server.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>dnsrps-enable yes</command> option turns on
	    the DNS Rsponse Policy Service (DNSRPS) interface, if it has been

	    <command>configure --enable-dnsrps</command>.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>dnsrps-options</command> block provides additional
	    RPZ configuration settings, which are passed through to the
	    DNSRPS provider library.
	    Multiple DNSRPS settings in an <command>dnsrps-options</command>
	    string should be separated with semi-colons.
	    The DNSRPS provider, librpz, is passed a configuration string
	    consisting of the <command>dnsrps-options</command> text,
	    concatenated with settings derived from the
	    <command>response-policy</command> statement.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Note: The <command>dnsrps-options</command> text should only include
	    configuration settings that are specific to the DNSRPS
	    provider.  For example, the DNSRPS provider from
	    Farsight Security takes options such as
	    <command>dnsrpzd-conf</command>,
	    <command>dnsrpzd-sock</command>, and
	    <command>dnzrpzd-args</command> (for details of these options,
	    see the <command>librpz</command> documentation).
	    Other RPZ configuration settings could be included in
	    <command>dnsrps-options</command>
	    as well, but if <command>named</command> were switched
	    back to traditional RPZ by setting
	    <command>dnsrps-enable</command> to "no", those options would
	    be ignored.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The TTL of a record modified by RPZ policies is set from the
	    TTL of the relevant record in policy zone.  It is then limited
	    to a maximum value.
	    The <command>max-policy-ttl</command> clause changes the
	    maximum seconds from its default of 5.
	    For convenience, TTL-style time unit suffixes may be
	    used to specify the value.

	  <para>
	    RPZ can affect server performance.
	    Each configured response policy zone requires the server to
	    perform one to four additional database lookups before a
	    query can be answered.
	    For example, a DNS server with four policy zones, each with all
	    four kinds of response triggers, QNAME, IP, NSIP, and
	    NSDNAME, requires a total of 17 times as many database
	    lookups as a similar DNS server with no response policy zones.
	    A <acronym>BIND9</acronym> server with adequate memory and one
	    response policy zone with QNAME and IP triggers might achieve a
	    maximum queries-per-second rate about 20% lower.
	    A server with four response policy zones with QNAME and IP
	    triggers might have a maximum QPS rate about 50% lower.

	  <para>
	    The <command>add-soa</command> option controls whether the RPZ's
	    SOA record is added to the additional section for traceback
	    of changes from this zone or not.  This can be set at the
	    individual policy zone level or at the response-policy level.
	    The default is <literal>yes</literal>.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Updates to RPZ zones are processed asynchronously; if there

	    If an update to a RPZ zone (for example, via IXFR) happens less

	<section xml:id="rrl"><info><title>Response Rate Limiting</title></info>

	  <para>
	    Excessive almost identical UDP <emphasis>responses</emphasis>
	    can be controlled by configuring a
	    <command>rate-limit</command> clause in an
	    <command>options</command> or <command>view</command> statement.
	    This mechanism keeps authoritative BIND 9 from being used
	    in amplifying reflection denial of service (DoS) attacks.
	    Short truncated (TC=1) responses can be sent to provide
	    rate-limited responses to legitimate clients within
	    a range of forged, attacked IP addresses.
	    Legitimate clients react to dropped or truncated response
	    by retrying with UDP or with TCP respectively.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    This mechanism is intended for authoritative DNS servers.
	    It can be used on recursive servers but can slow
	    applications such as SMTP servers (mail receivers) and
	    HTTP clients (web browsers) that repeatedly request the
	    same domains.
	    When possible, closing "open" recursive servers is better.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Response rate limiting uses a "credit" or "token bucket" scheme.
	    Each combination of identical response and client
	    has a conceptual account that earns a specified number
	    of credits every second.
	    A prospective response debits its account by one.
	    Responses are dropped or truncated
	    while the account is negative.
	    Responses are tracked within a rolling window of time
	    which defaults to 15 seconds, but can be configured with
	    the <command>window</command> option to any value from
	    1 to 3600 seconds (1 hour).
	    The account cannot become more positive than
	    the per-second limit
	    or more negative than <command>window</command>
	    times the per-second limit.
	    When the specified number of credits for a class of
	    responses is set to 0, those responses are not rate limited.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The notions of "identical response" and "DNS client"
	    for rate limiting are not simplistic.
	    All responses to an address block are counted as if to a
	    single client.
	    The prefix lengths of addresses blocks are
	    specified with <command>ipv4-prefix-length</command> (default 24)
	    and <command>ipv6-prefix-length</command> (default 56).
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    All non-empty responses for a valid domain name (qname)
	    and record type (qtype) are identical and have a limit specified
	    with <command>responses-per-second</command>
	    (default 0 or no limit).
	    All empty (NODATA) responses for a valid domain,
	    regardless of query type, are identical.
	    Responses in the NODATA class are limited by
	    <command>nodata-per-second</command>
	    (default <command>responses-per-second</command>).
	    Requests for any and all undefined subdomains of a given
	    valid domain result in NXDOMAIN errors, and are identical
	    regardless of query type.
	    They are limited by <command>nxdomains-per-second</command>
	    (default <command>responses-per-second</command>).
	    This controls some attacks using random names, but
	    can be relaxed or turned off (set to 0)
	    on servers that expect many legitimate
	    NXDOMAIN responses, such as from anti-spam blacklists.
	    Referrals or delegations to the server of a given
	    domain are identical and are limited by
	    <command>referrals-per-second</command>
	    (default <command>responses-per-second</command>).
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Responses generated from local wildcards are counted and limited
	    as if they were for the parent domain name.
	    This controls flooding using random.wild.example.com.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    All requests that result in DNS errors other
	    than NXDOMAIN, such as SERVFAIL and FORMERR, are identical
	    regardless of requested name (qname) or record type (qtype).
	    This controls attacks using invalid requests or distant,
	    broken authoritative servers.
	    By default the limit on errors is the same as the
	    <command>responses-per-second</command> value,
	    but it can be set separately with
	    <command>errors-per-second</command>.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Many attacks using DNS involve UDP requests with forged source
	    addresses.
	    Rate limiting prevents the use of BIND 9 to flood a network
	    with responses to requests with forged source addresses,
	    but could let a third party block responses to legitimate requests.
	    There is a mechanism that can answer some legitimate
	    requests from a client whose address is being forged in a flood.
	    Setting <command>slip</command> to 2 (its default) causes every
	    other UDP request to be answered with a small truncated (TC=1)
	    response.
	    The small size and reduced frequency, and so lack of
	    amplification, of "slipped" responses make them unattractive
	    for reflection DoS attacks.
	    <command>slip</command> must be between 0 and 10.
	    A value of 0 does not "slip":
	    no truncated responses are sent due to rate limiting,
	    all responses are dropped.
	    A value of 1 causes every response to slip;
	    values between 2 and 10 cause every n'th response to slip.
	    Some error responses including REFUSED and SERVFAIL
	    cannot be replaced with truncated responses and are instead
	    leaked at the <command>slip</command> rate.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    (NOTE: Dropped responses from an authoritative server may
	    reduce the difficulty of a third party successfully forging
	    a response to a recursive resolver. The best security
	    against forged responses is for authoritative operators
	    to sign their zones using DNSSEC and for resolver operators
	    to validate the responses. When this is not an option,
	    operators who are more concerned with response integrity
	    than with flood mitigation may consider setting
	    <command>slip</command> to 1, causing all rate-limited
	    responses to be truncated rather than dropped.  This reduces
	    the effectiveness of rate-limiting against reflection attacks.)
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    When the approximate query per second rate exceeds
	    the <command>qps-scale</command> value,
	    then the <command>responses-per-second</command>,
	    <command>errors-per-second</command>,
	    <command>nxdomains-per-second</command> and
	    <command>all-per-second</command> values are reduced by the
	    ratio of the current rate to the <command>qps-scale</command> value.
	    This feature can tighten defenses during attacks.
	    For example, with
	    <command>qps-scale 250; responses-per-second 20;</command> and
	    a total query rate of 1000 queries/second for all queries from
	    all DNS clients including via TCP,
	    then the effective responses/second limit changes to
	    (250/1000)*20 or 5.
	    Responses sent via TCP are not limited
	    but are counted to compute the query per second rate.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Communities of DNS clients can be given their own parameters or no
	    rate limiting by putting
	    <command>rate-limit</command> statements in <command>view</command>
	    statements instead of the global <command>option</command>
	    statement.
	    A <command>rate-limit</command> statement in a view replaces,
	    rather than supplementing, a <command>rate-limit</command>
	    statement among the main options.
	    DNS clients within a view can be exempted from rate limits
	    with the <command>exempt-clients</command> clause.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    UDP responses of all kinds can be limited with the
	    <command>all-per-second</command> phrase.  This rate
	    limiting is unlike the rate limiting provided by
	    <command>responses-per-second</command>,
	    <command>errors-per-second</command>, and
	    <command>nxdomains-per-second</command> on a DNS server
	    which are often invisible to the victim of a DNS
	    reflection attack.  Unless the forged requests of the
	    attack are the same as the legitimate requests of the
	    victim, the victim's requests are not affected.  Responses
	    affected by an <command>all-per-second</command> limit
	    are always dropped; the <command>slip</command> value
	    has no effect.  An <command>all-per-second</command>
	    limit should be at least 4 times as large as the other
	    limits, because single DNS clients often send bursts
	    of legitimate requests.  For example, the receipt of a
	    single mail message can prompt requests from an SMTP
	    server for NS, PTR, A, and AAAA records as the incoming
	    SMTP/TCP/IP connection is considered.  The SMTP server
	    can need additional NS, A, AAAA, MX, TXT, and SPF records
	    as it considers the STMP <command>Mail From</command>
	    command.  Web browsers often repeatedly resolve the
	    same names that are repeated in HTML &lt;IMG&gt; tags
	    in a page.  <command>all-per-second</command> is similar
	    to the rate limiting offered by firewalls but often
	    inferior.  Attacks that justify ignoring the contents
	    of DNS responses are likely to be attacks on the DNS
	    server itself.  They usually should be discarded before
	    the DNS server spends resources make TCP connections
	    or parsing DNS requests, but that rate limiting must
	    be done before the DNS server sees the requests.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The maximum size of the table used to track requests and
	    rate limit responses is set with <command>max-table-size</command>.
	    Each entry in the table is between 40 and 80 bytes.
	    The table needs approximately as many entries as the number
	    of requests received per second.
	    The default is 20,000.
	    To reduce the cold start of growing the table,
	    <command>min-table-size</command> (default 500)
	    can set the minimum table size.

	  </para>
	  <para>
	    With a redirect zone (<command>zone "." { type redirect; };</command>), the

	    also be set in the zone block and, if set there, it will
	    override the global or view setting for that zone.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    IXFR requests to servers that do not support IXFR will
	    automatically
	    fall back to AXFR.  Therefore, there is no need to manually list
	    which servers support IXFR and which ones do not; the global
	    default
	    of <command>yes</command> should always work.
	    The purpose of the <command>provide-ixfr</command> and
	    <command>request-ixfr</command> clauses is
	    to make it possible to disable the use of IXFR even when both
	    master
	    and slave claim to support it, for example if one of the servers
	    is buggy and crashes or corrupts data when IXFR is used.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>request-expire</command> clause determines
	    whether the local server, when acting as a slave, will
	    request the EDNS EXPIRE value.  The EDNS EXPIRE value
	    indicates the remaining time before the zone data will
	    expire and need to be be refreshed.  This is used
	    when a secondary server transfers a zone from another
	    secondary server; when transferring from the primary, the
	    expiration timer is set from the EXPIRE field of the SOA
	    record instead.
	    The default is <command>yes</command>.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>edns</command> clause determines whether
	    the local server will attempt to use EDNS when communicating
	    with the remote server.  The default is <command>yes</command>.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>edns-udp-size</command> option sets the
	    EDNS UDP size that is advertised by <command>named</command>
	    when querying the remote server.  Valid values are 512
	    to 4096 bytes (values outside this range will be silently
	    adjusted to the nearest value within it).  This option
	    is useful when you wish to advertise a different value
	    to this server than the value you advertise globally,
	    for example, when there is a firewall at the remote
	    site that is blocking large replies. (Note: Currently,
	    this sets a single UDP size for all packets sent to the
	    server; <command>named</command> will not deviate from
	    this value.  This differs from the behavior of
	    <command>edns-udp-size</command> in <command>options</command>
	    or <command>view</command> statements, where it specifies
	    a maximum value. The <command>server</command> statement
	    behavior may be brought into conformance with the
	    <command>options/view</command> behavior in future releases.)
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>edns-version</command> option sets the
	    maximum EDNS VERSION that will be sent to the server(s)
	    by the resolver.  The actual EDNS version sent is still
	    subject to normal EDNS version negotiation rules (see
	    RFC 6891), the maximum EDNS version supported by the
	    server, and any other heuristics that indicate that a
	    lower version should be sent.  This option is intended
	    to be used when a remote server reacts badly to a given
	    EDNS version or higher; it should be set to the highest
	    version the remote server is known to support.  Valid
	    values are 0 to 255; higher values will be silently
	    adjusted.  This option will not be needed until higher
	    EDNS versions than 0 are in use.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>max-udp-size</command> option sets the
	    maximum EDNS UDP message size <command>named</command>
	    will send.  Valid values are 512 to 4096 bytes (values
	    outside this range will be silently adjusted).  This
	    option is useful when you know that there is a firewall
	    that is blocking large replies from <command>named</command>.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>padding</command> option adds EDNS Padding
	    options to outgoing messages, increasing the packet size to
	    a multiple of the specified block size. Valid block sizes
	    range from 0 (the default, which disables the use of
	    EDNS Padding) to 512 bytes.  Larger values will be reduced
	    to 512, with a logged warning.
	    Note: This option is not currently compatible with no TSIG
	    or SIG(0), as the EDNS OPT record containing the padding
	    would have to be added to the packet after it had already
	    been signed.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>tcp-only</command> option sets the transport
	    protocol to TCP. The default is to use the UDP transport
	    and to fallback on TCP only when a truncated response
	    is received.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>tcp-keepalive</command> option adds EDNS
	    TCP keepalive to messages sent over TCP. Note currently
	    idle timeouts in responses are ignored.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The server supports two zone transfer methods. The first, <command>one-answer</command>,
	    uses one DNS message per resource record transferred. <command>many-answers</command> packs
	    as many resource records as possible into a message. <command>many-answers</command> is
	    more efficient, but is only known to be understood by <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9, <acronym>BIND</acronym>
	    8.x, and patched versions of <acronym>BIND</acronym>
	    4.9.5. You can specify which method
	    to use for a server with the <command>transfer-format</command> option.
	    If <command>transfer-format</command> is not
	    specified, the <command>transfer-format</command>
	    specified
	    by the <command>options</command> statement will be
	    used.
	  </para>

	  <para><command>transfers</command>
	    is used to limit the number of concurrent inbound zone
	    transfers from the specified server. If no
	    <command>transfers</command> clause is specified, the
	    limit is set according to the
	    <command>transfers-per-ns</command> option.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>keys</command> clause identifies a
	    <command>key_id</command> defined by the <command>key</command> statement,
	    to be used for transaction security (TSIG, <xref linkend="tsig"/>)
	    when talking to the remote server.
	    When a request is sent to the remote server, a request signature
	    will be generated using the key specified here and appended to the
	    message. A request originating from the remote server is not
	    required
	    to be signed by this key.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Only a single key per server is currently supported.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>transfer-source</command> and
	    <command>transfer-source-v6</command> clauses specify
	    the IPv4 and IPv6 source
	    address to be used for zone transfer with the remote server,
	    respectively.
	    For an IPv4 remote server, only <command>transfer-source</command> can
	    be specified.
	    Similarly, for an IPv6 remote server, only
	    <command>transfer-source-v6</command> can be
	    specified.
	    For more details, see the description of
	    <command>transfer-source</command> and

	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>notify-source</command> and
	    <command>notify-source-v6</command> clauses specify the
	    IPv4 and IPv6 source address to be used for notify
	    messages sent to remote servers, respectively.  For an
	    IPv4 remote server, only <command>notify-source</command>
	    can be specified.  Similarly, for an IPv6 remote server,
	    only <command>notify-source-v6</command> can be specified.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>query-source</command> and
	    <command>query-source-v6</command> clauses specify the
	    IPv4 and IPv6 source address to be used for queries
	    sent to remote servers, respectively.  For an IPv4
	    remote server, only <command>query-source</command> can
	    be specified.  Similarly, for an IPv6 remote server,
	    only <command>query-source-v6</command> can be specified.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>request-nsid</command> clause determines
	    whether the local server will add a NSID EDNS option
	    to requests sent to the server.  This overrides
	    <command>request-nsid</command> set at the view or
	    option level.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>send-cookie</command> clause determines
	    whether the local server will add a COOKIE EDNS option
	    to requests sent to the server.  This overrides
	    <command>send-cookie</command> set at the view or
	    option level.  The <command>named</command> server may
	    determine that COOKIE is not supported by the remote server
	    and not add a COOKIE EDNS option to requests.

	    Usage</title></info>

	<para>
	  The <command>statistics-channels</command> statement
	  declares communication channels to be used by system
	  administrators to get access to statistics information of
	  the name server.
	</para>

	<para>
	  This statement intends to be flexible to support multiple
	  communication protocols in the future, but currently only
	  HTTP access is supported.
	  It requires that BIND 9 be compiled with libxml2 and/or
	  json-c (also known as libjson0); the
	  <command>statistics-channels</command> statement is
	  still accepted even if it is built without the library,
	  but any HTTP access will fail with an error.
	</para>

	<para>
	  An <command>inet</command> control channel is a TCP socket
	  listening at the specified <command>ip_port</command> on the
	  specified <command>ip_addr</command>, which can be an IPv4 or IPv6
	  address.  An <command>ip_addr</command> of <literal>*</literal>
	  (asterisk) is
	  interpreted as the IPv4 wildcard address; connections will be
	  accepted on any of the system's IPv4 addresses.
	  To listen on the IPv6 wildcard address,
	  use an <command>ip_addr</command> of <literal>::</literal>.
	</para>

	<para>
	  If no port is specified, port 80 is used for HTTP channels.
	  The asterisk "<literal>*</literal>" cannot be used for
	  <command>ip_port</command>.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The attempt of opening a statistics channel is
	  restricted by the optional <command>allow</command> clause.
	  Connections to the statistics channel are permitted based on the
	  <command>address_match_list</command>.
	  If no <command>allow</command> clause is present,
	  <command>named</command> accepts connection
	  attempts from any address; since the statistics may
	  contain sensitive internal information, it is highly
	  recommended to restrict the source of connection requests
	  appropriately.
	</para>

	<para>
	  If no <command>statistics-channels</command> statement is present,
	  <command>named</command> will not open any communication channels.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The statistics are available in various formats and views
	  depending on the URI used to access them.  For example, if
	  the statistics channel is configured to listen on 127.0.0.1
	  port 8888, then the statistics are accessible in XML format at
	  <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://127.0.0.1:8888/">http://127.0.0.1:8888/</link> or

	  included which can format the XML statistics into tables
	  when viewed with a stylesheet-capable browser, and into
	  charts and graphs using the Google Charts API when using a
	  javascript-capable browser.
	</para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>trusted-keys</command> statement defines
	    DNSSEC security roots. DNSSEC is described in <xref linkend="DNSSEC"/>. A security root is defined when the
	    public key for a non-authoritative zone is known, but
	    cannot be securely obtained through DNS, either because
	    it is the DNS root zone or because its parent zone is
	    unsigned.  Once a key has been configured as a trusted
	    key, it is treated as if it had been validated and
	    proven secure. The resolver attempts DNSSEC validation
	    on all DNS data in subdomains of a security root.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    All keys (and corresponding zones) listed in
	    <command>trusted-keys</command> are deemed to exist regardless
	    of what parent zones say.  Similarly for all keys listed in
	    <command>trusted-keys</command> only those keys are
	    used to validate the DNSKEY RRset.  The parent's DS RRset
	    will not be used.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The <command>trusted-keys</command> statement can contain
	    multiple key entries, each consisting of the key's
	    domain name, flags, protocol, algorithm, and the Base64
	    representation of the key data.
	    Spaces, tabs, newlines and carriage returns are ignored
	    in the key data, so the configuration may be split up into
	    multiple lines.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    <command>trusted-keys</command> may be set at the top level
	    of <filename>named.conf</filename> or within a view.  If it is

	</section>
	<section xml:id="managed-keys"><info><title><command>managed-keys</command> Statement Definition
	    and Usage</title></info>

	  <para>
	    The <command>managed-keys</command> statement, like
	    <command>trusted-keys</command>, defines DNSSEC
	    security roots.  The difference is that
	    <command>managed-keys</command> can be kept up to date
	    automatically, without intervention from the resolver
	    operator.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Suppose, for example, that a zone's key-signing
	    key was compromised, and the zone owner had to revoke and
	    replace the key.  A resolver which had the old key in a
	    <command>trusted-keys</command> statement would be
	    unable to validate this zone any longer; it would
	    reply with a SERVFAIL response code.  This would
	    continue until the resolver operator had updated the
	    <command>trusted-keys</command> statement with the new key.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If, however, the zone were listed in a
	    <command>managed-keys</command> statement instead, then the
	    zone owner could add a "stand-by" key to the zone in advance.
	    <command>named</command> would store the stand-by key, and
	    when the original key was revoked, <command>named</command>
	    would be able to transition smoothly to the new key.  It would
	    also recognize that the old key had been revoked, and cease
	    using that key to validate answers, minimizing the damage that
	    the compromised key could do.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    A <command>managed-keys</command> statement contains a list of
	    the keys to be managed, along with information about how the
	    keys are to be initialized for the first time.  The only
	    initialization method currently supported is
	    <literal>initial-key</literal>.
	    This means the <command>managed-keys</command> statement must
	    contain a copy of the initializing key.  (Future releases may
	    allow keys to be initialized by other methods, eliminating this
	    requirement.)
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Consequently, a <command>managed-keys</command> statement
	    appears similar to a <command>trusted-keys</command>, differing
	    in the presence of the second field, containing the keyword
	    <literal>initial-key</literal>.  The difference is, whereas the
	    keys listed in a <command>trusted-keys</command> continue to be
	    trusted until they are removed from
	    <filename>named.conf</filename>, an initializing key listed
	    in a <command>managed-keys</command> statement is only trusted
	    <emphasis>once</emphasis>: for as long as it takes to load the
	    managed key database and start the RFC 5011 key maintenance
	    process.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The first time <command>named</command> runs with a managed key
	    configured in <filename>named.conf</filename>, it fetches the
	    DNSKEY RRset directly from the zone apex, and validates it
	    using the key specified in the <command>managed-keys</command>
	    statement.  If the DNSKEY RRset is validly signed, then it is
	    used as the basis for a new managed keys database.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    From that point on, whenever <command>named</command> runs, it
	    sees the <command>managed-keys</command> statement, checks to
	    make sure RFC 5011 key maintenance has already been initialized
	    for the specified domain, and if so, it simply moves on.  The
	    key specified in the <command>managed-keys</command>
	    statement is not used to validate answers; it has been
	    superseded by the key or keys stored in the managed keys database.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The next time <command>named</command> runs after a name
	    has been <emphasis>removed</emphasis> from the
	    <command>managed-keys</command> statement, the corresponding
	    zone will be removed from the managed keys database,
	    and RFC 5011 key maintenance will no longer be used for that
	    domain.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    In the current implementation, the managed keys database
	    is stored as a master-format zone file.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    On servers which do not use views, this file is named
	    <filename>managed-keys.bind</filename>.  When views are in
	    use, there will be a separate managed keys database for each
	    view; the filename will be the view name (or, if a view name
	    contains characters which would make it illegal as a filename,
	    a hash of the view name), followed by
	    the suffix <filename>.mkeys</filename>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    When the key database is changed, the zone is updated.
	    As with any other dynamic zone, changes will be written
	    into a journal file, e.g.,
	    <filename>managed-keys.bind.jnl</filename> or

	  <para>
	    The <command>view</command> statement is a powerful
	    feature
	    of <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 that lets a name server
	    answer a DNS query differently
	    depending on who is asking. It is particularly useful for
	    implementing
	    split DNS setups without having to run multiple servers.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Each <command>view</command> statement defines a view
	    of the
	    DNS namespace that will be seen by a subset of clients.  A client
	    matches
	    a view if its source IP address matches the
	    <varname>address_match_list</varname> of the view's
	    <command>match-clients</command> clause and its
	    destination IP address matches
	    the <varname>address_match_list</varname> of the
	    view's
	    <command>match-destinations</command> clause.  If not
	    specified, both
	    <command>match-clients</command> and <command>match-destinations</command>
	    default to matching all addresses.  In addition to checking IP
	    addresses
	    <command>match-clients</command> and <command>match-destinations</command>
	    can also take <command>keys</command> which provide an
	    mechanism for the
	    client to select the view.  A view can also be specified
	    as <command>match-recursive-only</command>, which
	    means that only recursive
	    requests from matching clients will match that view.
	    The order of the <command>view</command> statements is
	    significant —
	    a client request will be resolved in the context of the first
	    <command>view</command> that it matches.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Zones defined within a <command>view</command>
	    statement will
	    only be accessible to clients that match the <command>view</command>.
	    By defining a zone of the same name in multiple views, different
	    zone data can be given to different clients, for example,
	    "internal"
	    and "external" clients in a split DNS setup.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Many of the options given in the <command>options</command> statement
	    can also be used within a <command>view</command>
	    statement, and then
	    apply only when resolving queries with that view.  When no
	    view-specific
	    value is given, the value in the <command>options</command> statement
	    is used as a default.  Also, zone options can have default values
	    specified
	    in the <command>view</command> statement; these
	    view-specific defaults
	    take precedence over those in the <command>options</command> statement.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Views are class specific.  If no class is given, class IN
	    is assumed.  Note that all non-IN views must contain a hint zone,
	    since only the IN class has compiled-in default hints.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    If there are no <command>view</command> statements in
	    the config
	    file, a default view that matches any client is automatically
	    created
	    in class IN. Any <command>zone</command> statements
	    specified on
	    the top level of the configuration file are considered to be part
	    of
	    this default view, and the <command>options</command>
	    statement will
	    apply to the default view. If any explicit <command>view</command>
	    statements are present, all <command>zone</command>
	    statements must
	    occur inside <command>view</command> statements.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Here is an example of a typical split DNS setup implemented
	    using <command>view</command> statements:
	  </para>

<programlisting>view "internal" {
      // This should match our internal networks.
      match-clients { 10.0.0.0/8; };

      // Provide recursive service to internal
      // clients only.
      recursion yes;

      // Provide a complete view of the example.com
      // zone including addresses of internal hosts.
      zone "example.com" {
	    type master;
	    file "example-internal.db";
      };
};

view "external" {
      // Match all clients not matched by the
      // previous view.
      match-clients { any; };

      // Refuse recursive service to external clients.
      recursion no;

      // Provide a restricted view of the example.com
      // zone containing only publicly accessible hosts.
      zone "example.com" {
	   type master;
	   file "example-external.db";
      };
};

			A slave zone is a replica of a master

			The <command>masters</command> list
			specifies one or more IP addresses
			of master servers that the slave contacts to update
			its copy of the zone.
			Masters list elements can also be names of other

			By default, transfers are made from port 53 on the

			A stub zone is similar to a slave zone,

		      <para>
			Stub zones can be used to eliminate the need for glue

			This usage is not recommended for new configurations,
			and BIND 9

			In <acronym>BIND</acronym> 4/8, zone
			transfers of a parent zone
			included the NS records from stub children of that
			zone. This meant
			that, in some cases, users could get away with
			configuring child stubs
			only in the master server for the parent zone. <acronym>BIND</acronym>
			9 never mixes together zone data from different zones
			in this
			way. Therefore, if a <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 master serving a parent

			to use a set of internal name servers as the

	  <section xml:id="dynamic_update_policies"><info><title>Dynamic Update Policies</title></info>

	    <para><acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 supports two alternative
	      methods of granting clients the right to perform
	      dynamic updates to a zone, configured by the
	      <command>allow-update</command> and
	      <command>update-policy</command> option, respectively.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The <command>allow-update</command> clause is a simple
	      access control list.  Any client that matches
	      the ACL is granted permission to update any record
	      in the zone.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The <command>update-policy</command> clause
	      allows more fine-grained control over what updates are
	      allowed.  It specifies a set of rules, in which each rule
	      either grants or denies permission for one or more
	      names in the zone to be updated by one or more
	      identities. Identity is determined by the key that
	      signed the update request using either TSIG or SIG(0).
	      In most cases, <command>update-policy</command> rules
	      only apply to key-based identities.  There is no way
	      to specify update permissions based on client source
	      address.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      <command>update-policy</command> rules are only meaningful
	      for zones of type <command>master</command>, and are
	      not allowed in any other zone type.
	      It is a configuration error to specify both
	      <command>allow-update</command> and
	      <command>update-policy</command> at the same time.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      A pre-defined <command>update-policy</command> rule can be
	      switched on with the command
	      <command>update-policy local;</command>.
	      Using this in a zone causes
	      <command>named</command> to generate a TSIG session key
	      when starting up and store it in a file; this key can then
	      be used by local clients to update the zone while
	      <command>named</command> is running.
	      By default, the session key is stored in the file
	      <filename>/var/run/named/session.key</filename>, the key name
	      is "local-ddns", and the key algorithm is HMAC-SHA256.
	      These values are configurable with the
	      <command>session-keyfile</command>,
	      <command>session-keyname</command> and
	      <command>session-keyalg</command> options, respectively.
	      A client running on the local system, if run with appropriate
	      permissions, may read the session key from the key file and
	      use it to sign update requests.  The zone's update
	      policy will be set to allow that key to change any record
	      within the zone.  Assuming the key name is "local-ddns",
	      this policy is equivalent to:
	    </para>

	    <programlisting>update-policy { grant local-ddns zonesub any; };
	    </programlisting>

	    <para>
	      ...with the additional restriction that only clients
	      connecting from the local system will be permitted to send
	      updates.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      Note that only one session key is generated by
	      <command>named</command>; all zones configured to use
	      <command>update-policy local</command> will accept the same key.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The command <command>nsupdate -l</command> implements this
	      feature, sending requests to localhost and signing them using
	      the key retrieved from the session key file.
	    </para>

	    <para>
	      Other rule definitions look like this:
	    </para>

<programlisting>
( <command>grant</command> | <command>deny</command> ) <replaceable>identity</replaceable> <replaceable>ruletype</replaceable> <optional> <replaceable>name</replaceable> </optional> <optional> <replaceable>types</replaceable> </optional>
</programlisting>

	    <para>
	      Each rule grants or denies privileges.  Rules are checked
	      in the order in which they are specified in the
	      <command>update-policy</command> statement. Once a message
	      has successfully matched a rule, the operation is immediately
	      granted or denied, and no further rules are examined.  There
	      are 13 types of rules; the rule type is specified by the
	      <command>ruletype</command> field, and the interpretation
	      of other fields varies depending on the rule type.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      In general, a rule is matched when the
	      key that signed an update request matches the
	      <command>identity</command> field, the name of the record
	      to be updated matches the <command>name</command> field
	      (in the manner specified by the <command>ruletype</command>
	      field), and the type of the record to be updated matches the
	      <command>types</command> field. Details for each rule type
	      are described below.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The <command>identity</command> field must be set to
	      a fully-qualified domain name.  In most cases, this
	      represensts the name of the TSIG or SIG(0) key that must be
	      used to sign the update request.  If the specified name is a
	      wildcard, it is subject to DNS wildcard expansion, and the
	      rule may apply to multiple identities.  When a TKEY exchange
	      has been used to create a shared secret, the identity of
	      the key used to authenticate the TKEY exchange will be
	      used as the identity of the shared secret.  Some rule types
	      use identities matching the client's Kerberos principal
	      (e.g, <userinput>"host/machine@REALM"</userinput>) or
	      Windows realm (<userinput>machine$@REALM</userinput>).
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The <replaceable>name</replaceable> field also specifies
	      a fully-qualified domain name. This often
	      represents the name of the record to be updated.
	      Interpretation of this field is dependent on rule type.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      If no <command>types</command> are explicitly specified,
	      then a rule matches all types except RRSIG, NS, SOA, NSEC
	      and NSEC3. Types may be specified by name, including
	      "ANY" (ANY matches all types except NSEC and NSEC3,
	      which can never be updated).  Note that when an attempt
	      is made to delete all records associated with a name,
	      the rules are checked for each existing record type.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The <replaceable>ruletype</replaceable> field has 16
	      values:

	  <section xml:id="multiple_views"><info><title>Multiple views</title></info>

	    <para>
	      When multiple views are in use, a zone may be
	      referenced by more than one of them. Often, the views
	      will contain different zones with the same name, allowing
	      different clients to receive different answers for the same
	      queries. At times, however, it is desirable for multiple
	      views to contain identical zones.  The
	      <command>in-view</command> zone option provides an efficient
	      way to do this: it allows a view to reference a zone that
	      was defined in a previously configured view. Example:
	    </para>
	    <programlisting>
view internal {
    match-clients { 10/8; };

    zone example.com {
	type master;
	file "example-external.db";
    };
};

view external {
    match-clients { any; };

    zone example.com {
	in-view internal;
    };
};
	    </programlisting>
	    <para>
	      An <command>in-view</command> option cannot refer to a view
	      that is configured later in the configuration file.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      A <command>zone</command> statement which uses the
	      <command>in-view</command> option may not use any other
	      options with the exception of <command>forward</command>
	      and <command>forwarders</command>. (These options control
	      the behavior of the containing view, rather than changing
	      the zone object itself.)
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      Zone level acls (e.g. allow-query, allow-transfer) and
	      other configuration details of the zone are all set
	      in the view the referenced zone is defined in.  Care
	      need to be taken to ensure that acls are wide enough
	      for all views referencing the zone.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      An <command>in-view</command> zone cannot be used as a
	      response policy zone.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      An <command>in-view</command> zone is not intended to reference
	      a <command>forward</command> zone.

	  <para>
	    This section, largely borrowed from RFC 1034, describes the
	    concept of a Resource Record (RR) and explains when each is used.
	    Since the publication of RFC 1034, several new RRs have been
	    identified
	    and implemented in the DNS. These are also included.
	  </para>
	  <section><info><title>Resource Records</title></info>

	    <para>
	      A domain name identifies a node.  Each node has a set of
	      resource information, which may be empty.  The set of resource
	      information associated with a particular name is composed of
	      separate RRs. The order of RRs in a set is not significant and
	      need not be preserved by name servers, resolvers, or other
	      parts of the DNS. However, sorting of multiple RRs is
	      permitted for optimization purposes, for example, to specify
	      that a particular nearby server be tried first. See <xref linkend="the_sortlist_statement"/> and <xref linkend="rrset_ordering"/>.

	    <para>
	      The owner name is often implicit, rather than forming an
	      integral
	      part of the RR.  For example, many name servers internally form
	      tree
	      or hash structures for the name space, and chain RRs off nodes.
	      The remaining RR parts are the fixed header (type, class, TTL)
	      which is consistent for all RRs, and a variable part (RDATA)
	      that
	      fits the needs of the resource being described.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The meaning of the TTL field is a time limit on how long an
	      RR can be kept in a cache.  This limit does not apply to
	      authoritative
	      data in zones; it is also timed out, but by the refreshing
	      policies
	      for the zone.  The TTL is assigned by the administrator for the
	      zone where the data originates.  While short TTLs can be used to
	      minimize caching, and a zero TTL prohibits caching, the
	      realities
	      of Internet performance suggest that these times should be on
	      the
	      order of days for the typical host.  If a change can be
	      anticipated,
	      the TTL can be reduced prior to the change to minimize
	      inconsistency
	      during the change, and then increased back to its former value
	      following
	      the change.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The data in the RDATA section of RRs is carried as a combination
	      of binary strings and domain names.  The domain names are
	      frequently
	      used as "pointers" to other data in the DNS.
	    </para>
	  </section>
	  <section xml:id="rr_text"><info><title>Textual expression of RRs</title></info>

	    <para>
	      RRs are represented in binary form in the packets of the DNS
	      protocol, and are usually represented in highly encoded form
	      when
	      stored in a name server or resolver.  In the examples provided
	      in
	      RFC 1034, a style similar to that used in master files was
	      employed
	      in order to show the contents of RRs.  In this format, most RRs
	      are shown on a single line, although continuation lines are
	      possible
	      using parentheses.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The start of the line gives the owner of the RR.  If a line
	      begins with a blank, then the owner is assumed to be the same as
	      that of the previous RR.  Blank lines are often included for
	      readability.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      Following the owner, we list the TTL, type, and class of the
	      RR.  Class and type use the mnemonics defined above, and TTL is
	      an integer before the type field.  In order to avoid ambiguity
	      in
	      parsing, type and class mnemonics are disjoint, TTLs are
	      integers,
	      and the type mnemonic is always last. The IN class and TTL
	      values
	      are often omitted from examples in the interests of clarity.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The resource data or RDATA section of the RR are given using
	      knowledge of the typical representation for the data.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      For example, we might show the RRs carried in a message as:

	  <para>
	    As described above, domain servers store information as a
	    series of resource records, each of which contains a particular
	    piece of information about a given domain name (which is usually,
	    but not always, a host). The simplest way to think of a RR is as
	    a typed pair of data, a domain name matched with a relevant datum,
	    and stored with some additional type information to help systems
	    determine when the RR is relevant.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    MX records are used to control delivery of email. The data
	    specified in the record is a priority and a domain name. The
	    priority
	    controls the order in which email delivery is attempted, with the
	    lowest number first. If two priorities are the same, a server is
	    chosen randomly. If no servers at a given priority are responding,
	    the mail transport agent will fall back to the next largest
	    priority.
	    Priority numbers do not have any absolute meaning — they are
	    relevant
	    only respective to other MX records for that domain name. The
	    domain
	    name given is the machine to which the mail will be delivered.
	    It <emphasis>must</emphasis> have an associated address record
	    (A or AAAA) — CNAME is not sufficient.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    For a given domain, if there is both a CNAME record and an
	    MX record, the MX record is in error, and will be ignored.
	    Instead,
	    the mail will be delivered to the server specified in the MX
	    record
	    pointed to by the CNAME.
	    For example:

	    and PTR records. Entries in the in-addr.arpa domain are made in

		    <para>This
		      describes the owner name of the resource records
		      to be created.  Any single <command>$</command>
		      (dollar sign)
		      symbols within the <command>lhs</command> string
		      are replaced by the iterator value.

		      To get a $ in the output, you need to escape the
		      <command>$</command> using a backslash
		      <command>\</command>,
		      e.g. <command>\$</command>. The
		      <command>$</command> may optionally be followed
		      by modifiers which change the offset from the
		      iterator, field width and base.

		      Modifiers are introduced by a
		      <command>{</command> (left brace) immediately following the
		      <command>$</command> as
		      <command>${offset[,width[,base]]}</command>.
		      For example, <command>${-20,3,d}</command>
		      subtracts 20 from the current value, prints the
		      result as a decimal in a zero-padded field of
		      width 3.

		      Available output forms are decimal
		      (<command>d</command>), octal
		      (<command>o</command>), hexadecimal
		      (<command>x</command> or <command>X</command>
		      for uppercase) and nibble
		      (<command>n</command> or <command>N</command>\
		      for uppercase).  The default modifier is
		      <command>${0,0,d}</command>.  If the
		      <command>lhs</command> is not absolute, the
		      current <command>$ORIGIN</command> is appended
		      to the name.
		    </para>
		    <para>
		      In nibble mode the value will be treated as
		      if it was a reversed hexadecimal string
		      with each hexadecimal digit as a separate
		      label.  The width field includes the label
		      separator.
		    </para>

	    The <command>$GENERATE</command> directive is a <acronym>BIND</acronym> extension
	    and not part of the standard zone file format.
	  </para>
	</section>

	<section xml:id="zonefile_format"><info><title>Additional File Formats</title></info>

	  <para>
	    In addition to the standard textual format, BIND 9
	    supports the ability to read or dump to zone files in
	    other formats.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The <constant>raw</constant> format is
	    a binary representation of zone data in a manner similar
	    to that used in zone transfers.  Since it does not require
	    parsing text, load time is significantly reduced.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    An even faster alternative is the <constant>map</constant>
	    format, which is an image of a <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9
	    in-memory zone database; it is capable of being loaded
	    directly into memory via the <command>mmap()</command>
	    function; the zone can begin serving queries almost
	    immediately.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    For a primary server, a zone file in
	    <constant>raw</constant> or <constant>map</constant>
	    format is expected to be generated from a textual zone
	    file by the <command>named-compilezone</command> command.
	    For a secondary server or for a dynamic zone, it is automatically
	    generated (if this format is specified by the
	    <command>masterfile-format</command> option) when
	    <command>named</command> dumps the zone contents after
	    zone transfer or when applying prior updates.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If a zone file in a binary format needs manual modification,
	    it first must be converted to a textual form by the
	    <command>named-compilezone</command> command.  All
	    necessary modification should go to the text file, which
	    should then be converted to the binary form by the
	    <command>named-compilezone</command> command again.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Note that <command>map</command> format is extremely
	    architecture-specific.  A <constant>map</constant>
	    file <emphasis>cannot</emphasis> be used on a system
	    with different pointer size, endianness or data alignment
	    than the system on which it was generated, and should in
	    general be used only inside a single system.
	    While <constant>raw</constant> format uses
	    network byte order and avoids architecture-dependent
	    data alignment so that it is as portable as
	    possible, it is also primarily expected to be used
	    inside the same single system.  To export a
	    zone file in either <constant>raw</constant> or
	    <constant>map</constant> format, or make a
	    portable backup of such a file, conversion to
	    <constant>text</constant> format is recommended.

	<para>
	  A subset of Name Server Statistics is collected and shown

	  <command>zone-statistics</command> is set to
	  <userinput>full</userinput> (or <userinput>yes</userinput>
	  for backward compatibility. See the description of
	  <command>zone-statistics</command> in <xref linkend="options"/>
	  for further details.
	</para>

	<para>
	  These statistics counters are shown with their zone and

	  not configured with explicit views.</para>

	<para>
	  There are currently two user interfaces to get access to the
	  statistics.
	  One is in the plain text format dumped to the file specified
	  by the <command>statistics-file</command> configuration option.
	  The other is remotely accessible via a statistics channel
	  when the <command>statistics-channels</command> statement
	  is specified in the configuration file
	  (see <xref linkend="statschannels"/>.)
	</para>

	<section xml:id="statsfile"><info><title>The Statistics File</title></info>

	  <para>
	    The text format statistics dump begins with a line, like:

	  <para>
	    <command>+++ Statistics Dump +++ (973798949)</command>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The number in parentheses is a standard
	    Unix-style timestamp, measured as seconds since January 1, 1970.

	    Following
	    that line is a set of statistics information, which is categorized
	    as described above.
	    Each section begins with a line, like:
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    <command>++ Name Server Statistics ++</command>
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Each section consists of lines, each containing the statistics
	    counter value followed by its textual description.
	    See below for available counters.
	    For brevity, counters that have a value of 0 are not shown
	    in the statistics file.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The statistics dump ends with the line where the

	<section xml:id="statistics_counters"><info><title>Statistics Counters</title></info>

	  <para>
	    The following tables summarize statistics counters that
	    <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 provides.
	    For each row of the tables, the leftmost column is the
	    abbreviated symbol name of that counter.
	    These symbols are shown in the statistics information
	    accessed via an HTTP statistics channel.
	    The rightmost column gives the description of the counter,
	    which is also shown in the statistics file
	    (but, in this document, possibly with slight modification
	    for better readability).
	    Additional notes may also be provided in this column.
	    When a middle column exists between these two columns,
	    it gives the corresponding counter name of the
	    <acronym>BIND</acronym> 8 statistics, if applicable.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Note: BIND statistics counters are signed 64-bit values on
	    all platforms except one: 32-bit Windows, where they are
	    signed 32-bit values.  Given that 32-bit values have a
	    vastly smaller range than 64-bit values, BIND statistics
	    counters in 32-bit Windows builds overflow significantly
	    more quickly than on all other platforms.

      <section xml:id="Access_Control_Lists"><info><title>Access Control Lists</title></info>

	<para>
	  Access Control Lists (ACLs) are address match lists that
	  you can set up and nickname for future use in
	  <command>allow-notify</command>, <command>allow-query</command>,
	  <command>allow-query-on</command>, <command>allow-recursion</command>,
	  <command>blackhole</command>, <command>allow-transfer</command>,
	  <command>match-clients</command>, etc.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Using ACLs allows you to have finer control over who can access
	  your name server, without cluttering up your config files with huge
	  lists of IP addresses.
	</para>
	<para>
	  It is a <emphasis>good idea</emphasis> to use ACLs, and to
	  control access to your server. Limiting access to your server by
	  outside parties can help prevent spoofing and denial of service
	  (DoS) attacks against your server.
	</para>
	<para>
	  ACLs match clients on the basis of up to three characteristics:
	  1) The client's IP address; 2) the TSIG or SIG(0) key that was
	  used to sign the request, if any; and 3) an address prefix
	  encoded in an EDNS Client Subnet option, if any.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Here is an example of ACLs based on client addresses:
	</para>

<programlisting>
// Set up an ACL named "bogusnets" that will block
// RFC1918 space and some reserved space, which is
// commonly used in spoofing attacks.
acl bogusnets {
	0.0.0.0/8;  192.0.2.0/24; 224.0.0.0/3;
	10.0.0.0/8; 172.16.0.0/12; 192.168.0.0/16;
};

// Set up an ACL called our-nets. Replace this with the
// real IP numbers.
acl our-nets { x.x.x.x/24; x.x.x.x/21; };
options {
  ...
  ...
  allow-query { our-nets; };
  allow-recursion { our-nets; };
  ...
  blackhole { bogusnets; };
  ...
};

zone "example.com" {
  type master;
  file "m/example.com";
  allow-query { any; };
};
</programlisting>

	<para>
	  This allows authoritative queries for "example.com" from any
	  address, but recursive queries only from the networks specified
	  in "our-nets", and no queries at all from the networks
	  specified in "bogusnets".
	</para>
	<para>
	  In addition to network addresses and prefixes, which are
	  matched against the source address of the DNS request, ACLs
	  may include <option>key</option> elements, which specify the
	  name of a TSIG or SIG(0) key.
	</para>
	<para>
	  When <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 is built with GeoIP support,
	  ACLs can also be used for geographic access restrictions.
	  This is done by specifying an ACL element of the form:
	  <command>geoip <optional>db <replaceable>database</replaceable></optional> <replaceable>field</replaceable> <replaceable>value</replaceable></command>
	</para>
	<para>
	  The <replaceable>field</replaceable> indicates which field
	  to search for a match.  Available fields are "country",
	  "region", "city", "continent", "postal" (postal code),
	  "metro" (metro code), "area" (area code), "tz" (timezone),
	  "isp", "asnum", and "domain".
	</para>
	<para>
	  <replaceable>value</replaceable> is the value to search
	  for within the database.  A string may be quoted if it
	  contains spaces or other special characters.  An "asnum"
	  search for autonomous system number can be specified using
	  the string "ASNNNN" or the integer NNNN.
	  When "country" search is specified with a string is two
	  characters long, then it must be a standard ISO-3166-1
	  two-letter country code; otherwise it is interpreted as
	  the full name of the country.  Similarly, if this is a
	  "region" search and the string is two characters long,
	  then it treated as a standard two-letter state or province
	  abbreviation; otherwise it treated as the full name of the
	  state or province.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The <replaceable>database</replaceable> field indicates which
	  GeoIP database to search for a match.  In most cases this is
	  unnecessary, because most search fields can only be found in
	  a single database.  However, searches for "continent" or "country"
	  can be answered from either the "city" or "country" databases,
	  so for these search types, specifying a
	  <replaceable>database</replaceable>
	  will force the query to be answered from that database and no
	  other.  If <replaceable>database</replaceable> is not
	  specified, then these queries will be answered from the "city",
	  database if it is installed, or the "country" database if it
	  is installed, in that order. Valid database names are
	  "country", "city", "asnum", "isp", and "domain". (If using
	  the legacy GeoIP API, "netspeed" and "org" databases are also
	  available.)
	</para>
	<para>
	  Some example GeoIP ACLs:
	</para>
	<programlisting>geoip country US;
geoip country JP;
geoip db country country Canada;
geoip region WA;
geoip city "San Francisco";
geoip region Oklahoma;
geoip postal 95062;
geoip tz "America/Los_Angeles";
geoip org "Internet Systems Consortium";
</programlisting>

	<para>
	  ACLs use a "first-match" logic rather than "best-match":
	  if an address prefix matches an ACL element, then that ACL
	  is considered to have matched even if a later element would
	  have matched more specifically.  For example, the ACL
	  <command> { 10/8; !10.0.0.1; }</command> would actually
	  match a query from 10.0.0.1, because the first element
	  indicated that the query should be accepted, and the second
	  element is ignored.
	</para>
	<para>
	  When using "nested" ACLs (that is, ACLs included or referenced
	  within other ACLs), a negative match of a nested ACL will
	  the containing ACL to continue looking for matches.  This
	  enables complex ACLs to be constructed, in which multiple
	  client characteristics can be checked at the same time. For
	  example, to construct an ACL which allows queries only when
	  it originates from a particular network <emphasis>and</emphasis>
	  only when it is signed with a particular key, use:
	</para>
	<programlisting>
allow-query { !{ !10/8; any; }; key example; };
</programlisting>
	<para>
	  Within the nested ACL, any address that is
	  <emphasis>not</emphasis> in the 10/8 network prefix will
	  be rejected, and this will terminate processing of the
	  ACL.  Any address that <emphasis>is</emphasis> in the 10/8
	  network prefix will be accepted, but this causes a negative
	  match of the nested ACL, so the containing ACL continues
	  processing. The query will then be accepted if it is signed
	  by the key "example", and rejected otherwise.  The ACL, then,
	  will only matches when <emphasis>both</emphasis> conditions
	  are true.
	</para>

      <section xml:id="chroot_and_setuid"><info><title><command>Chroot</command> and <command>Setuid</command></title></info>

	<para>
	  On UNIX servers, it is possible to run <acronym>BIND</acronym>
	  in a <emphasis>chrooted</emphasis> environment (using
	  the <command>chroot()</command> function) by specifying
	  the <option>-t</option> option for <command>named</command>.
	  This can help improve system security by placing
	  <acronym>BIND</acronym> in a "sandbox", which will limit
	  the damage done if a server is compromised.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Another useful feature in the UNIX version of <acronym>BIND</acronym> is the
	  ability to run the daemon as an unprivileged user ( <option>-u</option> <replaceable>user</replaceable> ).
	  We suggest running as an unprivileged user when using the <command>chroot</command> feature.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Here is an example command line to load <acronym>BIND</acronym> in a <command>chroot</command> sandbox,
	  <command>/var/named</command>, and to run <command>named</command> <command>setuid</command> to
	  user 202:

	  <para>
	    In order for a <command>chroot</command> environment
	    to work properly in a particular directory (for example,
	    <filename>/var/named</filename>), you will need to set
	    up an environment that includes everything
	    <acronym>BIND</acronym> needs to run.  From
	    <acronym>BIND</acronym>'s point of view,
	    <filename>/var/named</filename> is the root of the
	    filesystem.  You will need to adjust the values of
	    options like <command>directory</command> and
	    <command>pid-file</command> to account for this.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Unlike with earlier versions of BIND, you typically will
	    <emphasis>not</emphasis> need to compile <command>named</command>
	    statically nor install shared libraries under the new root.
	    However, depending on your operating system, you may need
	    to set up things like
	    <filename>/dev/zero</filename>,
	    <filename>/dev/random</filename>,
	    <filename>/dev/log</filename>, and
	    <filename>/etc/localtime</filename>.

      <section xml:id="dynamic_update_security"><info><title>Dynamic Update Security</title></info>

	<para>
	  Access to the dynamic
	  update facility should be strictly limited.  In earlier versions of
	  <acronym>BIND</acronym>, the only way to do this was
	  based on the IP
	  address of the host requesting the update, by listing an IP address
	  or
	  network prefix in the <command>allow-update</command>
	  zone option.
	  This method is insecure since the source address of the update UDP
	  packet
	  is easily forged.  Also note that if the IP addresses allowed by the
	  <command>allow-update</command> option include the
	  address of a slave
	  server which performs forwarding of dynamic updates, the master can
	  be
	  trivially attacked by sending the update to the slave, which will
	  forward it to the master with its own source IP address causing the
	  master to approve it without question.
	</para>

	<para>
	  For these reasons, we strongly recommend that updates be
	  cryptographically authenticated by means of transaction signatures
	  (TSIG).  That is, the <command>allow-update</command>
	  option should
	  list only TSIG key names, not IP addresses or network
	  prefixes. Alternatively, the new <command>update-policy</command>
	  option can be used.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Some sites choose to keep all dynamically-updated DNS data
	  in a subdomain and delegate that subdomain to a separate zone. This
	  way, the top-level zone containing critical data such as the IP
	  addresses
	  of public web and mail servers need not allow dynamic update at
	  all.

	    The best solution to solving installation and

	<section><info><title>EDNS compliance issues</title></info>
	  <para>
	    EDNS (Extended DNS) is a standard that was first specified
	    in 1999. It is required for DNSSEC validation, DNS COOKIE
	    options, and other features. There are broken and outdated
	    DNS servers and firewalls still in use which misbehave when
	    queried with EDNS; for example, they may drop EDNS queries
	    rather than replying with FORMERR. BIND and other recursive
	    name servers have traditionally employed workarounds in this
	    situation, retrying queries in different ways and eventually
	    falling back to plain DNS queries without EDNS.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Such workarounds cause unnecessary resolution delays,
	    increase code complexity, and prevent deployment of new DNS
	    features. As of February 2019, all major DNS software vendors
	    have agreed to remove these workarounds; see
	    <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
	      xlink:href="https://dnsflagday.net">https://dnsflagday.net</link>
	    for further details. This change was implemented in BIND
	    as of release 9.14.0.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    As a result, some domains may be non-resolvable without manual
	    intervention.  In these cases, resolution can be restored by
	    adding <command>server</command> clauses for the offending
	    servers, specifying <command>edns no</command> or
	    <command>send-cookie no</command>, depending on the specific
	    noncompliance.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    To determine which <command>server</command> clause to use,
	    run the following commands to send queries to the authoritative
	    servers for the broken domain:
	  </para>
  <literallayout>
	    dig soa &lt;zone&gt; @&lt;server&gt; +dnssec
	    dig soa &lt;zone&gt; @&lt;server&gt; +dnssec +nocookie
	    dig soa &lt;zone&gt; @&lt;server&gt; +noedns
  </literallayout>
	  <para>
	    If the first command fails but the second succeeds, the
	    server most likely needs <command>send-cookie no</command>.
	    If the first two fail but the third succeeds, then the server
	    needs EDNS to be fully disabled with <command>edns no</command>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Please contact the administrators of noncompliant domains
	    and encourage them to upgrade their broken DNS servers.

      <section><info><title>Incrementing and Changing the Serial Number</title></info>

	<para>
	  Zone serial numbers are just numbers — they aren't
	  date related.  A lot of people set them to a number that
	  represents a date, usually of the form YYYYMMDDRR.
	  Occasionally they will make a mistake and set them to a
	  "date in the future" then try to correct them by setting
	  them to the "current date".  This causes problems because
	  serial numbers are used to indicate that a zone has been
	  updated.  If the serial number on the slave server is
	  lower than the serial number on the master, the slave
	  server will attempt to update its copy of the zone.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Setting the serial number to a lower number on the master
	  server than the slave server means that the slave will not perform
	  updates to its copy of the zone.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The solution to this is to add 2147483647 (2^31-1) to the
	  number, reload the zone and make sure all slaves have updated to
	  the new zone serial number, then reset the number to what you want
	  it to be, and reload the zone again.

	Although the "official" beginning of the Domain Name
	System occurred in 1984 with the publication of RFC 920, the
	core of the new system was described in 1983 in RFCs 882 and
	883. From 1984 to 1987, the ARPAnet (the precursor to today's
	Internet) became a testbed of experimentation for developing the
	new naming/addressing scheme in a rapidly expanding,
	operational network environment.  New RFCs were written and
	published in 1987 that modified the original documents to
	incorporate improvements based on the working model. RFC 1034,
	"Domain Names-Concepts and Facilities", and RFC 1035, "Domain
	Names-Implementation and Specification" were published and
	became the standards upon which all <acronym>DNS</acronym> implementations are
	built.

	Information
	Sciences Institute (USC-ISI) and SRI International's Network
	Information
	Center (SRI-NIC). A <acronym>DNS</acronym> server for
	Unix machines, the Berkeley Internet
	Name Domain (<acronym>BIND</acronym>) package, was

      <section xml:id="ipv6addresses"><info><title>IPv6 addresses (AAAA)</title></info>

	  <para>
	    IPv6 addresses are 128-bit identifiers for interfaces and
	    sets of interfaces which were introduced in the <acronym>DNS</acronym> to facilitate
	    scalable Internet routing. There are three types of addresses: <emphasis>Unicast</emphasis>,
	    an identifier for a single interface;
	    <emphasis>Anycast</emphasis>,
	    an identifier for a set of interfaces; and <emphasis>Multicast</emphasis>,
	    an identifier for a set of interfaces. Here we describe the global
	    Unicast address scheme. For more information, see RFC 3587,
	    "Global Unicast Address Format."
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    IPv6 unicast addresses consist of a
	    <emphasis>global routing prefix</emphasis>, a
	    <emphasis>subnet identifier</emphasis>, and an
	    <emphasis>interface identifier</emphasis>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The global routing prefix is provided by the
	    upstream provider or ISP, and (roughly) corresponds to the
	    IPv4 <emphasis>network</emphasis> section
	    of the address range.

	    The subnet identifier is for local subnetting, much the
	    same as subnetting an
	    IPv4 /16 network into /24 subnets.

	    The interface identifier is the address of an individual
	    interface on a given network; in IPv6, addresses belong to
	    interfaces rather than to machines.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The subnetting capability of IPv6 is much more flexible than
	    that of IPv4: subnetting can be carried out on bit boundaries,
	    in much the same way as Classless InterDomain Routing
	    (CIDR), and the DNS PTR representation ("nibble" format)
	    makes setting up reverse zones easier.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The Interface Identifier must be unique on the local link,
	    and is usually generated automatically by the IPv6
	    implementation, although it is usually possible to
	    override the default setting if necessary.  A typical IPv6
	    address might look like:
	    <command>2001:db8:201:9:a00:20ff:fe81:2b32</command>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    IPv6 address specifications often contain long strings
	    of zeros, so the architects have included a shorthand for
	    specifying
	    them. The double colon (`::') indicates the longest possible
	    string
	    of zeros that can fit, and can be used only once in an address.

	  <para>
	    Internet Drafts (IDs) are rough-draft working documents of
	    the Internet Engineering Task Force. They are, in essence, RFCs
	    in the preliminary stages of development. Implementors are
	    cautioned not
	    to regard IDs as archival, and they should not be quoted or cited
	    in any formal documents unless accompanied by the disclaimer that
	    they are "works in progress." IDs have a lifespan of six months
	    after which they are deleted unless updated by their authors.
