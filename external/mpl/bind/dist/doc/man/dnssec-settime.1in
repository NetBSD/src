.SH NAME
dnssec-settime \- set the key timing metadata for a DNSSEC key
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBdnssec\-settime\fP [\fB\-f\fP] [\fB\-K\fP directory] [\fB\-L\fP ttl] [\fB\-P\fP date/offset] [\fB\-P\fP ds date/offset] [\fB\-P\fP sync date/offset] [\fB\-A\fP date/offset] [\fB\-R\fP date/offset] [\fB\-I\fP date/offset] [\fB\-D\fP date/offset] [\fB\-D\fP ds date/offset] [\fB\-D\fP sync date/offset] [\fB\-S\fP key] [\fB\-i\fP interval] [\fB\-h\fP] [\fB\-V\fP] [\fB\-v\fP level] [\fB\-E\fP engine] {keyfile} [\fB\-s\fP] [\fB\-g\fP state] [\fB\-d\fP state date/offset] [\fB\-k\fP state date/offset] [\fB\-r\fP state date/offset] [\fB\-z\fP state date/offset]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBdnssec\-settime\fP reads a DNSSEC private key file and sets the key
timing metadata as specified by the \fI\%\-P\fP, \fI\%\-A\fP, \fI\%\-R\fP,
\fI\%\-I\fP, and \fI\%\-D\fP options. The metadata can then be used by
\fI\%dnssec\-signzone\fP or other signing software to determine when a key is
to be published, whether it should be used for signing a zone, etc.
.sp
If none of these options is set on the command line,
\fBdnssec\-settime\fP simply prints the key timing metadata already stored
in the key.
.sp
When key metadata fields are changed, both files of a key pair
(\fBKnnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key\fP and \fBKnnnn.+aaa+iiiii.private\fP) are
regenerated.
.sp
Metadata fields are stored in the private file. A
human\-readable description of the metadata is also placed in comments in
the key file. The private file\(aqs permissions are always set to be
inaccessible to anyone other than the owner (mode 0600).
.sp
When working with state files, it is possible to update the timing metadata in
those files as well with \fI\%\-s\fP\&.  With this option, it is also possible
to update key states with \fI\%\-d\fP (DS), \fI\%\-k\fP (DNSKEY), \fI\%\-r\fP
(RRSIG of KSK), or \fI\%\-z\fP (RRSIG of ZSK). Allowed states are HIDDEN,
RUMOURED, OMNIPRESENT, and UNRETENTIVE.
.sp
The goal state of the key can also be set with \fI\%\-g\fP\&. This should be either
HIDDEN or OMNIPRESENT, representing whether the key should be removed from the
zone or published.
.sp
It is NOT RECOMMENDED to manipulate state files manually, except for testing
purposes.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-f
This option forces an update of an old\-format key with no metadata fields. Without
this option, \fBdnssec\-settime\fP fails when attempting to update a
legacy key. With this option, the key is recreated in the new
format, but with the original key data retained. The key\(aqs creation
date is set to the present time. If no other values are
specified, then the key\(aqs publication and activation dates are also
set to the present time.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-K directory
This option sets the directory in which the key files are to reside.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-L ttl
This option sets the default TTL to use for this key when it is converted into a
DNSKEY RR. This is the TTL used when the key is imported into a zone,
unless there was already a DNSKEY RRset in
place, in which case the existing TTL takes precedence. If this
value is not set and there is no existing DNSKEY RRset, the TTL
defaults to the SOA TTL. Setting the default TTL to \fB0\fP or \fBnone\fP
removes it from the key.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h
This option emits a usage message and exits.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-V
This option prints version information.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-v level
This option sets the debugging level.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-E engine
This option specifies the cryptographic hardware to use, when applicable.
.sp
When BIND 9 is built with OpenSSL, this needs to be set to the OpenSSL
engine identifier that drives the cryptographic accelerator or
hardware service module (usually \fBpkcs11\fP).
.UNINDENT
.SH TIMING OPTIONS
.sp
Dates can be expressed in the format YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
(which is the format used inside key files),
or \(aqDay Mon DD HH:MM:SS YYYY\(aq (as printed by \fBdnssec\-settime \-p\fP),
or UNIX epoch time (as printed by \fBdnssec\-settime \-up\fP),
or the literal \fBnow\fP\&.
.sp
The argument can be followed by \fB+\fP or \fB\-\fP and an offset from the
given time. The literal \fBnow\fP can be omitted before an offset. The
offset can be followed by one of the suffixes \fBy\fP, \fBmo\fP, \fBw\fP,
\fBd\fP, \fBh\fP, or \fBmi\fP, so that it is computed in years (defined as
365 24\-hour days, ignoring leap years), months (defined as 30 24\-hour
days), weeks, days, hours, or minutes, respectively. Without a suffix,
the offset is computed in seconds.
.sp
To unset a date, use \fBnone\fP, \fBnever\fP, or \fBunset\fP\&.
.sp
All these formats are case\-insensitive.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-P date/offset
This option sets the date on which a key is to be published to the zone. After
that date, the key is included in the zone but is not used
to sign it.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B ds date/offset
This option sets the date on which DS records that match this key have been
seen in the parent zone.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B sync date/offset
This option sets the date on which CDS and CDNSKEY records that match this key
are to be published to the zone.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-A date/offset
This option sets the date on which the key is to be activated. After that date,
the key is included in the zone and used to sign it.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-R date/offset
This option sets the date on which the key is to be revoked. After that date, the
key is flagged as revoked. It is included in the zone and
is used to sign it.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-I date/offset
This option sets the date on which the key is to be retired. After that date, the
key is still included in the zone, but it is not used to
sign it.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-D date/offset
This option sets the date on which the key is to be deleted. After that date, the
key is no longer included in the zone. (However, it may remain in the key
repository.)
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B ds date/offset
This option sets the date on which the DS records that match this key have
been seen removed from the parent zone.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B sync date/offset
This option sets the date on which the CDS and CDNSKEY records that match this
key are to be deleted.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-S predecessor key
This option selects a key for which the key being modified is an explicit
successor. The name, algorithm, size, and type of the predecessor key
must exactly match those of the key being modified. The activation
date of the successor key is set to the inactivation date of the
predecessor. The publication date is set to the activation date
minus the prepublication interval, which defaults to 30 days.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-i interval
This option sets the prepublication interval for a key. If set, then the
publication and activation dates must be separated by at least this
much time. If the activation date is specified but the publication
date is not, the publication date defaults to this much time
before the activation date; conversely, if the publication date is
specified but not the activation date, activation is set to
this much time after publication.
.sp
If the key is being created as an explicit successor to another key,
then the default prepublication interval is 30 days; otherwise it is
zero.
.sp
As with date offsets, if the argument is followed by one of the
suffixes \fBy\fP, \fBmo\fP, \fBw\fP, \fBd\fP, \fBh\fP, or \fBmi\fP, the interval is
measured in years, months, weeks, days, hours, or minutes,
respectively. Without a suffix, the interval is measured in seconds.
.UNINDENT
.SH KEY STATE OPTIONS
.sp
To test dnssec\-policy it may be necessary to construct keys with artificial
state information; these options are used by the testing framework for that
purpose, but should never be used in production.
.sp
Known key states are HIDDEN, RUMOURED, OMNIPRESENT, and UNRETENTIVE.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-p C/P/Pds/Psync/A/R/I/D/Dds/Dsync/all
This option prints a specific metadata value or set of metadata values.
The \fI\%\-p\fP option may be followed by one or more of the following letters or
strings to indicate which value or values to print: \fBC\fP for the
creation date, \fBP\fP for the publication date, \fBPds\(ga for the DS publication
date, \(ga\(gaPsync\fP for the CDS and CDNSKEY publication date, \fBA\fP for the
