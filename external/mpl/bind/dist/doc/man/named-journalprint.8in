.TH "NAMED-JOURNALPRINT" "8" "@RELEASE_DATE@" "@BIND9_VERSION@" "BIND 9"
.SH NAME
named-journalprint \- print zone journal in human-readable form
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBnamed\-journalprint\fP [\-c serial] [\fB\-dux\fP] {journal}
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBnamed\-journalprint\fP scans the contents of a zone journal file,
printing it in a human\-readable form, or, optionally, converting it
to a different journal file format.
.sp
Journal files are automatically created by \fBnamed\fP when changes are
made to dynamic zones (e.g., by \fBnsupdate\fP). They record each addition
or deletion of a resource record, in binary format, allowing the changes
to be re\-applied to the zone when the server is restarted after a
shutdown or crash. By default, the name of the journal file is formed by
appending the extension \fB\&.jnl\fP to the name of the corresponding zone
file.
.sp
\fBnamed\-journalprint\fP converts the contents of a given journal file
into a human\-readable text format. Each line begins with \fBadd\fP or \fBdel\fP,
to indicate whether the record was added or deleted, and continues with
the resource record in master\-file format.
.sp
The \fB\-c\fP (compact) option provides a mechanism to reduce the size of
a journal by removing (most/all) transactions prior to the specified
serial number. Note: this option \fImust not\fP be used while \fBnamed\fP is
running, and can cause data loss if the zone file has not been updated
to contain the data being removed from the journal. Use with extreme caution.
.sp
The \fB\-x\fP option causes additional data about the journal file to be
printed at the beginning of the output and before each group of changes.
.sp
The \fB\-u\fP (upgrade) and \fB\-d\fP (downgrade) options recreate the journal
file with a modified format version.  The existing journal file is
replaced.  \fB\-d\fP writes out the journal in the format used by
versions of BIND up to 9.16.11; \fB\-u\fP writes it out in the format used
by versions since 9.16.13. (9.16.12 is omitted due to a journal\-formatting
bug in that release.) Note that these options \fImust not\fP be used while
\fBnamed\fP is running.
