.TH "DNSSEC-IMPORTKEY" "1" "@RELEASE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE_VERSION@" "BIND 9"
.SH NAME
dnssec-importkey \- import DNSKEY records from external systems so they can be managed
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBdnssec\-importkey\fP [\fB\-K\fP directory] [\fB\-L\fP ttl] [\fB\-P\fP date/offset] [\fB\-P\fP sync date/offset] [\fB\-D\fP date/offset] [\fB\-D\fP sync date/offset] [\fB\-h\fP] [\fB\-v\fP level] [\fB\-V\fP] {keyfile}
.sp
\fBdnssec\-importkey\fP {\fB\-f\fP filename} [\fB\-K\fP directory] [\fB\-L\fP ttl] [\fB\-P\fP date/offset] [\fB\-P\fP sync date/offset] [\fB\-D\fP date/offset] [\fB\-D\fP sync date/offset] [\fB\-h\fP] [\fB\-v\fP level] [\fB\-V\fP] [dnsname]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBdnssec\-importkey\fP reads a public DNSKEY record and generates a pair
of .key/.private files. The DNSKEY record may be read from an
existing .key file, in which case a corresponding .private file is
generated, or it may be read from any other file or from the standard
input, in which case both .key and .private files are generated.
.sp
The newly created .private file does \fInot\fP contain private key data, and
cannot be used for signing. However, having a .private file makes it
possible to set publication (\fI\%\-P\fP) and deletion (\fI\%\-D\fP) times for the
key, which means the public key can be added to and removed from the
DNSKEY RRset on schedule even if the true private key is stored offline.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-f filename
This option indicates the zone file mode. Instead of a public keyfile name, the argument is the
DNS domain name of a zone master file, which can be read from
\fBfilename\fP\&. If the domain name is the same as \fBfilename\fP, then it may be
omitted.
.sp
If \fBfilename\fP is set to \fB\(dq\-\(dq\fP, then the zone data is read from the
standard input.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-K directory
This option sets the directory in which the key files are to reside.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-L ttl
This option sets the default TTL to use for this key when it is converted into a
DNSKEY RR. This is the TTL used when the key is imported into a zone,
unless there was already a DNSKEY RRset in
place, in which case the existing TTL takes precedence. Setting the default TTL to \fB0\fP or \fBnone\fP
removes it from the key.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h
This option emits a usage message and exits.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-v level
This option sets the debugging level.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-V
This option prints version information.
.UNINDENT
.SH TIMING OPTIONS
.sp
Dates can be expressed in the format YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.
(which is the format used inside key files),
or \(aqDay Mon DD HH:MM:SS YYYY\(aq (as printed by \fBdnssec\-settime \-p\fP),
or UNIX epoch time (as printed by \fBdnssec\-settime \-up\fP),
or the literal \fBnow\fP\&.
.sp
The argument can be followed by \fB+\fP or \fB\-\fP and an offset from the
given time. The literal \fBnow\fP can be omitted before an offset. The
offset can be followed by one of the suffixes \fBy\fP, \fBmo\fP, \fBw\fP,
\fBd\fP, \fBh\fP, or \fBmi\fP, so that it is computed in years (defined as
365 24\-hour days, ignoring leap years), months (defined as 30 24\-hour
days), weeks, days, hours, or minutes, respectively. Without a suffix,
the offset is computed in seconds.
.sp
To explicitly prevent a date from being set, use \fBnone\fP, \fBnever\fP,
or \fBunset\fP\&.
.sp
All these formats are case\-insensitive.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-P date/offset
This option sets the date on which a key is to be published to the zone. After
that date, the key is included in the zone but is not used
to sign it.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B sync date/offset
This option sets the date on which CDS and CDNSKEY records that match this key
are to be published to the zone.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-D date/offset
This option sets the date on which the key is to be deleted. After that date, the
key is no longer included in the zone. (However, it may remain in the key
repository.)
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B sync date/offset
This option sets the date on which the CDS and CDNSKEY records that match this
key are to be deleted.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH FILES
.sp
A keyfile can be designed by the key identification \fBKnnnn.+aaa+iiiii\fP
or the full file name \fBKnnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key\fP, as generated by
\fI\%dnssec\-keygen\fP\&.
