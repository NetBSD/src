.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBdelv\fP is a tool for sending DNS queries and validating the results,
using the same internal resolver and validator logic as \fI\%named\fP\&.
.sp
\fBdelv\fP sends to a specified name server all queries needed to
fetch and validate the requested data; this includes the original
requested query, subsequent queries to follow CNAME or DNAME chains,
queries for DNSKEY, and DS records to establish a chain of trust for
DNSSEC validation. It does not perform iterative resolution, but
simulates the behavior of a name server configured for DNSSEC validating
and forwarding.
.sp
By default, responses are validated using the built\-in DNSSEC trust anchor
for the root zone (\(dq.\(dq). Records returned by \fBdelv\fP are either fully
validated or were not signed. If validation fails, an explanation of the
failure is included in the output; the validation process can be traced
in detail. Because \fBdelv\fP does not rely on an external server to carry
out validation, it can be used to check the validity of DNS responses in
environments where local name servers may not be trustworthy.
.sp
Unless it is told to query a specific name server, \fBdelv\fP tries
each of the servers listed in \fB/etc/resolv.conf\fP\&. If no usable server
addresses are found, \fBdelv\fP sends queries to the localhost
addresses (127.0.0.1 for IPv4, ::1 for IPv6).
.sp
When no command\-line arguments or options are given, \fBdelv\fP
performs an NS query for \(dq.\(dq (the root zone).
.SH SIMPLE USAGE
.sp
A typical invocation of \fBdelv\fP looks like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
delv @server name type
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
where:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B server
is the name or IP address of the name server to query. This can be an
IPv4 address in dotted\-decimal notation or an IPv6 address in
colon\-delimited notation. When the supplied \fBserver\fP argument is a
hostname, \fBdelv\fP resolves that name before querying that name
server (note, however, that this initial lookup is \fInot\fP validated by
DNSSEC).
.sp
If no \fBserver\fP argument is provided, \fBdelv\fP consults
\fB/etc/resolv.conf\fP; if an address is found there, it queries the
name server at that address. If either of the \fI\%\-4\fP or \fI\%\-6\fP
options is in use, then only addresses for the corresponding
transport are tried. If no usable addresses are found, \fBdelv\fP
sends queries to the localhost addresses (127.0.0.1 for IPv4, ::1
for IPv6).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B name
is the domain name to be looked up.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B type
indicates what type of query is required \- ANY, A, MX, etc.
\fBtype\fP can be any valid query type. If no \fBtype\fP argument is
supplied, \fBdelv\fP performs a lookup for an A record.
.UNINDENT
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-a anchor\-file
This option specifies a file from which to read DNSSEC trust anchors. The default
is \fB@sysconfdir@/bind.keys\fP, which is included with BIND 9 and contains one
or more trust anchors for the root zone (\(dq.\(dq).
.sp
Keys that do not match the root zone name are ignored. An alternate
key name can be specified using the \fI\%+root\fP option.
.sp
Note: When reading the trust anchor file, \fBdelv\fP treats \fBtrust\-anchors\fP,
\fBinitial\-key\fP, and \fBstatic\-key\fP identically. That is, for a managed key,
it is the \fIinitial\fP key that is trusted; \fI\%RFC 5011\fP key management is not
supported. \fBdelv\fP does not consult the managed\-keys database maintained by
\fI\%named\fP, which means that if either of the keys in \fB@sysconfdir@/bind.keys\fP is
revoked and rolled over, \fB@sysconfdir@/bind.keys\fP must be updated to
use DNSSEC validation in \fBdelv\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-b address
This option sets the source IP address of the query to \fBaddress\fP\&. This must be
a valid address on one of the host\(aqs network interfaces, or \fB0.0.0.0\fP,
or \fB::\fP\&. An optional source port may be specified by appending
\fB#<port>\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-c class
This option sets the query class for the requested data. Currently, only class
\(dqIN\(dq is supported in \fBdelv\fP and any other value is ignored.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-d level
This option sets the systemwide debug level to \fBlevel\fP\&. The allowed range is
from 0 to 99. The default is 0 (no debugging). Debugging traces from
\fBdelv\fP become more verbose as the debug level increases. See the
\fI\%+mtrace\fP, \fI\%+rtrace\fP, and \fI\%+vtrace\fP options below for
additional debugging details.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h
This option displays the \fBdelv\fP help usage output and exits.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-i
This option sets insecure mode, which disables internal DNSSEC validation. (Note,
however, that this does not set the CD bit on upstream queries. If the
server being queried is performing DNSSEC validation, then it does
not return invalid data; this can cause \fBdelv\fP to time out. When it
is necessary to examine invalid data to debug a DNSSEC problem, use
\fI\%dig +cd\fP\&.)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-m
This option enables memory usage debugging.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-p port#
This option specifies a destination port to use for queries, instead of the
standard DNS port number 53. This option is used with a name
server that has been configured to listen for queries on a
non\-standard port number.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-q name
This option sets the query name to \fBname\fP\&. While the query name can be
specified without using the \fI\%\-q\fP option, it is sometimes necessary to
disambiguate names from types or classes (for example, when looking
up the name \(dqns\(dq, which could be misinterpreted as the type NS, or
\(dqch\(dq, which could be misinterpreted as class CH).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-t type
This option sets the query type to \fBtype\fP, which can be any valid query type
supported in BIND 9 except for zone transfer types AXFR and IXFR. As
with \fI\%\-q\fP, this is useful to distinguish query\-name types or classes
when they are ambiguous. It is sometimes necessary to disambiguate
names from types.
.sp
The default query type is \(dqA\(dq, unless the \fI\%\-x\fP option is supplied
to indicate a reverse lookup, in which case it is \(dqPTR\(dq.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-v
This option prints the \fBdelv\fP version and exits.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-x addr
This option performs a reverse lookup, mapping an address to a name. \fBaddr\fP
is an IPv4 address in dotted\-decimal notation, or a colon\-delimited
IPv6 address. When \fI\%\-x\fP is used, there is no need to provide the
\fBname\fP or \fBtype\fP arguments; \fBdelv\fP automatically performs a
lookup for a name like \fB11.12.13.10.in\-addr.arpa\fP and sets the
query type to PTR. IPv6 addresses are looked up using nibble format
under the IP6.ARPA domain.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-4
This option forces \fBdelv\fP to only use IPv4.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-6
This option forces \fBdelv\fP to only use IPv6.
.UNINDENT
.SH QUERY OPTIONS
.sp
\fBdelv\fP provides a number of query options which affect the way results
are displayed, and in some cases the way lookups are performed.
.sp
Each query option is identified by a keyword preceded by a plus sign
(\fB+\fP). Some keywords set or reset an option. These may be preceded by
the string \fBno\fP to negate the meaning of that keyword. Other keywords
assign values to options like the timeout interval. They have the form
\fB+keyword=value\fP\&. The query options are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B +cdflag, +nocdflag
This option controls whether to set the CD (checking disabled) bit in queries
sent by \fBdelv\fP\&. This may be useful when troubleshooting DNSSEC
problems from behind a validating resolver. A validating resolver
blocks invalid responses, making it difficult to retrieve them
for analysis. Setting the CD flag on queries causes the resolver
to return invalid responses, which \fBdelv\fP can then validate
internally and report the errors in detail.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B +class, +noclass
This option controls whether to display the CLASS when printing a record. The
default is to display the CLASS.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B +ttl, +nottl
This option controls whether to display the TTL when printing a record. The
default is to display the TTL.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B +rtrace, +nortrace
This option toggles resolver fetch logging. This reports the name and type of each
query sent by \fBdelv\fP in the process of carrying out the resolution
and validation process, including the original query
and all subsequent queries to follow CNAMEs and to establish a chain
of trust for DNSSEC validation.
.sp
This is equivalent to setting the debug level to 1 in the \(dqresolver\(dq
logging category. Setting the systemwide debug level to 1 using the
\fI\%\-d\fP option produces the same output, but affects other
logging categories as well.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B +mtrace, +nomtrace
This option toggles message logging. This produces a detailed dump of the
responses received by \fBdelv\fP in the process of carrying out the
resolution and validation process.
.sp
This is equivalent to setting the debug level to 10 for the \(dqpackets\(dq
module of the \(dqresolver\(dq logging category. Setting the systemwide
debug level to 10 using the \fI\%\-d\fP option produces the same
output, but affects other logging categories as well.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B +vtrace, +novtrace
This option toggles validation logging. This shows the internal process of the
validator as it determines whether an answer is validly signed,
unsigned, or invalid.
.sp
This is equivalent to setting the debug level to 3 for the
\(dqvalidator\(dq module of the \(dqdnssec\(dq logging category. Setting the
systemwide debug level to 3 using the \fI\%\-d\fP option produces the
same output, but affects other logging categories as well.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B +short, +noshort
This option toggles between verbose and terse answers. The default is to print the answer in a
verbose form.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B +comments, +nocomments
This option toggles the display of comment lines in the output. The default is to
print comments.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B +rrcomments, +norrcomments
This option toggles the display of per\-record comments in the output (for example,
human\-readable key information about DNSKEY records). The default is
to print per\-record comments.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B +crypto, +nocrypto
This option toggles the display of cryptographic fields in DNSSEC records. The
contents of these fields are unnecessary to debug most DNSSEC
validation failures and removing them makes it easier to see the
common failures. The default is to display the fields. When omitted,
they are replaced by the string \fB[omitted]\fP or, in the DNSKEY case, the
key ID is displayed as the replacement, e.g. \fB[ key id = value ]\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B +trust, +notrust
This option controls whether to display the trust level when printing a record.
The default is to display the trust level.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B +split[=W], +nosplit
This option splits long hex\- or base64\-formatted fields in resource records into
chunks of \fBW\fP characters (where \fBW\fP is rounded up to the nearest
multiple of 4). \fB+nosplit\fP or \fB+split=0\fP causes fields not to be
split at all. The default is 56 characters, or 44 characters when
multiline mode is active.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B +all, +noall
This option sets or clears the display options \fI\%+comments\fP,
\fI\%+rrcomments\fP, and \fI\%+trust\fP as a group.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B +multiline, +nomultiline
This option prints long records (such as RRSIG, DNSKEY, and SOA records) in a
verbose multi\-line format with human\-readable comments. The default
is to print each record on a single line, to facilitate machine
parsing of the \fBdelv\fP output.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B +dnssec, +nodnssec
This option indicates whether to display RRSIG records in the \fBdelv\fP output.
The default is to do so. Note that (unlike in \fI\%dig\fP) this does
\fInot\fP control whether to request DNSSEC records or to
validate them. DNSSEC records are always requested, and validation
always occurs unless suppressed by the use of \fI\%\-i\fP or
\fI\%+noroot\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B +root[=ROOT], +noroot
This option indicates whether to perform conventional DNSSEC validation, and if so,
specifies the name of a trust anchor. The default is to validate using a
trust anchor of \(dq.\(dq (the root zone), for which there is a built\-in key. If
specifying a different trust anchor, then \fI\%\-a\fP must be used to specify a
file containing the key.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B +tcp, +notcp
This option controls whether to use TCP when sending queries. The default is to
use UDP unless a truncated response has been received.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B +unknownformat, +nounknownformat
This option prints all RDATA in unknown RR\-type presentation format (\fI\%RFC 3597\fP).
The default is to print RDATA for known types in the type\(aqs
presentation format.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B +yaml, +noyaml
This option prints response data in YAML format.
