named-checkzone \- zone file validity checking or converting tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBnamed\-checkzone\fP [\fB\-d\fP] [\fB\-h\fP] [\fB\-j\fP] [\fB\-q\fP] [\fB\-v\fP] [\fB\-c\fP class] [\fB\-f\fP format] [\fB\-F\fP format] [\fB\-J\fP filename] [\fB\-i\fP mode] [\fB\-k\fP mode] [\fB\-m\fP mode] [\fB\-M\fP mode] [\fB\-n\fP mode] [\fB\-l\fP ttl] [\fB\-L\fP serial] [\fB\-o\fP filename] [\fB\-r\fP mode] [\fB\-s\fP style] [\fB\-S\fP mode] [\fB\-t\fP directory] [\fB\-T\fP mode] [\fB\-w\fP directory] [\fB\-D\fP] [\fB\-W\fP mode] {zonename} {filename}
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBnamed\-checkzone\fP checks the syntax and integrity of a zone file. It
performs the same checks as \fI\%named\fP does when loading a zone. This
makes \fBnamed\-checkzone\fP useful for checking zone files before
configuring them into a name server.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-d
This option enables debugging.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h
This option prints the usage summary and exits.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-q
This option sets quiet mode, which only sets an exit code to indicate
successful or failed completion.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-v
This option prints the version of the \fBnamed\-checkzone\fP program and exits.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-j
When loading a zone file, this option tells \fI\%named\fP to read the journal if it exists. The journal
file name is assumed to be the zone file name with the
string \fB\&.jnl\fP appended.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-J filename
When loading the zone file, this option tells \fI\%named\fP to read the journal from the given file, if
it exists. This implies \fI\%\-j\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-c class
This option specifies the class of the zone. If not specified, \fBIN\fP is assumed.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-i mode
This option performs post\-load zone integrity checks. Possible modes are
\fBfull\fP (the default), \fBfull\-sibling\fP, \fBlocal\fP,
\fBlocal\-sibling\fP, and \fBnone\fP\&.
.sp
Mode \fBfull\fP checks that MX records refer to A or AAAA records
(both in\-zone and out\-of\-zone hostnames). Mode \fBlocal\fP only
checks MX records which refer to in\-zone hostnames.
.sp
Mode \fBfull\fP checks that SRV records refer to A or AAAA records
(both in\-zone and out\-of\-zone hostnames). Mode \fBlocal\fP only
checks SRV records which refer to in\-zone hostnames.
.sp
Mode \fBfull\fP checks that delegation NS records refer to A or AAAA
records (both in\-zone and out\-of\-zone hostnames). It also checks that
glue address records in the zone match those advertised by the child.
Mode \fBlocal\fP only checks NS records which refer to in\-zone
hostnames or verifies that some required glue exists, i.e., when the
name server is in a child zone.
.sp
Modes \fBfull\-sibling\fP and \fBlocal\-sibling\fP disable sibling glue
checks, but are otherwise the same as \fBfull\fP and \fBlocal\fP,
respectively.
.sp
Mode \fBnone\fP disables the checks.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-f format
This option specifies the format of the zone file. Possible formats are
\fBtext\fP (the default), and \fBraw\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-F format
This option specifies the format of the output file specified. For
\fBnamed\-checkzone\fP, this does not have any effect unless it dumps
the zone contents.
.sp
Possible formats are \fBtext\fP (the default), which is the standard
textual representation of the zone, and \fBraw\fP and \fBraw=N\fP, which
store the zone in a binary format for rapid loading by \fI\%named\fP\&.
\fBraw=N\fP specifies the format version of the raw zone file: if \fBN\fP is
0, the raw file can be read by any version of \fI\%named\fP; if N is 1, the
file can only be read by release 9.9.0 or higher. The default is 1.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-k mode
This option performs \fBcheck\-names\fP checks with the specified failure mode.
Possible modes are \fBfail\fP, \fBwarn\fP (the default), and \fBignore\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-l ttl
This option sets a maximum permissible TTL for the input file. Any record with a
TTL higher than this value causes the zone to be rejected. This
is similar to using the \fBmax\-zone\-ttl\fP option in \fI\%named.conf\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-L serial
When compiling a zone to \fBraw\fP format, this option sets the \(dqsource
serial\(dq value in the header to the specified serial number. This is
expected to be used primarily for testing purposes.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-m mode
This option specifies whether MX records should be checked to see if they are
addresses. Possible modes are \fBfail\fP, \fBwarn\fP (the default), and
\fBignore\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-M mode
This option checks whether a MX record refers to a CNAME. Possible modes are
\fBfail\fP, \fBwarn\fP (the default), and \fBignore\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-n mode
This option specifies whether NS records should be checked to see if they are
addresses. Possible modes are \fBfail\fP, \fBwarn\fP (the default), and \fBignore\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-o filename
This option writes the zone output to \fBfilename\fP\&. If \fBfilename\fP is \fB\-\fP, then
the zone output is written to standard output.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-r mode
This option checks for records that are treated as different by DNSSEC but are
semantically equal in plain DNS. Possible modes are \fBfail\fP,
\fBwarn\fP (the default), and \fBignore\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-s style
This option specifies the style of the dumped zone file. Possible styles are
\fBfull\fP (the default) and \fBrelative\fP\&. The \fBfull\fP format is most
suitable for processing automatically by a separate script.
The relative format is more human\-readable and is thus
suitable for editing by hand. This does not have any effect unless it dumps
the zone contents. It also does not have any meaning if the output format
is not text.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-S mode
This option checks whether an SRV record refers to a CNAME. Possible modes are
\fBfail\fP, \fBwarn\fP (the default), and \fBignore\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-t directory
This option tells \fI\%named\fP to chroot to \fBdirectory\fP, so that \fBinclude\fP directives in the
configuration file are processed as if run by a similarly chrooted
\fI\%named\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-T mode
This option checks whether Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records exist and issues a
warning if an SPF\-formatted TXT record is not also present. Possible
modes are \fBwarn\fP (the default) and \fBignore\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-w directory
This option instructs \fI\%named\fP to chdir to \fBdirectory\fP, so that relative filenames in master file
\fB$INCLUDE\fP directives work. This is similar to the directory clause in
\fI\%named.conf\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-D
This option dumps the zone file in canonical format.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-W mode
This option specifies whether to check for non\-terminal wildcards. Non\-terminal
wildcards are almost always the result of a failure to understand the
wildcard matching algorithm (\fI\%RFC 4592\fP). Possible modes are \fBwarn\fP
(the default) and \fBignore\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B zonename
This indicates the domain name of the zone being checked.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B filename
This is the name of the zone file.
.UNINDENT
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
\fBnamed\-checkzone\fP returns an exit status of 1 if errors were detected
and 0 otherwise.
