.TH "NSEC3HASH" "8" "@RELEASE_DATE@" "@BIND9_VERSION@" "BIND 9"
.SH NAME
nsec3hash \- generate NSEC3 hash
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBnsec3hash\fP {salt} {algorithm} {iterations} {domain}
.sp
\fBnsec3hash\fP \fB\-r\fP {algorithm} {flags} {iterations} {salt} {domain}
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBnsec3hash\fP generates an NSEC3 hash based on a set of NSEC3
parameters. This can be used to check the validity of NSEC3 records in a
signed zone.
.sp
If this command is invoked as \fBnsec3hash \-r\fP, it takes arguments in
order, matching the first four fields of an NSEC3 record followed by the
domain name: \fBalgorithm\fP, \fBflags\fP, \fBiterations\fP, \fBsalt\fP, \fBdomain\fP\&. This makes it
convenient to copy and paste a portion of an NSEC3 or NSEC3PARAM record
into a command line to confirm the correctness of an NSEC3 hash.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBsalt\fP
This is the salt provided to the hash algorithm.
.TP
.B \fBalgorithm\fP
This is a number indicating the hash algorithm. Currently the only supported
hash algorithm for NSEC3 is SHA\-1, which is indicated by the number
1; consequently "1" is the only useful value for this argument.
.TP
.B \fBflags\fP
This is provided for compatibility with NSEC3 record presentation format, but
is ignored since the flags do not affect the hash.
.TP
.B \fBiterations\fP
This is the number of additional times the hash should be performed.
.TP
.B \fBdomain\fP
This is the domain name to be hashed.
