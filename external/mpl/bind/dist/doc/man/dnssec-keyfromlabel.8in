.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBdnssec\-keyfromlabel\fP generates a pair of key files that reference a
key object stored in a cryptographic hardware service module (HSM). The
private key file can be used for DNSSEC signing of zone data as if it
were a conventional signing key created by \fBdnssec\-keygen\fP, but the
key material is stored within the HSM and the actual signing takes
place there.
.sp
The \fBname\fP of the key is specified on the command line. This must
match the name of the zone for which the key is being generated.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-a algorithm\fP
This option selects the cryptographic algorithm. The value of \fBalgorithm\fP must
be one of RSASHA1, NSEC3RSASHA1, RSASHA256, RSASHA512,
ECDSAP256SHA256, ECDSAP384SHA384, ED25519, or ED448.
.sp
These values are case\-insensitive. In some cases, abbreviations are
supported, such as ECDSA256 for ECDSAP256SHA256 and ECDSA384 for
ECDSAP384SHA384. If RSASHA1 is specified along with the \fB\-3\fP
option, then NSEC3RSASHA1 is used instead.
.sp
This option is mandatory except when using the
\fB\-S\fP option, which copies the algorithm from the predecessory key.
.sp
Changed in version 9.12.0: The default value RSASHA1 for newly generated keys was removed.

.TP
.B \fB\-3\fP
This option uses an NSEC3\-capable algorithm to generate a DNSSEC key. If this
option is used with an algorithm that has both NSEC and NSEC3
versions, then the NSEC3 version is used; for example,
\fBdnssec\-keygen \-3a RSASHA1\fP specifies the NSEC3RSASHA1 algorithm.
.TP
.B \fB\-E engine\fP
This option specifies the cryptographic hardware to use.
.sp
When BIND 9 is built with OpenSSL, this needs to be set to the OpenSSL
engine identifier that drives the cryptographic accelerator or
hardware service module (usually \fBpkcs11\fP). When BIND is
built with native PKCS#11 cryptography (\fB\-\-enable\-native\-pkcs11\fP), it
defaults to the path of the PKCS#11 provider library specified via
\fB\-\-with\-pkcs11\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-l label\fP
This option specifies the label for a key pair in the crypto hardware.
.sp
When BIND 9 is built with OpenSSL\-based PKCS#11 support, the label is
an arbitrary string that identifies a particular key. It may be
preceded by an optional OpenSSL engine name, followed by a colon, as
in \fBpkcs11:keylabel\fP\&.
.sp
When BIND 9 is built with native PKCS#11 support, the label is a
PKCS#11 URI string in the format
\fBpkcs11:keyword\e =value[;\e keyword\e =value;...]\fP\&. Keywords
include \fBtoken\fP, which identifies the HSM; \fBobject\fP, which identifies
the key; and \fBpin\-source\fP, which identifies a file from which the
HSM\(aqs PIN code can be obtained. The label is stored in the
on\-disk \fBprivate\fP file.
.sp
If the label contains a \fBpin\-source\fP field, tools using the
generated key files are able to use the HSM for signing and other
operations without any need for an operator to manually enter a PIN.
Note: Making the HSM\(aqs PIN accessible in this manner may reduce the
security advantage of using an HSM; use caution
with this feature.
.TP
.B \fB\-n nametype\fP
This option specifies the owner type of the key. The value of \fBnametype\fP must
either be ZONE (for a DNSSEC zone key (KEY/DNSKEY)), HOST or ENTITY
(for a key associated with a host (KEY)), USER (for a key associated
with a user (KEY)), or OTHER (DNSKEY). These values are
case\-insensitive.
.TP
.B \fB\-C\fP
This option enables compatibility mode, which generates an old\-style key, without any metadata.
By default, \fBdnssec\-keyfromlabel\fP includes the key\(aqs creation
date in the metadata stored with the private key; other dates may
be set there as well, including publication date, activation date, etc. Keys
that include this data may be incompatible with older versions of
BIND; the \fB\-C\fP option suppresses them.
.TP
.B \fB\-c class\fP
This option indicates that the DNS record containing the key should have the
specified class. If not specified, class IN is used.
.TP
.B \fB\-f flag\fP
This option sets the specified flag in the \fBflag\fP field of the KEY/DNSKEY record.
The only recognized flags are KSK (Key\-Signing Key) and REVOKE.
.TP
.B \fB\-G\fP
This option generates a key, but does not publish it or sign with it. This option is
incompatible with \fB\-P\fP and \fB\-A\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-h\fP
This option prints a short summary of the options and arguments to
\fBdnssec\-keyfromlabel\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-K directory\fP
This option sets the directory in which the key files are to be written.
.TP
.B \fB\-k\fP
This option generates KEY records rather than DNSKEY records.
.TP
.B \fB\-L\fP ttl
This option sets the default TTL to use for this key when it is converted into a
DNSKEY RR. This is the TTL used when the key is imported into a zone,
unless there was already a DNSKEY RRset in
place, in which case the existing TTL would take precedence. Setting
the default TTL to \fB0\fP or \fBnone\fP removes it.
.TP
.B \fB\-p protocol\fP
This option sets the protocol value for the key. The protocol is a number between
0 and 255. The default is 3 (DNSSEC). Other possible values for this
argument are listed in \fI\%RFC 2535\fP and its successors.
.TP
.B \fB\-S key\fP
This option generates a key as an explicit successor to an existing key. The name,
algorithm, size, and type of the key are set to match the
predecessor. The activation date of the new key is set to the
inactivation date of the existing one. The publication date is
set to the activation date minus the prepublication interval, which
defaults to 30 days.
.TP
.B \fB\-t type\fP
This option indicates the type of the key. \fBtype\fP must be one of AUTHCONF,
NOAUTHCONF, NOAUTH, or NOCONF. The default is AUTHCONF. AUTH refers
to the ability to authenticate data, and CONF to the ability to encrypt
data.
.TP
.B \fB\-v level\fP
This option sets the debugging level.
.TP
.B \fB\-V\fP
This option prints version information.
.TP
.B \fB\-y\fP
This option allows DNSSEC key files to be generated even if the key ID would
collide with that of an existing key, in the event of either key
being revoked. (This is only safe to enable if
\fI\%RFC 5011\fP trust anchor maintenance is not used with either of the keys
involved.)
.UNINDENT
.SH TIMING OPTIONS
.sp
Dates can be expressed in the format YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS. If the
argument begins with a \fB+\fP or \fB\-\fP, it is interpreted as an offset from
the present time. For convenience, if such an offset is followed by one
of the suffixes \fBy\fP, \fBmo\fP, \fBw\fP, \fBd\fP, \fBh\fP, or \fBmi\fP, then the offset is
computed in years (defined as 365 24\-hour days, ignoring leap years),
months (defined as 30 24\-hour days), weeks, days, hours, or minutes,
respectively. Without a suffix, the offset is computed in seconds. To
explicitly prevent a date from being set, use \fBnone\fP or \fBnever\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-P date/offset\fP
This option sets the date on which a key is to be published to the zone. After
that date, the key is included in the zone but is not used
to sign it. If not set, and if the \fB\-G\fP option has not been used, the
default is the current date.
.TP
.B \fB\-P sync date/offset\fP
This option sets the date on which CDS and CDNSKEY records that match this key
are to be published to the zone.
.TP
.B \fB\-A date/offset\fP
This option sets the date on which the key is to be activated. After that date,
the key is included in the zone and used to sign it. If not set,
and if the \fB\-G\fP option has not been used, the default is the current date.
.TP
.B \fB\-R date/offset\fP
This option sets the date on which the key is to be revoked. After that date, the
key is flagged as revoked. It is included in the zone and
is used to sign it.
.TP
.B \fB\-I date/offset\fP
This option sets the date on which the key is to be retired. After that date, the
key is still included in the zone, but it is not used to
sign it.
.TP
.B \fB\-D date/offset\fP
This option sets the date on which the key is to be deleted. After that date, the
key is no longer included in the zone. (However, it may remain in the key
repository.)
.TP
.B \fB\-D sync date/offset\fP
This option sets the date on which the CDS and CDNSKEY records that match this
key are to be deleted.
.TP
.B \fB\-i interval\fP
This option sets the prepublication interval for a key. If set, then the
publication and activation dates must be separated by at least this
much time. If the activation date is specified but the publication
date is not, the publication date defaults to this much time
before the activation date; conversely, if the publication date is
specified but not the activation date, activation is set to
this much time after publication.
.sp
If the key is being created as an explicit successor to another key,
then the default prepublication interval is 30 days; otherwise it is
zero.
.sp
As with date offsets, if the argument is followed by one of the
suffixes \fBy\fP, \fBmo\fP, \fBw\fP, \fBd\fP, \fBh\fP, or \fBmi\fP, the interval is
measured in years, months, weeks, days, hours, or minutes,
respectively. Without a suffix, the interval is measured in seconds.
.UNINDENT
.SH GENERATED KEY FILES
.sp
When \fBdnssec\-keyfromlabel\fP completes successfully, it prints a string
of the form \fBKnnnn.+aaa+iiiii\fP to the standard output. This is an
identification string for the key files it has generated.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnnnn\fP is the key name.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBaaa\fP is the numeric representation of the algorithm.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBiiiii\fP is the key identifier (or footprint).
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBdnssec\-keyfromlabel\fP creates two files, with names based on the
printed string. \fBKnnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key\fP contains the public key, and
\fBKnnnn.+aaa+iiiii.private\fP contains the private key.
.sp
The \fB\&.key\fP file contains a DNS KEY record that can be inserted into a
zone file (directly or with an $INCLUDE statement).
.sp
The \fB\&.private\fP file contains algorithm\-specific fields. For obvious
security reasons, this file does not have general read permission.
