Notes for BIND 9.18.15
----------------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- The :any:`max-transfer-time-in` and :any:`max-transfer-idle-in`
  statements have not had any effect since the BIND 9 networking stack
  was refactored in version 9.16. The missing functionality has been
  re-implemented and incoming zone transfers now time out properly when
  not progressing. :gl:`#4004`

- The read timeout in :iscman:`rndc` is now 60 seconds, matching the
  behavior in BIND 9.16 and earlier. It had previously been lowered to
  30 seconds by mistake. :gl:`#4046`

- When the ``ISC_R_INVALIDPROTO`` (``ENOPROTOOPT``, ``EPROTONOSUPPORT``)
  error code is returned by libuv, it is now treated as a network
  failure: the server for which that error code is returned gets marked
  as broken and is not contacted again during a given resolution
  process. :gl:`#4005`

- When removing delegations from an opt-out range, empty-non-terminal
  NSEC3 records generated by those delegations were not cleaned up. This
  has been fixed. :gl:`#4027`

- Log file rotation code did not clean up older versions of log files
  when the logging :any:`channel` had an absolute path configured as a
  ``file`` destination. This has been fixed. :gl:`#3991`

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Sending NOTIFY messages silently fails when the source port specified
  in the :any:`notify-source` statement is already in use. This can
  happen e.g. when multiple servers are configured as NOTIFY targets for
  a zone and some of them are unresponsive. This issue can be worked
  around by not specifying the source port for NOTIFY messages in the
  :any:`notify-source` statement; note that source port configuration is
  already `deprecated`_ and will be removed altogether in a future
  release. :gl:`#4002`

- See :ref:`above <relnotes_known_issues>` for a list of all known
  issues affecting this BIND 9 branch.
