 * py_syscalls.d - count Python function calls and syscalls using DTrace.
 *                 Written for the Python DTrace provider.

 * USAGE: py_syscalls.d { -p PID | -c cmd }	# hit Ctrl-C to end
 *
 * FIELDS:
 *		FILE		Filename of the Python program
 *		TYPE		Type of call (func/syscall)
 *		NAME		Name of call
 *		COUNT		Number of calls during sample
 *
 * Filename and function names are printed if available.
 * The filename for syscalls may be printed as "python", if the program
 * was invoked using the form "python filename" rather than running the
 * program with an interpreter line.
