The following is a demonstration of the dexplorer program.


Here we run dexplorer with no arguments. By default it will sample various
system activities using DTrace at 5 seconds per sample. It creates an
output tar.gz file containing all the DTrace output,

   # dexplorer
   Output dir will be the current dir (/export/home/root/DTrace/Dexplorer).
   Hit enter for yes, or type path:
   Starting dexplorer ver 0.70.
   Sample interval is 5 seconds. Total run is > 100 seconds.
     0% Interrupts by CPU...
     5% Interrupt counts...
    10% Dispatcher queue length by CPU...
    15% Sdt counts...
    20% Pages paged in by process name...
    25% Files opened count...
    30% Disk I/O size distribution by process name...

    80% Sysinfo counts by process name...
    85% New process counts with arguments...
    90% Signal counts...
    95% Syscall error counts...
   100% Done.
   File is de_jupiter_200506271803.tar.gz

As each sample is taken, a line of output is printed above. The above example
is for version 0.70, newer versions of dexplorer are likely to print more
lines as they take more samples.

The final line states which file all the output is now in.




The following displays the contents of a dexplorer file,

The following demonstrates running dexplorer in full quiet mode,

   # dexplorer -qy -d /var/tmp
   #

No text is written to the screen (-qy). The output file will have been 
put in /var/tmp (-d).
