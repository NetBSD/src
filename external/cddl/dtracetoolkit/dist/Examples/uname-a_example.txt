The following is a demonstration of the uname.d script,


Here we run the usual "uname -a" command and compare the output to that
given by the uname.d script,

   # uname -a
   SunOS jupiter 5.10 Generic i86pc i386 i86pc
   
   # ./uname-a.d
   SunOS jupiter 5.10 Generic i86pc i386 i86pc

The output is the same. uname-a.d is intended as a demonstration script,
and as a starting point for other scripts.
