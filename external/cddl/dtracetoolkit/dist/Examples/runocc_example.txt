The following are demonstrations of the runocc.d script.



Here we run it on a single CPU server that is fairly busy,

   # ./runocc.d
   
        CPU  %runocc
          0       86
   
        CPU  %runocc
          0       85
   
        CPU  %runocc
          0       82
   ^C

The run queue occupancy is around 85%, meaning most of the time there
are runnable threads queued waiting for CPU.



This script is more interesting on a multi-CPU server,

   # ./runocc.d
   
        CPU  %runocc
          1       16
          3       27
          0       38
          2       75
   
        CPU  %runocc
          0       25
          2       41
          3       42
          1       50
   
        CPU  %runocc
          3        1
          0       17
          2       26
          1       27
   
        CPU  %runocc
          3        2
          2        5
          0       24
          1       25
   ^C

Here there was some degree of saturation, especially on CPU 2 to start with.
