The following is an example of connections. As inbound TCP connections are 
established their details are printed out. This includes the UID, PID and
CMD of the server process that is listening on that port,

   # connections
     UID   PID CMD          TYPE  PORT IP_SOURCE
       0   242 inetd         tcp    79 192.168.1.1
       0   359 sshd          tcp    22 192.168.1.1
     100  1532 Xorg          tcp  6000 192.168.1.1
   ^C


In another window snoop was running for comparison,

   # snoop 'tcp[13:1] = 0x02'
   Using device /dev/rtls0 (promiscuous mode)
           mars -> jupiter      FINGER C port=56760
           mars -> jupiter      TCP D=22 S=56761 Syn Seq=3264782212 Len=0 ...
           mars -> jupiter      XWIN C port=56763

snoop can already tell me that these connections are happening - but does not
print out details of the server that accepted the connection.
