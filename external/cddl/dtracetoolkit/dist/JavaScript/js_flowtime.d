 * This traces activity from all browsers on the system that are running
 * with JavaScript provider support.
 *
 * USAGE: js_flowtime.d 	# hit Ctrl-C to end
 *
 * FIELDS:
 *		C		CPU-id
 *		TIME(us)	Time since boot, us
 *		FILE		Filename that this function belongs to
 *		DELTA(us)	Elapsed time from previous line to this line
 *		FUNC		Function name
 *
 * LEGEND:
 *		->		function entry
 *		<-		function return
 *
 * Filename and function names are printed if available.
 *
 * WARNING: Watch the first column carefully, it prints the CPU-id. If it
 * changes, then it is very likely that the output has been shuffled.
