/*
 * j_stat.d - Java operation stats using DTrace.
 *            Written for the Java hotspot DTrace provider.
 *
 * $Id: j_stat.d,v 1.1.1.1 2015/09/30 22:01:09 christos Exp $
 *
 * This traces activity from all Java processes on the system with hotspot
 * provider support (1.6.0). Method calls and object allocation are only
 * visible when using the flag "+ExtendedDTraceProbes". eg,
 * java -XX:+ExtendedDTraceProbes classfile
 *
 * USAGE: j_stat.d [interval [count]]
 *
 * FIELDS:
 *		EXEC/s		Java programs executed per second, including
 *				those without Java provider support
 *		THREAD/s	Threads created, per second
 *		METHOD/s	Methods called, per second
 *		OBJNEW/s	Objects created, per second
 *		CLOAD/s		Class loads, per second
 *		EXCP/s		Exceptions raised, per second
 *		GC/s		Garbage collects, per second
 *
 * The numbers are per second counts for the interval specified. The default 
 * interval is 1 second.
 *
 * If you see a count in "EXECS" but not in the other columns, then your
 * Java software is probably not running with the DTrace hotspot provider.
 *
 * If you see counts in "CLOAD" but not in "METHODS", then you Java
 * software probably isn't running with "+ExtendedDTraceProbes".
