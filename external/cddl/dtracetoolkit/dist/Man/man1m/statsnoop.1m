.TH statsnoop 1m  "$Date: 2015/09/30 22:01:09 $" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
statsnoop \- snoop file stats as they occur. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B statsnoop
[\-a|\-A|\-ceghsvxZ] [\-f pathname] [\-n name] [\-p PID]
.SH DESCRIPTION
statsnoop traces the stat variety of syscalls.
As a process issues a file stat, details
such as UID, PID and pathname are printed out. 

The returned file descriptor is printed,
a value of -1 indicates an error. This can be useful
for troubleshooting to determine if appliacions are attempting to
stat files that do not exist. 

Since this uses DTrace, only the root user or users with the
dtrace_kernel privilege can run this command.
