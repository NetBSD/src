xcallsbypid.d \- CPU cross calls by PID. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS

xcallsbypid.d reports the number of CPU cross calls by process name

do work on it's behalf. A great number of these can be a burden
on the system.

Since this uses DTrace, only the root user or users with the
dtrace_kernel privilege can run this command.
