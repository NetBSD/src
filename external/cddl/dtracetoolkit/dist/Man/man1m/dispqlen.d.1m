.SH NAME
dispqlen.d \- dispatcher queue length by CPU. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dispqlen.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
The dispatcher queue length is an indication of CPU saturation.
It is not an indicatior of utilisation - the CPUs may or may not be
utilised when the dispatcher queue reports a length of zero.

This script measures this activity by sampling at 1000 Hertz per CPU.

Since this uses DTrace, only the root user or users with the
dtrace_kernel privilege can run this command.
.SH OS
Solaris
.SH STABILITY
unstable - walks private kernel structs.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP

.SH DOCUMENTATION

Docs directory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked
examples with verbose descriptions explaining the output.
.SH EXIT
dispqlen.d will sample until Ctrl-C is hit.
