.SH NAME
woof.d \- Bark for new processes. Needs /dev/audio. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B woof.d &
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is an audio alert daemon for process creation. It is a virtual dog which
barks when it sees new processes. If many processes are being created
quickly, it will bark a lot (and become a nuisance - not just the noise, 
but also from consuming too much CPU).

This exists in the DTraceToolkit more for entertainment than 
practicality.

Since this uses DTrace, only the root user or users with the
dtrace_kernel privilege can run this command.
.SH OS
Solaris
.SH STABILITY
stable - needs the proc provider, /usr/bin/audioplay, and bark.au.
