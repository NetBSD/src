.SH DESCRIPTION
modcalls.d is a DTrace OneLiner to a report of the number of 
kernel function calls by module.

This script may be useful to determine whether drivers are "thinking" when
troubleshooting driver issues.

Docs/oneliners.txt and Docs/Examples/oneliners_examples.txt

to run.

Since this uses DTrace, only the root user or users with the
dtrace_kernel privilege can run this command.
