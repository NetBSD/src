.SH NAME
sh_stat.d - Bourne shell operation stats using DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sh_stat.d
[interval [count]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This traces activity from all sh processes on the system that are running
with sh provider support.

The numbers are counts for the interval specified. The default interval
is 1 second.

If you see a count in "EXECS" but not in the other columns, then sh
scripts may be running without the DTrace sh provider. See Shell/Readme.

Filename and function names are printed if available.
.SH OS
Any
.SH STABILITY
Evolving - uses the DTrace Shell provider, which may change 
as additional features are introduced. Check Shell/Readme
to see what version these scripts are based on.
