.SH NAME
dnlcstat \- DNLC statistics. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dnlcstat
[interval [count]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The DNLC is the Directory Name Lookup Cache. Filename lookups often
return a hit from here, before needing to traverse the regular file
system cache or go to disk.

Since this uses DTrace, only the root user or users with the
dtrace_kernel privilege can run this command.
