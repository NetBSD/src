.SH NAME
lockbydist.d \- lock distrib. by process name. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lockbydist.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
lockbydist.d is a DTrace OneLiner to a report the time threads have
spent blocked on adaptive mutexes, by process name. 

A distribution is printed to illustrate the number of blocks at 
different lengths in time. This helps us identify if there are many
short blocks, or fewer large blocks.

Docs/oneliners.txt and Docs/Examples/oneliners_examples.txt
in the DTraceToolkit contain this as a oneliner that can be cut-n-paste
to run.

Since this uses DTrace, only the root user or users with the
dtrace_kernel privilege can run this command.
