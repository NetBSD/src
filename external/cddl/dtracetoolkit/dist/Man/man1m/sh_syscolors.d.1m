.SH NAME
sh_syscolors.d - trace Bourne shell flow plus syscalls, in color.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sh_syscolors.d
{ \-p PID | \-c cmd }	
.SH DESCRIPTION
This watches shell function entries and returns, and indents child
function calls. Shell builtins, commands and lines are also printed.

The filename for syscalls may be printed as the shell name, if the
script was invoked using the form "shell filename" rather than running
the script with an interpreter line.
.SH OS

.SH STABILITY
