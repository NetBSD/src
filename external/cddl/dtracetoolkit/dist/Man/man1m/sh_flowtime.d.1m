.SH NAME
sh_flowtime.d - snoop Bourne shell execution with flow and delta times.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sh_flowtime.d

.SH DESCRIPTION
This traces shell activity from all Bourne shells on the system that are
running with sh provider support.

This watches shell function entries and returns, and indents child
function calls. Shell builtins are also printed.

DELTAs:
->		previous line to the start of this function
<-		previous line to the end of this function
>		previous line to the end of this builtin
|		previous line to the end of this command

See sh_flowinfo.d for more verbose and more straightforward delta times.

Filename and function names are printed if available.
