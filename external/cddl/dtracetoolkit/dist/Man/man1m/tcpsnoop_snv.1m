.SH NAME
tcpsnoop \- snoop TCP network packets by process. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tcpsnoop
[\-a|hjsvZ] [\-n name] [\-p pid]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This analyses TCP network packets and prints the responsible PID and UID,
plus standard details such as IP address and port. This captures traffic
of newly created TCP connections that were established while this program
was running. It can help identify which processes is causing TCP traffic.

Since this uses DTrace, only the root user or users with the
dtrace_kernel privilege can run this command.
