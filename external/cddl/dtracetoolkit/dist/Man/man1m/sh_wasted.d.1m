.SH NAME
sh_wasted.d - measure Bourne shell elapsed times for "wasted" commands.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sh_wasted.d
{ \-p PID | \-c cmd }	
.SH DESCRIPTION
This script measures "wasted" commands - those which are called externally
but are in fact builtins to the shell. Ever seen a script which calls
/usr/bin/echo needlessly? This script measures that cost.

Filename and call names are printed if available.
.SH OS
Any
.SH STABILITY
Evolving - uses the DTrace Shell provider, which may change 
as additional features are introduced. Check Shell/Readme
to see what version these scripts are based on.

.SH DOCUMENTATION

especially useful as they aim to demonstrate how to interpret
the output.
