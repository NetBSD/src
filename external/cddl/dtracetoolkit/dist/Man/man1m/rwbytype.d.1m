.SH NAME
rwbytype.d \- read/write bytes by vnode type. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rwbytype.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program identifies the vnode type of read/write activity - whether
that is for regular files, sockets, character special devices, etc. This
is measuring at the application level, so file activity may well be 
cached by the system.

Since this uses DTrace, only the root user or users with the
dtrace_kernel privilege can run this command.
.SH OS
Solaris
.SH STABILITY
unstable - this script uses fbt provider probes which may change for
future updates of the OS, invalidating this script. Please read
Docs/Notes/ALLfbt_notes.txt for further details about these fbt scripts.
