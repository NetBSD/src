.SH NAME
tcl_stat.d - Tcl operation stats using DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tcl_stat.d
[interval [count]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This traces activity from all Tcl processes on the system with DTrace
provider support (tcl8.4.16).

The numbers are counts for the interval specified. The default interval
is 1 second.

If you see a count in "EXECS" but not in the other columns, then you
may have older Tcl software that does not have the integrated DTrace
provider (or newer software where the provider has changed).
.SH OS
Any
.SH STABILITY
Evolving - uses the DTrace Tcl provider, which may change 
as additional features are introduced. Check Tcl/Readme
to see what version these scripts are based on.
