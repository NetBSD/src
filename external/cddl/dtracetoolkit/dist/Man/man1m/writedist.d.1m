.SH NAME
writedist.d \- write distrib. by process name. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B writedist.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
writedist.d is a DTrace OneLiner to a report the write size and
number of occurrences as a frequency distribution by process name.

This can be useful to identify the behaviour of processes
that are doing writes. Are they using many small writes, or 
fewer large writes.

Docs/oneliners.txt and Docs/Examples/oneliners_examples.txt
in the DTraceToolkit contain this as a oneliner that can be cut-n-paste
to run.

Since this uses DTrace, only the root user or users with the
dtrace_kernel privilege can run this command.
