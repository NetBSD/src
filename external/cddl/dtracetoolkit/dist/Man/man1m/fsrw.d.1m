.SH NAME
fsrw.d \- file system read/write event tracing. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fsrw.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
This traces file related activity: system call reads and writes,
vnode logical read and writes (fop), and disk I/O. It can be used
to examine the behaviour of each I/O layer, from the syscall
interface to what the disk is doing. Behaviour such as read-ahead, and
max I/O size breakup can be observed.

Since this uses DTrace, only the root user or users with the
dtrace_kernel privilege can run this command.
.SH OS

.SH STABILITY
unstable - this script uses fbt provider probes which may change for
