.SH NAME
vmstat.d \- vmstat demo in DTrace. Uses DTrace.

.B vmstat.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
This has been written to demonstrate fetching the same data as vmstat
from DTrace. This program is intended as a starting point for other
DTrace scripts, by beginning with familiar statistics.

Since this uses DTrace, only the root user or users with the
dtrace_kernel privilege can run this command.
.SH OS
Solaris
.SH STABILITY
unstable - uses various kernel symbols.
