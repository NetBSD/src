.SH NAME
whatexec.d \- Examine the type of files exec'd. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B whatexec.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
This prints the first four chacacters of files that are executed.
This traces the kernel function findexec_by_hdr(), which checks for
a known magic number in the file's header.

The idea came from a demo I heard about from the UK, where a
"blue screen of death" was displayed for "MZ" files (although I
haven't seen the script or the demo).

Since this uses DTrace, only the root user or users with the
dtrace_kernel privilege can run this command.
