.SH NAME
rb_stat.d - Ruby operation stats using DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rb_stat.d
[interval [count]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This traces activity from all Ruby programs on the system that are
running with Ruby provider support.

The numbers are counts for the interval specified. The default interval
is 1 second.

If you see a count in "EXECS" but not in the other columns, then your
Ruby software is probably not running with the DTrace Ruby provider.
See Ruby/Readme.

Filename and method names are printed if available.
.SH OS

.SH STABILITY
Evolving - uses the DTrace Ruby provider, which may change 
as additional features are introduced. Check Ruby/Readme
to see what version these scripts are based on.
