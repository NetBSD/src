shortlived.d \- check short lived process time. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B shortlived.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
shortlived.d is a DTrace program to measure the time consumed by
short lived processes. 

Many short lived processes can be a burden on the system, and may be
the cause of performance problems. This program can help identify
that case.

Since this uses DTrace, only the root user or users with the
dtrace_kernel privilege can run this command.
.SH OS

.SH STABILITY

Docs directory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked
examples with verbose descriptions explaining the output.
