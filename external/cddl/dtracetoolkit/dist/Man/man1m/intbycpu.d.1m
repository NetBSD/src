.SH NAME
intbycpu.d \- interrupts by CPU. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B intbycpu.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
intbycpu.d is based on a DTrace OneLiner to a report of the number of 
interrupts by CPU.

The intrstat(1M) command can be used for further analysis
of interrputs.

Docs/oneliners.txt and Docs/Examples/oneliners_examples.txt
in the DTraceToolkit contain this as a oneliner that can be cut-n-paste
to run.

Since this uses DTrace, only the root user or users with the
dtrace_kernel privilege can run this command.
