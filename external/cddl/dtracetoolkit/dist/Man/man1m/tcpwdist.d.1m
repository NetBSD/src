.SH NAME
tcpwdist.d \- simple TCP write dist by process. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tcpwdist.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
This measures the size of writes from applications to the TCP level, which
may well be much larger than the MTU size (this is application writes not
packet writes). It can help identify which process is creating network
traffic, and the size of the writes by that application. It uses a simple
probe that produces meaningful output for most protocols.

Tracking TCP activity by process is complex for a number of reasons,
the greatest is that inbound TCP traffic is asynchronous to the process.
The easiest TCP traffic to match is writes, which this script demonstrates.
However there are still issues - for an inbound telnet connection the
writes are associated with the command, for example "ls -l", not something
meaningful such as "in.telnetd".

Scripts that match TCP traffic properly include tcpsnoop and tcptop.

Since this uses DTrace, only the root user or users with the
dtrace_kernel privilege can run this command.
.SH OS
Solaris
.SH STABILITY
unstable - this script uses fbt provider probes which may change for
future updates of the OS, invalidating this script. Please read
Docs/Notes/ALLfbt_notes.txt for further details about these fbt scripts.
