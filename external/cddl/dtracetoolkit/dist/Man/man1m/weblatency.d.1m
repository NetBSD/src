.SH NAME
weblatency.d \- website latency statistics. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B weblatency.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
This prints statistics for hostnames that browers have set GET requests 
for, in particular latency by hostname.

The latency measured is from the browser sending the GET
request to when the browser begins to recieve the response. It
is an overall response time for the client, and encompasses
connection speed delays, DNS lookups, proxy delays, and web server
response time.

This is written as an experimental tool, and may not work at all with
your browser.

Since this uses DTrace, only the root user or users with the
dtrace_kernel privilege can run this command.
.SH OS
Solaris
.SH STABILITY
unstable - depends on browser implementation.
