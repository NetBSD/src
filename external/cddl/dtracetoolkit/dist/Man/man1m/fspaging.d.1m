.SH NAME
fspaging.d \- file system read/write and paging tracing. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fspaging.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
This traces file related activity: system call reads and writes,
vnode logical read and writes (fop), vnode putpage and getpage activity,
and disk I/O. It can be used to examine the behaviour of each I/O
layer, from the syscall interface to what the disk is doing. Behaviour
such as read-ahead, and max I/O size breakup can be observed.

This is a verbose version of fsrw.d, as this also traces paging activity.

Since this uses DTrace, only the root user or users with the
dtrace_kernel privilege can run this command.
