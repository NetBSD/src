.SH NAME
cputimes \- print time by Kernel/Idle/Process. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cputimes
[\-ahTV] [\-t top] [interval [count]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
cputimes prints the CPU time consumed by the Kernel, Idle threads and
by Processes. 

This program accurately measures time consumed by the kernel, but in
doing so creates extra kernel load of it's own. This extra kernel
activity can be measured by running one cputimes and then another, and
comparing the difference in kernel consumed time. This method can be
used to estimate the load caused by other DTrace scripts.

Since this uses DTrace, only the root user or users with the
dtrace_kernel privilege can run this command.

.SH FIELDS
.TP
THREADS
Either KERNEL, IDLE, PROCESS or process name.
.TP
IDLE
Idle time - CPU running idle thread
.TP
