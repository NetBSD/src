.SH NAME
j_stat.d - Java operation stats using DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B j_stat.d
[interval [count]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This traces activity from all Java processes on the system with hotspot
provider support (1.6.0). Method calls and object allocation are only
visible when using the flag "+ExtendedDTraceProbes". eg,
java -XX:+ExtendedDTraceProbes classfile

The numbers are counts for the interval specified. The default interval
is 1 second.

If you see a count in "EXECS" but not in the other columns, then your
Java software is probably not running with the DTrace hotspot provider.

If you see counts in "CLOAD" but not in "METHODS", then you Java
software probably isn't running with "+ExtendedDTraceProbes".
.SH OS
Solaris
.SH STABILITY
