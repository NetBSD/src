.TH cpudists 1m  "$Date: 2015/09/30 22:01:09 $" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
cpudists \- CPU distrib. by Kernel/Idle/Process. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cpudists
[\-ahV] [\-t top] [interval [count]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
cpudists prints the CPU time distributions consumed by the Kernel, 
Idle threads and by Processes. 

This program is a variant on cputimes, and creates extra kernel load as
described in cputimes(1M). cpudists prints out a distribution report
(a quantize aggregation), such that the number of occurrences and 
duration of each thread using the CPUs can be identified. 

Since this uses DTrace, only the root user or users with the
dtrace_kernel privilege can run this command.
