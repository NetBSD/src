.SH NAME
tcl_who.d - trace Tcl calls by process using DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tcl_who.d

.SH DESCRIPTION
This traces activity from all Tcl processes on the system with DTrace
provider support (tcl8.4.16).

Calls is a measure of activity, and is a count of the procedures and
commands that Tcl called.

The argument list is truncated at 55 characters (up to 80 is easily
available). To easily read the full argument list, use other system tools;
on Solaris use "pargs PID".
