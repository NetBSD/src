Man - Man pages

   There are a number of ways you can read these man pages. Either,

   1. Add this directory to your MANPATH,

	cd Man
	MANPATH=$MANPATH:$PWD
	man iosnoop

   2. If the DTraceToolkit has been installed, and that dir to your MANPATH,

	MANPATH=$MANPATH:/opt/DTT/Man
	man iosnoop

   3. Set MANPATH to "." every time you read a script,

	cd Man
	MANPATH=. man iosnoop

   4. Use the -M option to "man", if your OS has it,

	man -M Man iosnoop

   5. Prentend that you are /usr/bin/man, if your OS has nroff,

	nroff -man Man/man1m/iosnoop.1m | more

   6. Pretend that you are /usr/bin/nroff,

	more Man/man1m/iosnoop.1m

   7. Pretend that you have no pagers installed,

	while read line; do echo $line; done < Man/man1m/iosnoop.1m

   8. Pretend that you can read hex,

	od -x Man/man1m/iosnoop.1m
