 * php_flowtime.d - snoop PHP functions with flow and delta times.
 *                  Written for the PHP DTrace provider.
 *
 * $Id: php_flowtime.d,v 1.1.1.1 2015/09/30 22:01:09 christos Exp $
 *
 * This traces shell activity from PHP programs on the system that are
 * running with PHP provider support.
 *
 * USAGE: php_flowtime.d			# hit Ctrl-C to end
 *
 * This watches PHP function entries and returns, and indents child
 * function calls.
 *
 * FIELDS:
 *		C		CPU-id
 *		TIME(us)	Time since boot, us
 *		FILE		Filename that this function belongs to
 *		DELTA(us)	Elapsed time from previous line to this line
 *		FUNC		PHP function name
 *
 * LEGEND:
 *		->		function entry
 *		<-		function return
 *
 * Filename and function names are printed if available.
 *
 * WARNING: Watch the first column carefully, it prints the CPU-id. If it
 * changes, then it is very likely that the output has been shuffled.
