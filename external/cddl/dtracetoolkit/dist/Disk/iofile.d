/*
 * iofile.d - I/O wait time by filename and process.
 *            Written using DTrace (Solaris 10 3/05).
 *
 * This prints the total I/O wait times for each filename by process.
 * This can help determine why an application is performing poorly by
 * identifying which file they are waiting on, and the total times.
 * Both disk and NFS I/O are measured.

 * USAGE:	iofile.d	# wait, then hit Ctrl-C to end
 *
 * FIELDS:
 *		PID		Process ID
 *		CMD		Process name
 *		TIME		Total wait time for disk events, us
 *		FILE		File pathname
