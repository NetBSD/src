/*
 * bitesize.d - analyse disk I/O size by process.
 *              Written using DTrace (Solaris 10 3/05).
 *
 * This produces a report for the size of disk events caused by
 * processes. These are the disk events sent by the block I/O driver.
 *
 * If applications must use the disks, we generally prefer they do so
 * with large I/O sizes.
 *
 * $Id: bitesize.d,v 1.1.1.1 2015/09/30 22:01:07 christos Exp $
 *
 * USAGE:	bitesize.d	# wait several seconds, then hit Ctrl-C
 *
 * FIELDS:
 *		PID		process ID
 *		CMD		command and argument list
 *		value		size in bytes
 *		count		number of I/O operations
 *
 * NOTES:
 *
 * The application may be requesting smaller sized operations, which
 * are being rounded up to the nearest sector size or UFS block size.
 * To analyse what the application is requesting, DTraceToolkit programs
 * such as Proc/fddist may help.
