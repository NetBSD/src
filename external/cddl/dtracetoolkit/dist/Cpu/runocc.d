/*
 * runocc.d - run queue occupancy by CPU.
 *            Written using DTrace (Solaris 10 3/05).
 *
 * This prints the dispatcher run queue occupancy by CPU each second.
 * A consistant run queue occupancy is a sign of CPU saturation.
 *
 * The value is similar to that seen in "sar -q", however this is
 * calculated in a more accurate manner - sampling at 1000 Hertz.

 * USAGE:	runocc.d
 *
 * FIELDS:
 *		CPU		cpu ID
 *		%runocc		% run queue occupancy, sampled at 1000 Hertz
