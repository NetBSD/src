/*
 * tcl_who.d - trace Tcl calls by process using DTrace.
 *           Written for the Tcl DTrace provider.
 *
 * $Id: tcl_who.d,v 1.1.1.1 2015/09/30 22:01:09 christos Exp $
 *
 * This traces activity from all Tcl processes on the system with DTrace
 * provider support (tcl8.4.16).
 *
 * USAGE: tcl_who.d 		# hit Ctrl-C to end
 *
 * FIELDS:
 *		PID		Process ID of Tcl
 *		UID		User ID of the owner
 *		CALLS		Number of calls made (proc + cmd)
 *		ARGS		Process name and arguments
 *
 * Calls is a measure of activity, and is a count of the procedures and
 * commands that Tcl called.
 *
 * The argument list is truncated at 55 characters (up to 80 is easily
 * available). To easily read the full argument list, use other system tools;
 * on Solaris use "pargs PID".
