/*
 * tcl_flowtime.d - snoop Tcl execution showing procedure flow and delta times.
 *                  Written for the Tcl DTrace provider.
 *
 * $Id: tcl_flowtime.d,v 1.1.1.1 2015/09/30 22:01:09 christos Exp $
 *
 * This traces activity from all Tcl processes on the system with DTrace
 * provider support (tcl8.4.16).
 *
 * USAGE: tcl_flowtime.d		# hit Ctrl-C to end
 *
 * This watches Tcl method entries and returns, and indents child
 * method calls.
 *
 * FIELDS:
 *		C		CPU-id
 *		PID		Process ID
 *		TIME(us)	Time since boot, us
 *		DELTA(us)	Elapsed time from previous line to this line
 *		CALL		Tcl command or procedure name
 *
 * LEGEND:
 *		->		procedure entry
 *		<-		procedure return
 *		 >		command entry
 *		 <		command return
 *
 * WARNING: Watch the first column carefully, it prints the CPU-id. If it
 * changes, then it is very likely that the output has been shuffled.
