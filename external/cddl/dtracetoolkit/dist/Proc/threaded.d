 * threaded.d - sample multi-threaded CPU usage.

 * This measures thread IDs as a process runs across multiple CPUs.
 * It is a simple script that can help determine if a multi-threaded
 * application is effectively using it's threads, or if the threads have
 * serialised. See the example file in Docs/Examples/threaded_example.txt
 * for a demonstration.
