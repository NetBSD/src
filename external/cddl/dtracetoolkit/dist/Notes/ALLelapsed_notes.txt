* What is "elapsed" time?

Elapsed time is the absolute time from one point to another. This time
includes everything that happened between these points, including 
off-CPU time due to other system events such as I/O, scheduling,
interrupts, etc. It also includes the small overheads of DTrace itself.

Elapsed times are useful for identifying where latencies are, since
regardless of their nature (CPU, I/O, ...), they will be visible in
elapsed time.

Since elapsed times don't filter out anything, they are suseptible to
"noise" - random system events that are unrelated to the analysis target.
For that reason, it may be best to take several measurements of elapsed
time and take the average (or run your workload several times and let
DTrace take the average).

See Notes/ALLoncpu_notes.txt for a description of a different time
measurement, "on-CPU" time.


* How is "elapsed" time measured?

In DTrace, the following template provides elapsed time as "this->elapsed",

   <start-probe>
   {
	   self->start = timestamp;
   }
   
   <end-probe>
   {
	   this->elapsed = timestamp - self->start;
	   self->start = 0;
	   ...
   }
