* What is "on-CPU" time?

This is the time that a thread spent running on a CPU. It does not include
time spent off-CPU time such as sleeping for I/O or waiting for scheduling.

On-CPU times are useful for showing who is causing the CPUs to be busy,
since they measure how much CPU time has been consumed by that thread.

On-CPU times are also less susceptible to system "noise" than elapsed times,
since much of the noise will be filtered out. DTrace itself also tries
to subtract the small overheads of DTrace from the on-CPU time, to improve
the accuracy of this time.

See Notes/ALLelapsed_notes.txt for a description of a different time
measurement, "elapsed" time.


* How is "on-CPU" time measured?

In DTrace, the following template provides on-CPU time as "this->oncpu",

   <start-probe>
   {
	   self->vstart = vtimestamp;
   }
   
   <end-probe>
   {
	   this->oncpu = vtimestamp - self->vstart;
	   self->vstart = 0;
	   ...
   }
