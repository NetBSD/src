Notes - Discussion about tools and their output

   This directory contains files that provide deeper discussions about
   tools and their output.

   Files are either named,

	ALL*_notes.txt	- notes that cover a collection of tools
	*_notes.txt	- notes that cover a specific tool

   These files are exist as an informal place to dump "stuff". This might
   range from caveats to bear in mind when interpreting tool output, to
   general or bizzare knowledge. Tool documentation is placed in,

	/Man		- formal man pages
	/Examples	- demos and how to read the output
	*.d		- implementation notes within the code itself
	/Notes		- everything else

   Many of the scripts and man pages refer to files in this directory.
