* I see "drops"

If you see the following output,
   
   dtrace: 2547 drops on CPU 0

This means that JVM events (usually methods) were executed too quickly for
DTrace to keep up, and as a safety measure DTrace has let events slip by.
This means, at least, that the output is missing lines. At worst, the
output may contain corrupted values (time deltas between events that were
dropped).

If you see drops, you should first ask yourself whether you need to be
tracing such frequent events at all - is there another way to get the same
data?  For example, see the j_profile.d script, which uses a different
technique (sampling) than most of the other Java scripts (tracing).

You can try tweaking DTrace tunables to prevent DTrace from dropping events.
A key tunable is "bufsize", and can be set in scripts like so,

   #pragma D option bufsize=32m

That line means that 32 Mbytes will be allocated to the DTrace primary
buffer per-CPU (how depends on bufpolicy). If you have many CPUs, say 8,
then the above line means that 256 Mbytes (32 * 8) will be allocated as a
buffer while your D script is running.
