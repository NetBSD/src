 * pl_flowinfo.d - snoop Perl subroutine flow with info using DTrace.
 *                 Written for the Perl DTrace provider.
 *
 * $Id: pl_flowinfo.d,v 1.1.1.1 2015/09/30 22:01:09 christos Exp $
 *
 * This traces activity from all Perl programs on the system that are
 * running with Perl provider support.
 *
 * USAGE: pl_flowinfo.d 	# hit Ctrl-C to end
 *
 * FIELDS:
 *		C		CPU-id
 *		PID		Process ID
 *		DELTA(us)	Elapsed time from previous line to this line
 *		FILE		Filename of the Perl program
 *		LINE		Line number of filename
 *		TYPE		Type of call (sub)
 *		SUB		Perl subroutine
 *
 * LEGEND:
 *		->		subroutine entry
 *		<-		subroutine return
 *
 * Filename and subroutine names are printed if available.
 *
 * WARNING: Watch the first column carefully, it prints the CPU-id. If it
 * changes, then it is very likely that the output has been shuffled.
