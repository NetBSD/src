 * sh_cpudist.d - measure Bourne shell on-CPU times for types of operation.
 *                Written for the sh DTrace provider.

 *
 * This traces shell activity from all Bourne shells on the system that are
 * running with sh provider support.
 *
 * USAGE: sh_cpudist.d 		# hit Ctrl-C to end
 *
 * This script prints distribution plots of on-CPU time for shell
 * operations. Use sh_cputime.d for summary reports.
 *
 * FIELDS:
 *		1		Filename of the shell or shellscript
 *		2		Type of call (func/builtin/cmd)
 *		3		Name of call
 *
 * Filename and call names are printed if available.
