/*
 * rb_stat.d - Ruby operation stats using DTrace.
 *             Written for the Ruby DTrace provider.
 *
 * $Id: rb_stat.d,v 1.1.1.1 2015/09/30 22:01:07 christos Exp $
 *
 * This traces activity from all Ruby programs on the system that are
 * running with Ruby provider support.
 *
 * USAGE: rb_stat.d [interval [count]]
 *
 * FIELDS:
 *		EXEC/s		Ruby programs executed per second, including
 *				those without Ruby provider support
 *		METHOD/s	Methods called, per second
 *		OBJNEW/s	Objects created, per second
 *		OBJFRE/s	Objects freed, per second
 *		RAIS/s		Raises, per second
 *		RESC/s		Rescues, per second
 *		GC/s		Garbage collects, per second
 *
 * The numbers are counts for the interval specified. The default interval
 * is 1 second.
 *
 * If you see a count in "EXECS" but not in the other columns, then your
 * Ruby software is probably not running with the DTrace Ruby provider.
 * See Ruby/Readme.
 *
 * Filename and method names are printed if available.
