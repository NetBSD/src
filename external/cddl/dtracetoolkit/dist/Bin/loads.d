/*
 * loads.d - print load averages. Written using DTrace (Solaris 10 3/05).
 *
 * These are the same load averages that the "uptime" command prints.
 * The purpose of this script is to demonstrate fetching these values
 * from the DTrace language.
 *
 * $Id: loads.d,v 1.1.1.1 2015/09/30 22:01:07 christos Exp $
 *
 * USAGE:	loads.d
 *
 * SEE ALSO:	uptime(1)
 *
 * The first field is the 1 minute average, the second is the 5 minute,
 * and the third is the 15 minute average. The value represents the average
 * number of runnable threads in the system, a value higher than your
 * CPU (core/hwthread) count may be a sign of CPU saturation.
