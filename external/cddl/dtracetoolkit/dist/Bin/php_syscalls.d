 * php_syscalls.d - count PHP function calls and syscalls using DTrace.
 *                  Written for the PHP DTrace provider.

 * This traces syscalls that occured during a PHP function call.
 *
 * $Id: php_syscalls.d,v 1.1.1.1 2015/09/30 22:01:06 christos Exp $
 *
 * USAGE: php_syscalls.d 	# hit Ctrl-C to end
 *
 * FIELDS:
 *		PID		Process ID
 *		FILE		Filename of the PHP program
 *		TYPE		Type of call (func/syscall)
 *		NAME		Name of call
 *		COUNT		Number of calls during sample
 *
 * Filename and function names are printed if available.
 * The filename for syscalls may be printed as "php", if the program
