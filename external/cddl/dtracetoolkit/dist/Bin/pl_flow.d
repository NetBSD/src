 * pl_flow.d - snoop Perl execution showing subroutine flow.
 *             Written for the Solaris Perl DTrace provider.
 *
 * $Id: pl_flow.d,v 1.1.1.1 2015/09/30 22:01:07 christos Exp $
 *
 * This traces Perl activity from all Perl programs on the system
 * running with Perl provider support.
 *
 * USAGE: pl_flow.d			# hit Ctrl-C to end
 *
 * This watches Perl subroutine entries and returns, and indents child
 * subroutine calls.
 *
 * FIELDS:
 *		C		CPU-id
 *		TIME(us)	Time since boot, us
 *		FILE		Filename that this subroutine belongs to
 *		SUB		Subroutine name
 *
 * LEGEND:
 *		->		subroutine entry
 *		<-		subroutine return
 *
 * WARNING: Watch the first column carefully, it prints the CPU-id. If it
 * changes, then it is very likely that the output has been shuffled.
