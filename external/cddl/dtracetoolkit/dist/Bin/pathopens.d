/*
 * pathopens.d - full pathnames opened successfully count.
 *               Written using DTrace (Solaris 10 3/05)
 *
 * This program prints a count of the number of times files have been
 * successfully opened. This is somewhat special in that the full pathname
 * is calculated, even if the file open referred to a relative pathname.

 * USAGE:	fileopens.d
 *
 * FIELDS:
 *		PATHNAME	full pathname
 *		COUNT		number of successful opens
 *
 * Similar to a script from DExplorer.
