/*
 * whatexec.d - Examine the type of files exec'd.
 *              Written using DTrace (Solaris 10 3/05)
 *
 * This prints the first four chacacters of files that are executed.
 * This traces the kernel function findexec_by_hdr(), which checks for
 * a known magic number in the file's header.
 *
 * The idea came from a demo I heard about from the UK, where a
 * "blue screen of death" was displayed for "MZ" files (although I
 * haven't seen the script or the demo).
 *
 * $Id: whatexec.d,v 1.1.1.1 2015/09/30 22:01:07 christos Exp $
 *
 * USAGE:	whatexec.d	(early release, check for updates)
 *
 * FIELDS:
 *		PEXEC		parent command name
 *		EXEC		pathname to file exec'd
 *		OK		is type runnable, Y/N
 *		TYPE		first four characters from file
