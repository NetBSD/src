 * rb_flowtime.d - snoop Ruby function (method) flow using DTrace.
 *                 Written for the Ruby DTrace provider.
 *
 * $Id: rb_flowtime.d,v 1.1.1.1 2015/09/30 22:01:07 christos Exp $
 *
 * This traces activity from all Ruby programs on the system that are
 * running with Ruby provider support.
 *
 * USAGE: rb_flowtime.d 	# hit Ctrl-C to end
 *
 * FIELDS:
 *		C		CPU-id
 *		TIME(us)	Time since boot, us
 *		FILE		Filename that this method belongs to
 *		DELTA(us)	Elapsed time from previous line to this line
 *		CLASS::METHOD	Ruby class and method name
 *
 * LEGEND:
 *		->		method entry
 *		<-		method return
 *
 * Filename and method names are printed if available.
 *
 * WARNING: Watch the first column carefully, it prints the CPU-id. If it
 * changes, then it is very likely that the output has been shuffled.
