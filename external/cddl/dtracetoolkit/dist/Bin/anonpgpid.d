/*
 * anonpgpid.d - anonymous memory paging info by process on CPU.
 *               Written using DTrace (Solaris 10 3/05).
 *
 * This scripts may help identify which processes are affected by a system
 * with low memory, which is paging to the physical swap device. A report
 * of the process on the CPU when paging occured is printed.
 *
 * $Id: anonpgpid.d,v 1.1.1.1 2015/09/30 22:01:07 christos Exp $
 *
 * USAGE:	anonpgpid.d 	# hit Ctrl-C to end
 *
 * FIELDS:
 *		PID		Process ID
 *		CMD		Process name
 *		D		Direction, Read or Write
 *		BYTES		Total bytes during sample
 *
 * NOTES:
 *
 * This program is currently an approximation - often the process when writing
 * pages to swap will be "pageout" the pageout scanner, or "rcapd" the
 * resource capping daemon.
