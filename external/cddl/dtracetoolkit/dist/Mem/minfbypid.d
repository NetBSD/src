 * minfbypid.d - minor faults by PID.
 *               Written using DTrace (Solaris 10 3/05)
 *
 * This program prints a report of minor faults by PID. Minor faults are
 * an indiction of memory consumption. This script could be used to help
 * determine which process was consuming the most memory during the sample.

 *
 * FIELDS:
