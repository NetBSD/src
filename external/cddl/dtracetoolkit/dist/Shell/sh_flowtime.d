/*
 * sh_flowtime.d - snoop Bourne shell execution with flow and delta times.
 *                 Written for the sh DTrace provider.
 *
 * $Id: sh_flowtime.d,v 1.1.1.1 2015/09/30 22:01:09 christos Exp $
 *
 * This traces shell activity from all Bourne shells on the system that are
 * running with sh provider support.
 *
 * USAGE: sh_flowtime.d			# hit Ctrl-C to end
 *
 * This watches shell function entries and returns, and indents child
 * function calls. Shell builtins are also printed.
 *
 * FIELDS:
 *		C		CPU-id
 *		TIME(us)	Time since boot, us
 *		FILE		Filename that this function belongs to
 *		NAME		Shell function or builtin name
 *
 * LEGEND:
 *		->		function entry
 *		<-		function return
 *		 >		builtin
 *		 |		external command
 *
 * DELTAs:
 *		->		previous line to the start of this function
 *		<-		previous line to the end of this function
 *		>		previous line to the end of this builtin
 *		|		previous line to the end of this command
 *
 * See sh_flowinfo.d for more verbose and more straightforward delta times.
 *
 * Filename and function names are printed if available.
 *
 * WARNING: Watch the first column carefully, it prints the CPU-id. If it
 * changes, then it is very likely that the output has been shuffled.
