/*
 * fsrw.d - file system read/write event tracing.
 *          Written using DTrace (Solaris 10 3/05)
 *
 * This traces file related activity: system call reads and writes,
 * vnode logical read and writes (fop), and disk I/O. It can be used
 * to examine the behaviour of each I/O layer, from the syscall
 * interface to what the disk is doing. Behaviour such as read-ahead, and
 * max I/O size breakup can be observed.

 *
 * USAGE:	fsrw.d
 *
 * FIELDS:
 *		Event		Traced event (see EVENTS below)
 *		Device		Device, for disk I/O
 *		RW		Either Read or Write
 *		Size		Size of I/O in bytes
 *		Offset		Offset of I/O in kilobytes
 *		Path		Path to file on disk
 *
 * EVENTS:
 *		sc-read		System call read
 *		sc-write	System call write
 *		fop_read	Logical read
 *		fop_write	Logical write
 *		disk_io		Physical disk I/O
 *		disk_ra		Physical disk I/O, read ahead
 *
 * The events are drawn with a level of indentation, which can sometimes
 * help identify related events.
