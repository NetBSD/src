 * rfileio.d - read file I/O stats, with cache miss rate.
 *             Written using DTrace (Solaris 10 3/05)
 *
 * This script provides statistics on the number of reads and the bytes
 * read from filesystems (logical), and the number of bytes read from
 * disk (physical). A summary is printed every five seconds by file.
 *
 * A total miss-rate is also provided for the file system cache.
