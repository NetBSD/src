Snippits - DTrace code snippits

   This directory has useful snippits of D scripting in seperate files.

   When coding in DTrace, I frequently refer to the same chunks of code
   from the same scripts, when I need to do certain things that I have
   solved in the past. I also refer other people to them when asked.
   This directory is a library for such "snippits" of code.

   This directory does not contain runnable DTrace scripts.
