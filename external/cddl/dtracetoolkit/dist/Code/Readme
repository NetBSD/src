Code - Example Programs

   This directory contains example software sorted by language, which may
   be used as the target for DTrace scripts. These examples are simple and
   to the point, and are intended as example targets for when learing
   DTrace.

   Some people attempt to learn DTrace by tracing their complex real
   world application first. That's the hard way. Try these programs instead,
   and once you are confident here, move onto harder targets.

   Some of these programs feature in the example files in the /Examples
   directory.

   This directory does not contain DTrace scripts.
