In many cases, in order to get interesting or in-depth results the 
ExtendedDTraceProbes flag needs to be set when DTracing Java programs.  In
this case, because of the probes we have chosen to trace, running the program
Code/Java/Func_abc, both with (PID 311517) and without (311526) this flag, 
and we can see that it has made no difference, with each reporting 35 lines 
executed.
