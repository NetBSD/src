This is an example of the kill.d DTrace script,

   # kill.d
    FROM      COMMAND   SIG TO     RESULT   
    2344         bash     2 3117   0
    2344         bash     9 12345  -1
   ^C

In the above output, a kill -2 (Ctrl-C) was sent from the bash command
to PID 3177. Then a kill -9 (SIGKILL) was sent to PID 12345 - which 
returned a "-1" for failure.
