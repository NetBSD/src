The following is a demonstration of the xvmstat program.


Here we run it with no arguments. It will default to 1 second samples, and
will run forever,

  # xvmstat
  w   swap  free   re maj   mf cow pro  sr epi epo epf api apo apf fpi fpo fpf

Both "swap" and "free" are in units of megabytes, the rest are in units of
pages. "maj" is major faults - a useful addition to the output.

There is no summary since boot line, as this program in not using the
Kstat data.



The following runs xvmstat with a 5 second interval,

  # xvmstat 5
  w   swap  free    re maj   mf cow pro  sr epi epo epf api apo apf fpi fpo fpf

The values from "re" to "fpf" are per second values.
