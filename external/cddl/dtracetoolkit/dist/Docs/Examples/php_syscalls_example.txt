The following are examples of php_syscalls.d.

This is a simple script to count executed PHP functions and system calls.
Here it traces an example program, Code/Php/func_abc.php

# php_syscalls.d 
Tracing... Hit Ctrl-C to end.
^C
 PID     FILE                       TYPE       NAME                      COUNT
 18419   func_abc.php               func       func_a                        1
 18419   func_abc.php               func       func_b                        1
 18419   func_abc.php               func       func_c                        1
 18419   func_abc.php               func       sleep                         3
 18419   httpd                      syscall    nanosleep                     3

While tracing, four functions were called - func_a(), func_b(), func_c(), and
sleep.  There were also three instances of the system call nanosleep().

This script can provide an insight to how a PHP application is interacting
with the system, by providing both application function calls and system calls 
in the same output.
