The following are demonstrations of the rfileio.d script.


rfileio.d prints file system statistics by file,

   # ./rfileio.d
   
   Read IOPS, top 20 (count)
   /lib/ld.so.1                                              logical          2

   /devices/pseudo/clone@0:ptm                               logical         92
   /lib/ld.so.1                                              logical        212
   /usr/bin/grep                                             logical        269
   /extra1/contents                                         physical   48115712
   /extra1/contents                                          logical   94865162
   
   Total File System miss-rate: 50%
   ^C

   $ ls -l /extra1/contents
   -rw-r--r--   1 root     root     94865162 Nov  2 21:08 /extra1/contents

The /extra1/contents file was read using the grep command. The output shows
that half of the contents was returned from the cache, the other half from disk
(50% miss-rate). It is 94,865,162 bytes in size, which can be seen both in
the ls -l output and the logical read() bytes reported by rfileio.d. There
were 11,582 logical read() calls, which the disk driver satisfied by using
1,700 disk events (aggregation).



The following demonstrates many files being read.

   Total File System miss-rate: 81%
   ^C

The miss-rate was 81%, meaning we are returning around 20% of the data from
the cache. Details for the top 20 files read by-bytes and by-count are listed;
this shows the /usr/bin/amd64/mdb file was read() 63 times, causing 15 disk
reads, and while 627,456 bytes were requested, 638,976 bytes were read from 
disk (the extra bytes are due to read-ahead and file system metadata).
