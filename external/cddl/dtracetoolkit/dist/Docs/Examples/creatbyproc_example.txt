The following is an example of the creatbyproc.d script,


Here we run creatbyproc.d for several seconds,

   # ./creatbyproc.d
   dtrace: script './creatbyproc.d' matched 2 probes
   CPU     ID                    FUNCTION:NAME
     0   5438                    creat64:entry touch /tmp/newfile
     0   5438                    creat64:entry sh /tmp/mpLaaOik
     0   5438                    creat64:entry sh /dev/null
   ^C

In another window, the following commands were run,

	touch /tmp/newfile
	man ls

The file creation activity caused by these commands can be seen in the
output by creatbyproc.d
