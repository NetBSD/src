The following is a demonstration of the guess.d script,


guess.d is a guessing game written in DTrace. It goes like this,

   # ./guess.d
   guess.d - Guess a number between 1 and 100
   
   Enter guess 1: 50
   Lower...
   Enter guess 2: 25
   Higher...
   Enter guess 3: 37
   Higher...
   Enter guess 4: 44
   Higher...
   Enter guess 5: 48
   Lower...
   Enter guess 6: 46
   Lower...
   Enter guess 7: 45
   Correct! That took 7 guesses.

It was written as a demonstration of the same code written in dozens of
languages. It makes a good demonstration, as it covers integer and string
variables, conditional statements, loops, keyboard input, screen output,
and file input and output. 

Written in DTrace however, is not such a good demonstration! DTrace doesn't
have loops (it doesn't really need them either) which made the code a 
little odd. DTrace also doesn't have keyboard input... So this script is
somewhat amusing as an example, but not terribly useful.
