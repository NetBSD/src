Here we run it for a few seconds then hit Ctrl-C,

   # inttimes.d

        DEVICE           TIME (ns)
          ata0              22324
         uhci1              45893
          ata1             138559

         rtls0            2540175

In the above output, we can see that the rtls0 driver spent 2540 us on the
CPU servicing interrupts, while ata0 spent only 22 us.
