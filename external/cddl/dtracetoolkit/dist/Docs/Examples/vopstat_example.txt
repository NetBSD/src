The following are demonstrations of the vopstat script.


By default, vopstat traces activity at the vnode interface and prints
summaries every five seconds. It will either trace all filesystems or
just the mountpoint specified.

Here it was run on /extra1, while a tar command archived /extra1,

   # ./vopstat /extra1

There were 66 calls for physical I/O operations, fop_getpage, as files
were read from disk. The VOP Count show that there were many calls to
fop_putpage and fop_getpage, as tar works its way through files; and 
many more to fop_dispose. The total elaspsed time for these calls
are listed at the bottom, in milleseconds.

This rate of events will put some pressure on the DTrace buffer,
you may see dynamic variable drops.



vopstat also has a -t option to trace activity. Here it is run on /extra1 
while an "ls" command listed files from that directory,

# ./vopstat -t /extra1
