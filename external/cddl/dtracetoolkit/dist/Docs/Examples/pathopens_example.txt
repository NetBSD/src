The following is a demonstration of the pathopens.d script,


Here we run it for a few seconds then hit Ctrl-C,

   # pathopens.d
   Tracing... Hit Ctrl-C to end.
   ^C
    COUNT PATHNAME
        1 /lib/libcmd.so.1
        1 /export/home/root/DTrace/Dexplorer/dexplorer
        1 /lib/libmd5.so.1
        1 /lib/libaio.so.1
        1 /lib/librt.so.1
        1 /etc/security/prof_attr
        1 /etc/mnttab
        2 /devices/pseudo/devinfo@0:devinfo
        2 /dev/kstat
        2 /lib/libnvpair.so.1
        2 /lib/libkstat.so.1
        2 /lib/libdevinfo.so.1
        2 /lib/libnsl.so.1

        8 /export/home/brendan/Utils_solx86/setiathome-3.08.i386-pc-solaris2.6/outfile.sah

In the above output, many of the files would have been opened using 
absolute pathnames. However the "dexplorer" file was opened using a relative
pathname - and the pathopens.d script has correctly printed the full path.

The above shows that the outfile.sah file was opened successfully 8 times.
