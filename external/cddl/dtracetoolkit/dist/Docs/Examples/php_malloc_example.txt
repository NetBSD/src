Following are examples of running php_malloc.d.

Here it is running on Code/Php/func_abc.php

   # php_malloc.d -p 18523
   Tracing... Hit Ctrl-C to end.
   ^C
   
   PHP malloc byte distributions by engine caller,
   
   
   PHP malloc byte distributions by PHP file and function,


Theoretically this should show you mallocs.  However there weren't any in this
example.  The rest of these example files would have been so much easier to
write if they were all like this.  I would have been finished by now and would
have been flicking through the TV channels with a nice, cold beer in hand.


... Fixing this example is on my todo list.  Check for newer versions of the
toolkit.
