The following is an example of the udpstat.d script,



Here we run udpstat for a few seconds. Firstly, we run a "spray" command
outbound, followed by a spray inbound. Both can be identified in the 
output below,

   # udpstat.d
       UDP_out  UDP_outErr      UDP_in   UDP_inErr  UDP_noPort
             0           0           0           0           1
             0           0           0           0           2
             0           0           0           0           0
          1165           0           2           0           0
             0           0           0           0           0
             0           0           0           0           2
             3           0        1166           0           1
             0           0           0           0           0
             0           0           0           0           0
             0           0           0           0           0

Here we run udpstat.d while an outbound DNS lookup is performed using
"nslookup",

   # udpstat.d
       UDP_out  UDP_outErr      UDP_in   UDP_inErr  UDP_noPort
             0           0           0           0           1
             0           0           0           0           1
             1           0           1           0           0
             0           0           0           0           0
             0           0           0           0           3
   ^C

Little output is observed as this tracks datagrams not bytes. There is 
one outbound and one inbound datagram.
