The following is a demonstration of the loads.d script.


Here we run both loads.d and the uptime command for comparison,

   # uptime
     1:30am  up 14 day(s),  2:27,  3 users,  load average: 3.52, 3.45, 3.05

   # ./loads.d
   2005 Jun 11 01:30:49,  load average: 3.52, 3.45, 3.05

Both have returned the same load average, confirming that loads.d is
behaving as expected.


The point of loads.d is to demonstrate fetching the same data as uptime
does, in the DTrace language. It is not intended as a replacement
or substitute to the uptime(1) command.
