The following examples are the results of running the js_who.d script while
various JavaScript events happen.

A JavaScript program that behaves like a clock is frequently used by these
examples, since it can be left running in the background without browser
input. Browser input, such as hitting the reload button or using menus,
triggers many other JavaScript events since much of the browser uses
JavaScript. This makes for interesting longer examples, but would be
overwhelming for example #1.

In the first example, we can see what happens when we run this program,
Code/JavaScript/func_clock.html

# js_who.d 
Tracing... Hit Ctrl-C to end.
^C
      PID    UID  FUNCS FILE
    10530    100     18 file:///export/home/brendan/Lang/JavaScript/func_clock.html


The second example is more complex, the reason for this is that the program
Code/Javascript/func_slow.html was loaded in the browser, and the reload
button was pressed.  This output captured the many browser events that occured
when moving the mouse pointer to do so.

# js_who.d 
Tracing... Hit Ctrl-C to end.
^C
      PID    UID  FUNCS FILE
