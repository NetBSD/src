The following are examples of pl_subcalls.d.

This is a simple script to count executed Perl subroutines. Here it traces
an example program, Code/Perl/func_abc.pl.

   # pl_subcalls.d 
   Tracing... Hit Ctrl-C to end.
   ^C
    FILE                             SUB                                 CALLS
    func_abc.pl                      func_a                                  1
    func_abc.pl                      func_b                                  1
    func_abc.pl                      func_c                                  1

While tracing, func_a() from the program "func_abc.pl" was executed once,
along with func_b() and func_c().



The following traces a Perl network interface statistics tool, "nicstat"

The number of subroutines called by nicstat can be seen above, which includes
subroutines from libraries and modules that the program used.
