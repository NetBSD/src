The following explains how to demonstrate the woof.d DTrace script.

This script is only useful if you have an audio device, /dev/audio. To test
audio, you can run:

	$ audioplay /usr/share/audio/samples/au/sample.au

The volume can be adjusted from a few tools, including,

	$ /usr/dt/bin/sdtaudiocontrol

...

woof.d will bark whenever a new process is created. In order to demonstrate
it, first run the following:

	# ./woof.d &

You have now installed the dog (if the dog becomes a nusience, you are
allowed to kill it). Now compare the difference between these recursive
grep commands:

	$ find /etc -type f -exec grep localhost {} \;

	$ find /etc -type f -exec grep localhost {} +

The first find command is the "bad way", the second is the "good way". You
will hear for yourself why this is the case.
