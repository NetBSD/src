The following is a demonstration of the sigdist.d script.


Here we run sigdist.d, and in another window we kill -9 a sleep process,

   # ./sigdist.d
   Tracing... Hit Ctrl-C to end.
   ^C
             SENDER        RECIPIENT    SIG  COUNT
              sched           dtrace      2      1
              sched             bash     18      1
               bash            sleep      9      1
              sched             Xorg     14     55

We can see the signal sent from bash to sleep. We can also see that Xorg
has recieved 55 signal 14s. a "man -s3head signal" may help explain what
signal 14 is (alarm clock).
