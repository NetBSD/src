The following are examples of sh_calls.d.

This is a simple script to count Bourne shell calls. Here it traces an
example program, Code/Perl/func_abc.sh.

   # sh_calls.d 
   Tracing... Hit Ctrl-C to end.
   ^C
    FILE                   TYPE       NAME                                COUNT
    func_abc.sh            func       func_a                                  1
    func_abc.sh            func       func_b                                  1
    func_abc.sh            func       func_c                                  1
    func_abc.sh            builtin    echo                                    3
    func_abc.sh            cmd        sleep                                   3

While tracing, function func_a() from the program "func_abc.sh" was executed
once, along with func_b() and func_c(). The "echo" builtin was called 3
times, as was the "sleep" command.


The following traced the firefox start script,

The firefox start script called run-mozilla.sh, which can be seen both
as a "cmd" call in the above output from the "firefox" script, and as
additionall calls from the "run-mozilla.sh" script.

The builtin called "[" is the test builtin, and was called 20 times by
"run-mozilla.sh" and 18 times by "firefox". The "firefox" script also called
20 subshells.
