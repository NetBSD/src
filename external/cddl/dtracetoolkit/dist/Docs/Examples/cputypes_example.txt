The following are demonstrations of the cputypes.d script,


This is running cputypes.d on a desktop,

   # cputypes.d
    CPU CHIP PSET LGRP  CLOCK  TYPE             FPU
      0    0    0    0    867  i386             i387 compatible

fairly boring.



The following is a multi CPU x86 server,

   # cputypes.d
    CPU CHIP PSET LGRP  CLOCK  TYPE             FPU
      0    0    0    0   2791  i386             i387 compatible
      1    3    1    0   2791  i386             i387 compatible
      2    0    0    0   2791  i386             i387 compatible
      3    3    0    0   2791  i386             i387 compatible

Much more interesting! We can see from the CHIP field that there is actually
two CPUs, each with two cores. There is also two processor sets (0, 1).

The CPUs were printed in CPU id order by mere chance.



Here is a multi CPU SPARC server,

   # cputypes.d
    CPU CHIP PSET LGRP  CLOCK  TYPE             FPU
      0    0    0    0    400  sparcv9          sparcv9
      1    1    0    0    400  sparcv9          sparcv9
      4    4    0    0    400  sparcv9          sparcv9
      5    5    0    0    400  sparcv9          sparcv9
