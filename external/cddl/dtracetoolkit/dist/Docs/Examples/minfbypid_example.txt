The following is a demonstration of the minfbypid.d script,


Here we run it for a few seconds then hit Ctrl-C,

   # minfbypid.d
   Tracing... Hit Ctrl-C to end.
   ^C
      PID CMD                     MINFAULTS
    11021 dtrace                         54
    11023 ls                             56
    11024 df                             57
    11023 bash                           75
    11022 bash                           75
    11024 bash                           76
    11022 find                           91

In the above output, we can see that each of the bash shells had about 75
minor faults each. Minor faults are an indication of memory consumption.
