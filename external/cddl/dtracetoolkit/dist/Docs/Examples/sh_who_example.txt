These are examples of the results after running the sh_who.d script. 

This script shows which UIDs and PIDs are running shell scripts, and how 
active they are.  It measures the number of lines executed according to 
the line probe - which is a useful, but rough measure of shell activity.

Here it runs as a script executes three times.

# sh_who.d

^C
      PID    UID  LINES FILE
    13663      0      9 ./func_abc.sh
    13667      0      9 ./func_abc.sh
    13671      0      9 ./func_abc.sh

We see func_abc.sh ran three seperate times, each with nine lines of shell 
activity.


Here we trace an instance of starting Mozilla Firefox.

# sh_who.d

    13678    100      1 firefox

    13680    100      1 firefox

    13693    100      1 /usr/lib/firefox/run-mozilla.sh
    13694    100      1 /usr/lib/firefox/run-mozilla.sh
    13695    100      1 /usr/lib/firefox/run-mozilla.sh
    13692    100     55 /usr/lib/firefox/run-mozilla.sh
    13677    100     75 firefox

Firefox itself (PID 13677) ran 75 lines of code.  There are also instances of 
firefox running a single line of code with a different PID each time.  These 
are probably calls to subshells.  Use the sh provider to confirm.
