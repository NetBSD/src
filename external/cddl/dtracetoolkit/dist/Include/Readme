Include - include scripts for D scripting

   This directory contains files that can be included for use with D scripts.

   There are two types of include files,

   *.h
	These can be included using,

	#!/usr/sbin/dtrace -Cs
	#include <filename.h>

   *.d
	These must be copyied to a translator directory (/usr/lib/dtrace),
	and should be automatically pulled in.

   This directory does not contain runnable DTrace scripts.
