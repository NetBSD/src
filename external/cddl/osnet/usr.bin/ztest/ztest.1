.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility stress tests the DMU, ZAP, SPA components of ZFS from user space.
.Pp
.Nm
provides a simple routine to test the functionality of a component task.
These simple routines can then be used to stress test through parallel
execution.
Tests are run as child processes of the main process.
.Pp
The checksum and compression functions are changed each time a dataset is
opened to introduce varying combinations of checksum and compression from block
to block among objects.
.Pp
While tests are running, faults are injected into the pool to verify
self-healing ability.
.Pp
To verify that the on-disk consistency is never lost after a crash, child
processes are killed at random with a SIGKILL signal, after which the parent
process invokes a new child to run the test again on the same storage pool.
.Pp
Many of the tests record the transaction group number as part of their data.
When reading old data, tests verify that the transaction group number is less
than the current, open state, transaction group to ensure the consistency of
tests and detect unaccounted changes.
It is advised that any new tests added to
.Nm
should also perform the same check with transaction group numbers, if
applicable.
.Pp
The main
.Nm
process uses an
.Xr mmap 2
temporary file to pass information to child processes which allows shared
memory to survive
.Xr exec 3
syscall.
A copy of the
.Vt ztest_shared_hdr_t
struct containing information on the size and number of shared
structures in the file is always stored at offset 0 of the file.
.Pp
For backwards compatibility testing
.Nm
can invoke an alternative version of
.Nm
after a
.Dv SIGKILL
signal using the
.Fl B
flag.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width 5n

.Sh CAVEATS
To allow for backward compatibility testing using older versions of
.Nm
the information stored in the
.Xr mmap 2
temporary file passed from parent process to child must
remain compatible with older versions of
.Nm .
