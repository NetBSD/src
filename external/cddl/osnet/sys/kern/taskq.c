/*
 * Kernel task queues: general-purpose asynchronous task scheduling.
 *
 * A common problem in kernel programming is the need to schedule tasks
 * to be performed later, by another thread. There are several reasons
 * you may want or need to do this:
 *
 * (1) The task isn't time-critical, but your current code path is.
 *
 * (2) The task may require grabbing locks that you already hold.
 *
 * (3) The task may need to block (e.g. to wait for memory), but you
 *     cannot block in your current context.
 *
 * (4) Your code path can't complete because of some condition, but you can't
 *     sleep or fail, so you queue the task for later execution when condition
 *     disappears.
 *
 * (5) You just want a simple way to launch multiple tasks in parallel.
 *
 * Task queues provide such a facility. In its simplest form (used when
 * performance is not a critical consideration) a task queue consists of a
 * single list of tasks, together with one or more threads to service the
 * list. There are some cases when this simple queue is not sufficient:
 *
 * (1) The task queues are very hot and there is a need to avoid data and lock
 *	contention over global resources.
 *
 * (2) Some tasks may depend on other tasks to complete, so they can't be put in
 *	the same list managed by the same thread.
 *
 * (3) Some tasks may block for a long time, and this should not block other
 * 	tasks in the queue.
 *
 * To provide useful service in such cases we define a "dynamic task queue"
 * which has an individual thread for each of the tasks. These threads are
 * dynamically created as they are needed and destroyed when they are not in
 * use. The API for managing task pools is the same as for managing task queues
 * with the exception of a taskq creation flag TASKQ_DYNAMIC which tells that
 * dynamic task pool behavior is desired.
 *
 * Dynamic task queues may also place tasks in the normal queue (called "backing
 * queue") when task pool runs out of resources. Users of task queues may
 * disallow such queued scheduling by specifying TQ_NOQUEUE in the dispatch
 * flags.
 *
 * The backing task queue is also used for scheduling internal tasks needed for
 * dynamic task queue maintenance.
 *
 * INTERFACES:
 *
 * taskq_t *taskq_create(name, nthreads, pri_t pri, minalloc, maxall, flags);
 *
 *	Create a taskq with specified properties.
 *	Possible 'flags':
 *
 *	  TASKQ_DYNAMIC: Create task pool for task management. If this flag is
 * 		specified, 'nthreads' specifies the maximum number of threads in
 *		the task queue. Task execution order for dynamic task queues is
 *		not predictable.
 *
 *		If this flag is not specified (default case) a
 * 		single-list task queue is created with 'nthreads' threads
 * 		servicing it. Entries in this queue are managed by
 * 		taskq_ent_alloc() and taskq_ent_free() which try to keep the
 * 		task population between 'minalloc' and 'maxalloc', but the
 *		latter limit is only advisory for TQ_SLEEP dispatches and the
 *		former limit is only advisory for TQ_NOALLOC dispatches. If
 *		TASKQ_PREPOPULATE is set in 'flags', the taskq will be
 *		prepopulated with 'minalloc' task structures.
 *
 *		Since non-DYNAMIC taskqs are queues, tasks are guaranteed to be
 *		executed in the order they are scheduled if nthreads == 1.
 *		If nthreads > 1, task execution order is not predictable.
 *
 *	  TASKQ_PREPOPULATE: Prepopulate task queue with threads.
 *		Also prepopulate the task queue with 'minalloc' task structures.
 *
 *	  TASKQ_CPR_SAFE: This flag specifies that users of the task queue will
 * 		use their own protocol for handling CPR issues. This flag is not
 *		supported for DYNAMIC task queues.
 *
 *	The 'pri' field specifies the default priority for the threads that
 *	service all scheduled tasks.
 *
 * void taskq_destroy(tap):
 *
 *	Waits for any scheduled tasks to complete, then destroys the taskq.
 *	Caller should guarantee that no new tasks are scheduled in the closing
 *	taskq.
 *
 * taskqid_t taskq_dispatch(tq, func, arg, flags):
 *
 *	Dispatches the task "func(arg)" to taskq. The 'flags' indicates whether
 *	the caller is willing to block for memory.  The function returns an
 *	opaque value which is zero iff dispatch fails.  If flags is TQ_NOSLEEP
 *	or TQ_NOALLOC and the task can't be dispatched, taskq_dispatch() fails
 *	and returns (taskqid_t)0.
 *
 *	ASSUMES: func != NULL.
 *
 *	Possible flags:
 *	  TQ_NOSLEEP: Do not wait for resources; may fail.
 *
 *	  TQ_NOALLOC: Do not allocate memory; may fail.  May only be used with
 *		non-dynamic task queues.
 *
 *	  TQ_NOQUEUE: Do not enqueue a task if it can't dispatch it due to
 *		lack of available resources and fail. If this flag is not
 * 		set, and the task pool is exhausted, the task may be scheduled
 *		in the backing queue. This flag may ONLY be used with dynamic
 *		task queues.
 *
 *		NOTE: This flag should always be used when a task queue is used
 *		for tasks that may depend on each other for completion.
 *		Enqueueing dependent tasks may create deadlocks.
 *
 *	  TQ_SLEEP:   May block waiting for resources. May still fail for
 * 		dynamic task queues if TQ_NOQUEUE is also specified, otherwise
 *		always succeed.
 *
 *	NOTE: Dynamic task queues are much more likely to fail in
 *		taskq_dispatch() (especially if TQ_NOQUEUE was specified), so it
 *		is important to have backup strategies handling such failures.
 *
 * void taskq_wait(tq):
 *
 *	Waits for all previously scheduled tasks to complete.
 *
 *	NOTE: It does not stop any new task dispatches.
 *	      Do NOT call taskq_wait() from a task: it will cause deadlock.
 *
 * void taskq_suspend(tq)
 *
 *	Suspend all task execution. Tasks already scheduled for a dynamic task
 *	queue will still be executed, but all new scheduled tasks will be
 *	suspended until taskq_resume() is called.
 *
 * int  taskq_suspended(tq)
 *
 *	Returns 1 if taskq is suspended and 0 otherwise. It is intended to
 *	ASSERT that the task queue is suspended.
 *
 * void taskq_resume(tq)
 *
 *	Resume task queue execution.
 *
 * int  taskq_member(tq, thread)
 *
 *	Returns 1 if 'thread' belongs to taskq 'tq' and 0 otherwise. The
 *	intended use is to ASSERT that a given function is called in taskq
 *	context only.
 *
 * system_taskq
 *
 *	Global system-wide dynamic task queue for common uses. It may be used by
 *	any subsystem that needs to schedule tasks and does not need to manage
 *	its own task queues. It is initialized quite early during system boot.
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION.
 *
 * This is schematic representation of the task queue structures.

 *
 * Task queues use tq_task field to link new entry in the queue. The queue is a
 * circular doubly-linked list. Entries are put in the end of the list with
 * TQ_APPEND() and processed from the front of the list by taskq_thread() in
 * FIFO order. Task queue entries are cached in the free list managed by
 * taskq_ent_alloc() and taskq_ent_free() functions.
 *
 *	All threads used by task queues mark t_taskq field of the thread to
 *	point to the task queue.
 *
 * Dynamic Task Queues Implementation.
 *
 * For a dynamic task queues there is a 1-to-1 mapping between a thread and
 * taskq_ent_structure. Each entry is serviced by its own thread and each thread
 * is controlled by a single entry.
 *
 * Entries are distributed over a set of buckets. To avoid using modulo
 * arithmetics the number of buckets is 2^n and is determined as the nearest
 * power of two roundown of the number of CPUs in the system. Tunable
 * variable 'taskq_maxbuckets' limits the maximum number of buckets. Each entry
 * is attached to a bucket for its lifetime and can't migrate to other buckets.
 *
 * Entries that have scheduled tasks are not placed in any list. The dispatch
 * function sets their "func" and "arg" fields and signals the corresponding
 * thread to execute the task. Once the thread executes the task it clears the
 * "func" field and places an entry on the bucket cache of free entries pointed
 * by "tqbucket_freelist" field. ALL entries on the free list should have "func"
 * field equal to NULL. The free list is a circular doubly-linked list identical
 * in structure to the tq_task list above, but entries are taken from it in LIFO
 * order - the last freed entry is the first to be allocated. The
 * taskq_bucket_dispatch() function gets the most recently used entry from the
 * free list, sets its "func" and "arg" fields and signals a worker thread.
 *
 * After executing each task a per-entry thread taskq_d_thread() places its
 * entry on the bucket free list and goes to a timed sleep. If it wakes up
 * without getting new task it removes the entry from the free list and destroys
 * itself. The thread sleep time is controlled by a tunable variable
 * `taskq_thread_timeout'.
 *
 * There is various statistics kept in the bucket which allows for later
 * analysis of taskq usage patterns. Also, a global copy of taskq creation and
 * death statistics is kept in the global taskq data structure. Since thread
 * creation and death happen rarely, updating such global data does not present
 * a performance problem.
 *
 * NOTE: Threads are not bound to any CPU and there is absolutely no association
 *       between the bucket and actual thread CPU, so buckets are used only to
 *	 split resources and reduce resource contention. Having threads attached
 *	 to the CPU denoted by a bucket may reduce number of times the job
 *	 switches between CPUs.
 *
 *	 Current algorithm creates a thread whenever a bucket has no free
 *	 entries. It would be nice to know how many threads are in the running
 *	 state and don't create threads if all CPUs are busy with existing
 *	 tasks, but it is unclear how such strategy can be implemented.
 *
 *	 Currently buckets are created statically as an array attached to task
 *	 queue. On some system with nCPUs < max_ncpus it may waste system
 *	 memory. One solution may be allocation of buckets when they are first
 *	 touched, but it is not clear how useful it is.
 *
 * SUSPEND/RESUME implementation.
 *
 *	Before executing a task taskq_thread() (executing non-dynamic task
 *	queues) obtains taskq's thread lock as a reader. The taskq_suspend()
 *	function gets the same lock as a writer blocking all non-dynamic task
 *	execution. The taskq_resume() function releases the lock allowing
 *	taskq_thread to continue execution.
 *
 *	For dynamic task queues, each bucket is marked as TQBUCKET_SUSPEND by
 *	taskq_suspend() function. After that taskq_bucket_dispatch() always
 *	fails, so that taskq_dispatch() will either enqueue tasks for a
 *	suspended backing queue or fail if TQ_NOQUEUE is specified in dispatch
 *	flags.
 *
 *	NOTE: taskq_suspend() does not immediately block any tasks already
 *	      scheduled for dynamic task queues. It only suspends new tasks
 *	      scheduled after taskq_suspend() was called.
 *
 *	taskq_member() function works by comparing a thread t_taskq pointer with
 *	the passed thread pointer.
 *
 * LOCKS and LOCK Hierarchy:
 *
 *   There are two locks used in task queues.
 *
 *   1) Task queue structure has a lock, protecting global task queue state.
 *
 *   2) Each per-CPU bucket has a lock for bucket management.
 *
 *   If both locks are needed, task queue lock should be taken only after bucket
 *   lock.
 *
 * DEBUG FACILITIES.
 *
 * For DEBUG kernels it is possible to induce random failures to
 * taskq_dispatch() function when it is given TQ_NOSLEEP argument. The value of
 * taskq_dmtbf and taskq_smtbf tunables control the mean time between induced
 * failures for dynamic and static task queues respectively.
 *
 * Setting TASKQ_STATISTIC to 0 will disable per-bucket statistics.
 *
 * TUNABLES
 *
 *	system_taskq_size	- Size of the global system_taskq.
 *				  This value is multiplied by nCPUs to determine
 *				  actual size.
 *				  Default value: 64
 *
 *	taskq_thread_timeout	- Maximum idle time for taskq_d_thread()
 *				  Default value: 5 minutes
 *
 *	taskq_maxbuckets	- Maximum number of buckets in any task queue
 *				  Default value: 128
 *
 *	taskq_search_depth	- Maximum # of buckets searched for a free entry
 *				  Default value: 4
 *
 *	taskq_dmtbf		- Mean time between induced dispatch failures
 *				  for dynamic task queues.
 *				  Default value: UINT_MAX (no induced failures)
 *
 *	taskq_smtbf		- Mean time between induced dispatch failures
 *				  for static task queues.
 *				  Default value: UINT_MAX (no induced failures)
 *
 * CONDITIONAL compilation.
 *
 *    TASKQ_STATISTIC	- If set will enable bucket statistic (default).
