/*
 *  The Cyclic Subsystem
 *  --------------------
 *
 *  Prehistory
 *
 *  Historically, most computer architectures have specified interval-based
 *  timer parts (e.g. SPARCstation's counter/timer; Intel's i8254).  While
 *  these parts deal in relative (i.e. not absolute) time values, they are
 *  typically used by the operating system to implement the abstraction of
 *  absolute time.  As a result, these parts cannot typically be reprogrammed
 *  without introducing error in the system's notion of time.
 *
 *  Starting in about 1994, chip architectures began specifying high resolution
 *  timestamp registers.  As of this writing (1999), all major chip families
 *  (UltraSPARC, PentiumPro, MIPS, PowerPC, Alpha) have high resolution
 *  timestamp registers, and two (UltraSPARC and MIPS) have added the capacity
 *  to interrupt based on timestamp values.  These timestamp-compare registers
 *  present a time-based interrupt source which can be reprogrammed arbitrarily
 *  often without introducing error.  Given the low cost of implementing such a
 *  timestamp-compare register (and the tangible benefit of eliminating
 *  discrete timer parts), it is reasonable to expect that future chip
 *  architectures will adopt this feature.
 *
 *  The cyclic subsystem has been designed to take advantage of chip
 *  architectures with the capacity to interrupt based on absolute, high
 *  resolution values of time.
 *
 *  Subsystem Overview
 *
 *  The cyclic subsystem is a low-level kernel subsystem designed to provide
 *  arbitrarily high resolution, per-CPU interval timers (to avoid colliding
 *  with existing terms, we dub such an interval timer a "cyclic").
 *  Alternatively, a cyclic may be specified to be "omnipresent", denoting
 *  firing on all online CPUs.
 *
 *  Cyclic Subsystem Interface Overview
 *  -----------------------------------
 *
 *  The cyclic subsystem has interfaces with the kernel at-large, with other
 *  kernel subsystems (e.g. the processor management subsystem, the checkpoint
 *  resume subsystem) and with the platform (the cyclic backend).  Each
 *  of these interfaces is given a brief synopsis here, and is described
 *  in full above the interface's implementation.
 *
 *  The following diagram displays the cyclic subsystem's interfaces to
 *  other kernel components.  The arrows denote a "calls" relationship, with
 *  the large arrow indicating the cyclic subsystem's consumer interface.
 *  Each arrow is labeled with the section in which the corresponding
 *  interface is described.

 *
 *  Cyclic Subsystem Implementation Overview
 *  ----------------------------------------
 *
 *  The cyclic subsystem is designed to minimize interference between cyclics
 *  on different CPUs.  Thus, all of the cyclic subsystem's data structures
 *  hang off of a per-CPU structure, cyc_cpu.
 *
 *  Each cyc_cpu has a power-of-two sized array of cyclic structures (the
 *  cyp_cyclics member of the cyc_cpu structure).  If cyclic_add() is called
 *  and there does not exist a free slot in the cyp_cyclics array, the size of
 *  the array will be doubled.  The array will never shrink.  Cyclics are
 *  referred to by their index in the cyp_cyclics array, which is of type
 *  cyc_index_t.
 *
 *  The cyclics are kept sorted by expiration time in the cyc_cpu's heap.  The
 *  heap is keyed by cyclic expiration time, with parents expiring earlier
 *  than their children.
 *
 *  Heap Management
 *
 *  The heap is managed primarily by cyclic_fire().  Upon entry, cyclic_fire()
 *  compares the root cyclic's expiration time to the current time.  If the
 *  expiration time is in the past, cyclic_expire() is called on the root
 *  cyclic.  Upon return from cyclic_expire(), the cyclic's new expiration time
 *  is derived by adding its interval to its old expiration time, and a
 *  downheap operation is performed.  After the downheap, cyclic_fire()
 *  examines the (potentially changed) root cyclic, repeating the
 *  cyclic_expire()/add interval/cyclic_downheap() sequence until the root
 *  cyclic has an expiration time in the future.  This expiration time
 *  (guaranteed to be the earliest in the heap) is then communicated to the
 *  backend via cyb_reprogram.  Optimal backends will next call cyclic_fire()
 *  shortly after the root cyclic's expiration time.
 *
 *  To allow efficient, deterministic downheap operations, we implement the
 *  heap as an array (the cyp_heap member of the cyc_cpu structure), with each
 *  element containing an index into the CPU's cyp_cyclics array.
 *
 *  The heap is laid out in the array according to the following:
 *
 *   1.  The root of the heap is always in the 0th element of the heap array
 *   2.  The left and right children of the nth element are element
 *       (((n + 1) << 1) - 1) and element ((n + 1) << 1), respectively.
 *
 *  This layout is standard (see, e.g., Cormen's "Algorithms"); the proof
 *  that these constraints correctly lay out a heap (or indeed, any binary
 *  tree) is trivial and left to the reader.
 *
 *  To see the heap by example, assume our cyclics array has the following
 *  members (at time t):
 *
 *            cy_handler                          cy_expire
 *            ---------------------------------------------
 *     [ 0]   clock()                            t+10000000
 *     [ 1]   deadman()                        t+1000000000
 *     [ 2]   clock_highres_fire()                    t+100
 *     [ 3]   clock_highres_fire()                   t+1000
 *     [ 4]   clock_highres_fire()                    t+500
 *     [ 5]   (free)                                     --
 *     [ 6]   (free)                                     --
 *     [ 7]   (free)                                     --
 *
 *  The heap array could be:
 *
 *                [0]   [1]   [2]   [3]   [4]   [5]   [6]   [7]
 *              +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
 *              |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
 *              |  2  |  3  |  4  |  0  |  1  |  x  |  x  |  x  |
 *              |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
 *              +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
 *
 *  Graphically, this array corresponds to the following (excuse the ASCII art):
 *
 *                                       2
 *                                       |
 *                    +------------------+------------------+
 *                    3                                     4
 *                    |
 *          +---------+--------+
 *          0                  1
 *
 *  Note that the heap is laid out by layer:  all nodes at a given depth are
 *  stored in consecutive elements of the array.  Moreover, layers of
 *  consecutive depths are in adjacent element ranges.  This property
 *  guarantees high locality of reference during downheap operations.
 *  Specifically, we are guaranteed that we can downheap to a depth of
 *
 *      lg (cache_line_size / sizeof (cyc_index_t))
 *
 *  nodes with at most one cache miss.  On UltraSPARC (64 byte e-cache line
 *  size), this corresponds to a depth of four nodes.  Thus, if there are
 *  fewer than sixteen cyclics in the heap, downheaps on UltraSPARC miss at
 *  most once in the e-cache.
 *
 *  Downheaps are required to compare siblings as they proceed down the
 *  heap.  For downheaps proceeding beyond the one-cache-miss depth, every
 *  access to a left child could potentially miss in the cache.  However,
 *  if we assume
 *
 *      (cache_line_size / sizeof (cyc_index_t)) > 2,
 *
 *  then all siblings are guaranteed to be on the same cache line.  Thus, the
 *  miss on the left child will guarantee a hit on the right child; downheaps
 *  will incur at most one cache miss per layer beyond the one-cache-miss
 *  depth.  The total number of cache misses for heap management during a
 *  downheap operation is thus bounded by
 *
 *      lg (n) - lg (cache_line_size / sizeof (cyc_index_t))
 *
 *  Traditional pointer-based heaps are implemented without regard to
 *  locality.  Downheaps can thus incur two cache misses per layer (one for
 *  each child), but at most one cache miss at the root.  This yields a bound
 *  of
 *
 *      2 * lg (n) - 1
 *
 *  on the total cache misses.
 *
 *  This difference may seem theoretically trivial (the difference is, after
 *  all, constant), but can become substantial in practice -- especially for
 *  caches with very large cache lines and high miss penalties (e.g. TLBs).
 *
 *  Heaps must always be full, balanced trees.  Heap management must therefore
 *  track the next point-of-insertion into the heap.  In pointer-based heaps,
 *  recomputing this point takes O(lg (n)).  Given the layout of the
 *  array-based implementation, however, the next point-of-insertion is
 *  always:
 *
 *      heap[number_of_elements]
 *
 *  We exploit this property by implementing the free-list in the usused
 *  heap elements.  Heap insertion, therefore, consists only of filling in
 *  the cyclic at cyp_cyclics[cyp_heap[number_of_elements]], incrementing
 *  the number of elements, and performing an upheap.  Heap deletion consists
 *  of decrementing the number of elements, swapping the to-be-deleted element
 *  with the element at cyp_heap[number_of_elements], and downheaping.
 *
 *  Filling in more details in our earlier example:
 *
 *                                               +--- free list head
 *                                               |
 *                                               V
 *
 *                [0]   [1]   [2]   [3]   [4]   [5]   [6]   [7]
 *              +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
 *              |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
 *              |  2  |  3  |  4  |  0  |  1  |  5  |  6  |  7  |
 *              |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
 *              +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
 *
 *  To insert into this heap, we would just need to fill in the cyclic at
 *  cyp_cyclics[5], bump the number of elements (from 5 to 6) and perform
 *  an upheap.
 *
 *  If we wanted to remove, say, cyp_cyclics[3], we would first scan for it
 *  in the cyp_heap, and discover it at cyp_heap[1].  We would then decrement
 *  the number of elements (from 5 to 4), swap cyp_heap[1] with cyp_heap[4],
 *  and perform a downheap from cyp_heap[1].  The linear scan is required
 *  because the cyclic does not keep a backpointer into the heap.  This makes
 *  heap manipulation (e.g. downheaps) faster at the expense of removal
 *  operations.
 *
 *  Expiry processing
 *
 *  As alluded to above, cyclic_expire() is called by cyclic_fire() to expire
 *  a cyclic.  Cyclic subsystem consumers are guaranteed that for an arbitrary
 *  time t in the future, their cyclic handler will have been called
 *  (t - cyt_when) / cyt_interval times. cyclic_expire() simply needs to call
 *  the handler.
 *
 *  Resizing
 *
 *  All of the discussion thus far has assumed a static number of cyclics.
 *  Obviously, static limitations are not practical; we need the capacity
 *  to resize our data structures dynamically.
 *
 *  We resize our data structures lazily, and only on a per-CPU basis.
 *  The size of the data structures always doubles and never shrinks.  We
 *  serialize adds (and thus resizes) on cpu_lock; we never need to deal
 *  with concurrent resizes.  Resizes should be rare; they may induce jitter
 *  on the CPU being resized, but should not affect cyclic operation on other
 *  CPUs.
 *
 *  Three key cyc_cpu data structures need to be resized:  the cyclics array,
 *  nad the heap array.  Resizing is relatively straightforward:
 *
 *    1.  The new, larger arrays are allocated in cyclic_expand() (called
 *        from cyclic_add()).
 *    2.  The contents of the old arrays are copied into the new arrays.
 *    3.  The old cyclics array is bzero()'d
 *    4.  The pointers are updated.
 *
 *  Removals
 *
 *  Cyclic removals should be rare.  To simplify the implementation (and to
 *  allow optimization for the cyclic_fire()/cyclic_expire()
 *  path), we force removals and adds to serialize on cpu_lock.

 *  cyclic_id_t cyclic_add(cyc_handler_t *, cyc_time_t *)
 *
 *  Overview
 *
 *    cyclic_add() will create an unbound cyclic with the specified handler and
 *    interval.  The cyclic will run on a CPU which both has interrupts enabled
 *    and is in the system CPU partition.
 *
 *  Arguments and notes
 *
 *    As its first argument, cyclic_add() takes a cyc_handler, which has the
 *    following members:
 *
 *      cyc_func_t cyh_func    <-- Cyclic handler
 *      void *cyh_arg          <-- Argument to cyclic handler
 *
 *    In addition to a cyc_handler, cyclic_add() takes a cyc_time, which
 *    has the following members:
 *
 *       hrtime_t cyt_when     <-- Absolute time, in nanoseconds since boot, at
 *                                 which to start firing
 *       hrtime_t cyt_interval <-- Length of interval, in nanoseconds
 *
 *    gethrtime() is the time source for nanoseconds since boot.  If cyt_when
 *    is set to 0, the cyclic will start to fire when cyt_interval next
 *    divides the number of nanoseconds since boot.
 *
 *    The cyt_interval field _must_ be filled in by the caller; one-shots are
 *    _not_ explicitly supported by the cyclic subsystem (cyclic_add() will
 *    assert that cyt_interval is non-zero).  The maximum value for either
 *    field is INT64_MAX; the caller is responsible for assuring that
 *    cyt_when + cyt_interval <= INT64_MAX.  Neither field may be negative.
 *
 *    For an arbitrary time t in the future, the cyclic handler is guaranteed
 *    to have been called (t - cyt_when) / cyt_interval times.  This will
 *    be true even if interrupts have been disabled for periods greater than
 *    cyt_interval nanoseconds.  In order to compensate for such periods,
 *    the cyclic handler may be called a finite number of times with an
 *    arbitrarily small interval.
 *
 *    The cyclic subsystem will not enforce any lower bound on the interval;
 *    if the interval is less than the time required to process an interrupt,
 *    the CPU will wedge.  It's the responsibility of the caller to assure that
 *    either the value of the interval is sane, or that its caller has
 *    sufficient privilege to deny service (i.e. its caller is root).
 *
 *  Return value
 *
 *    cyclic_add() returns a cyclic_id_t, which is guaranteed to be a value
 *    other than CYCLIC_NONE.  cyclic_add() cannot fail.
 *
 *  Caller's context
 *
 *    cpu_lock must be held by the caller, and the caller must not be in
 *    interrupt context.  cyclic_add() will perform a KM_SLEEP kernel
 *    memory allocation, so the usual rules (e.g. p_lock cannot be held)
 *    apply.  A cyclic may be added even in the presence of CPUs that have
 *    not been configured with respect to the cyclic subsystem, but only
 *    configured CPUs will be eligible to run the new cyclic.
 *
 *  Cyclic handler's context
 *
 *    Cyclic handlers will be executed in the interrupt context corresponding
 *    to the specified level (i.e. either high, lock or low level).  The
 *    usual context rules apply.
 *
 *    A cyclic handler may not grab ANY locks held by the caller of any of
 *    cyclic_add() or cyclic_remove(); the implementation of these functions
 *    may require blocking on cyclic handler completion.
 *    Moreover, cyclic handlers may not make any call back into the cyclic
 *    subsystem.

 *  cyclic_id_t cyclic_add_omni(cyc_omni_handler_t *)
 *
 *  Overview
 *
 *    cyclic_add_omni() will create an omnipresent cyclic with the specified
 *    online and offline handlers.  Omnipresent cyclics run on all online
 *    CPUs, including CPUs which have unbound interrupts disabled.
 *
 *  Arguments
 *
 *    As its only argument, cyclic_add_omni() takes a cyc_omni_handler, which
 *    has the following members:
 *
 *      void (*cyo_online)()   <-- Online handler
 *      void (*cyo_offline)()  <-- Offline handler
 *      void *cyo_arg          <-- Argument to be passed to on/offline handlers
 *
 *  Online handler
 *
 *    The cyo_online member is a pointer to a function which has the following
 *    four arguments:
 *
 *      void *                 <-- Argument (cyo_arg)
 *      cpu_t *                <-- Pointer to CPU about to be onlined
 *      cyc_handler_t *        <-- Pointer to cyc_handler_t; must be filled in
 *                                 by omni online handler
 *      cyc_time_t *           <-- Pointer to cyc_time_t; must be filled in by
 *                                 omni online handler
 *
 *    The omni cyclic online handler is always called _before_ the omni
 *    cyclic begins to fire on the specified CPU.  As the above argument
 *    description implies, the online handler must fill in the two structures
 *    passed to it:  the cyc_handler_t and the cyc_time_t.  These are the
 *    same two structures passed to cyclic_add(), outlined above.  This
 *    allows the omni cyclic to have maximum flexibility; different CPUs may
 *    optionally
 *
 *      (a)  have different intervals
 *      (b)  be explicitly in or out of phase with one another
 *      (c)  have different handlers
 *      (d)  have different handler arguments
 *      (e)  fire at different levels
 *
 *    Of these, (e) seems somewhat dubious, but is nonetheless allowed.
 *
 *    The omni online handler is called in the same context as cyclic_add(),
 *    and has the same liberties:  omni online handlers may perform KM_SLEEP
 *    kernel memory allocations, and may grab locks which are also acquired
 *    by cyclic handlers.  However, omni cyclic online handlers may _not_
 *    call back into the cyclic subsystem, and should be generally careful
 *    about calling into arbitrary kernel subsystems.
 *
 *  Offline handler
 *
 *    The cyo_offline member is a pointer to a function which has the following
 *    three arguments:
 *
 *      void *                 <-- Argument (cyo_arg)
 *      cpu_t *                <-- Pointer to CPU about to be offlined
 *      void *                 <-- CPU's cyclic argument (that is, value
 *                                 to which cyh_arg member of the cyc_handler_t
 *                                 was set in the omni online handler)
 *
 *    The omni cyclic offline handler is always called _after_ the omni
 *    cyclic has ceased firing on the specified CPU.  Its purpose is to
 *    allow cleanup of any resources dynamically allocated in the omni cyclic
 *    online handler.  The context of the offline handler is identical to
 *    that of the online handler; the same constraints and liberties apply.
 *
 *    The offline handler is optional; it may be NULL.
 *
 *  Return value
 *
 *    cyclic_add_omni() returns a cyclic_id_t, which is guaranteed to be a
 *    value other than CYCLIC_NONE.  cyclic_add_omni() cannot fail.
 *
 *  Caller's context
 *
 *    The caller's context is identical to that of cyclic_add(), specified
 *    above.

/*
 *  void cyclic_remove(cyclic_id_t)
 *
 *  Overview
 *
 *    cyclic_remove() will remove the specified cyclic from the system.
 *
 *  Arguments and notes
 *
 *    The only argument is a cyclic_id returned from either cyclic_add() or
 *    cyclic_add_omni().
 *
 *    By the time cyclic_remove() returns, the caller is guaranteed that the
 *    removed cyclic handler has completed execution (this is the same
 *    semantic that untimeout() provides).  As a result, cyclic_remove() may
 *    need to block, waiting for the removed cyclic to complete execution.
 *    This leads to an important constraint on the caller:  no lock may be
 *    held across cyclic_remove() that also may be acquired by a cyclic
 *    handler.
 *
 *  Return value
 *
 *    None; cyclic_remove() always succeeds.
 *
 *  Caller's context
 *
 *    cpu_lock must be held by the caller, and the caller must not be in
 *    interrupt context.  The caller may not hold any locks which are also
 *    grabbed by any cyclic handler.  See "Arguments and notes", above.
