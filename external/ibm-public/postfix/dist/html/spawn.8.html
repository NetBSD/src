SPAWN(8)                                                              SPAWN(8)

<b>NAME</b>
       spawn - Postfix external command spawner

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>spawn</b> [generic Postfix daemon options] command_attributes...

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  <a href="spawn.8.html"><b>spawn</b>(8)</a> daemon provides the Postfix equivalent of <b>inetd</b>.  It lis-
       tens on a port as specified in the Postfix <a href="master.5.html"><b>master.cf</b></a> file and spawns an
       external  command whenever a connection is established.  The connection
       can be made over local IPC (such as UNIX-domain sockets) or  over  non-
       local  IPC (such as TCP sockets).  The command's standard input, output
       and error streams are connected directly to the communication endpoint.

       This daemon expects to be run from the <a href="master.8.html"><b>master</b>(8)</a> process manager.

<b>COMMAND ATTRIBUTE SYNTAX</b>
       The  external command attributes are given in the <a href="master.5.html"><b>master.cf</b></a> file at the
       end of a service definition.  The syntax is as follows:

       <b>user</b>=<i>username</i> (required)

       <b>user</b>=<i>username</i>:<i>groupname</i>
              The external command is executed with the rights of  the  speci-
              fied  <i>username</i>.   The  software refuses to execute commands with
              root privileges, or with  the  privileges  of  the  mail  system
              owner.  If <i>groupname</i> is specified, the corresponding group ID is
              used instead of the group ID of <i>username</i>.

       <b>argv</b>=<i>command</i>... (required)
              The command to be executed. This must be specified as  the  last
              command attribute.  The command is executed directly, i.e. with-
              out interpretation of shell meta characters by a  shell  command
              interpreter.

<b>BUGS</b>
       In  order  to  enforce  standard Postfix process resource controls, the
       <a href="spawn.8.html"><b>spawn</b>(8)</a> daemon runs only one external command at a time.  As such,  it
       presents  a  noticeable overhead by wasting precious process resources.
       The <a href="spawn.8.html"><b>spawn</b>(8)</a> daemon is expected to be replaced  by  a  more  structural
       solution.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       The  <a href="spawn.8.html"><b>spawn</b>(8)</a> daemon reports abnormal child exits.  Problems are logged
       to <b>syslogd</b>(8).

<b>SECURITY</b>
       This program needs root privilege in order to execute external commands
       as the specified user. It is therefore security sensitive.  However the
       <a href="spawn.8.html"><b>spawn</b>(8)</a> daemon does not talk to the external command and thus  is  not
       vulnerable to data-driven attacks.

<b>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS</b>
       Changes  to  <a href="postconf.5.html"><b>main.cf</b></a>  are picked up automatically as <a href="spawn.8.html"><b>spawn</b>(8)</a> processes
       run for only a limited amount of time. Use the command "<b>postfix reload</b>"
       to speed up a change.

       The  text  below provides only a parameter summary. See <a href="postconf.5.html"><b>postconf</b>(5)</a> for
       more details including examples.

       In the text below, <i>transport</i> is the first field of  the  entry  in  the
       <a href="master.5.html"><b>master.cf</b></a> file.

<b>RESOURCE AND RATE CONTROL</b>
       <b><a href="postconf.5.html#transport_time_limit"><i>transport</i>_time_limit</a> ($<a href="postconf.5.html#command_time_limit">command_time_limit</a>)</b>
              The  amount  of  time the command is allowed to run before it is
              terminated.

              Postfix 2.4 and later support a suffix that specifies  the  time
              unit:  s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).
              The default time unit is seconds.
