POSTSUPER(1)                                                      POSTSUPER(1)

<b>NAME</b>
       postsuper - Postfix superintendent

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>postsuper</b> [<b>-psSv</b>] [<b>-c</b> <i>config</i><b>_</b><i>dir</i>] [<b>-d</b> <i>queue</i><b>_</b><i>id</i>]
               [<b>-h</b> <i>queue</i><b>_</b><i>id</i>] [<b>-H</b> <i>queue</i><b>_</b><i>id</i>]
               [<b>-r</b> <i>queue</i><b>_</b><i>id</i>] [<i>directory ...</i>]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  <a href="postsuper.1.html"><b>postsuper</b>(1)</a>  command  does maintenance jobs on the Postfix queue.
       Use  of  the  command  is  restricted  to  the  superuser.    See   the
       <a href="postqueue.1.html"><b>postqueue</b>(1)</a>  command for unprivileged queue operations such as listing
       or flushing the mail queue.

       By default, <a href="postsuper.1.html"><b>postsuper</b>(1)</a> performs the operations requested with the  <b>-s</b>
       and  <b>-p</b>  command-line  options  on all Postfix queue directories - this
       includes the <b>incoming</b>, <b>active</b> and <b>deferred</b> directories with mail  files
       and the <b>bounce</b>, <b>defer</b>, <b>trace</b> and <b>flush</b> directories with log files.

       Options:

       <b>-c</b> <i>config</i><b>_</b><i>dir</i>
              The <a href="postconf.5.html"><b>main.cf</b></a> configuration file is in the named directory instead
              of the default configuration directory. See also the MAIL_CONFIG
              environment setting below.

       <b>-d</b> <i>queue</i><b>_</b><i>id</i>
              Delete  one  message with the named queue ID from the named mail
              queue(s) (default: <b>hold</b>, <b>incoming</b>, <b>active</b> and <b>deferred</b>).

              If a <i>queue</i><b>_</b><i>id</i> of <b>-</b> is specified, the  program  reads  queue  IDs
              from  standard  input.  For  example,  to  delete  all mail with
              exactly one recipient <b>user@example.com</b>:

              mailq | tail +2 | grep -v '^ *(' | awk  'BEGIN { RS = "" }
                  # $7=sender, $8=recipient1, $9=recipient2
                  { if ($8 == "user@example.com" &amp;&amp; $9 == "")
                        print $1 }
              ' | tr -d '*!' | postsuper -d -

              Specify "<b>-d ALL</b>" to remove all messages;  for  example,  specify
              "<b>-d  ALL deferred</b>" to delete all mail in the <b>deferred</b> queue.  As
              a safety measure, the word <b>ALL</b> must be specified in upper  case.

              Warning:  Postfix  queue  IDs are reused (always with Postfix &lt;=
              2.8; and with Postfix  &gt;=  2.9  when  <a href="postconf.5.html#enable_long_queue_ids">enable_long_queue_ids</a>=no).
              There  is  a  very  small possibility that postsuper deletes the
              wrong message file when it is executed while  the  Postfix  mail
              system is delivering mail.

              The scenario is as follows:

              1)     The  Postfix queue manager deletes the message that <a href="postsuper.1.html"><b>post-</b></a>
                     <a href="postsuper.1.html"><b>super</b>(1)</a> is asked to delete, because Postfix is  finished
                     with  the  message (it is delivered, or it is returned to
                     the sender).

              2)     New mail arrives, and the new message is given  the  same
                     queue  ID as the message that <a href="postsuper.1.html"><b>postsuper</b>(1)</a> is supposed to
                     delete.  The probability for reusing a deleted  queue  ID
                     is  about 1 in 2**15 (the number of different microsecond
                     values that the system clock  can  distinguish  within  a
                     second).

              3)     <a href="postsuper.1.html"><b>postsuper</b>(1)</a>  deletes the new message, instead of the old
                     message that it should have deleted.

       <b>-h</b> <i>queue</i><b>_</b><i>id</i>
              Put mail "on hold" so that no attempt is  made  to  deliver  it.
              Move  one  message  with  the named queue ID from the named mail
              queue(s) (default: <b>incoming</b>, <b>active</b> and <b>deferred</b>)  to  the  <b>hold</b>
              queue.

              If  a  <i>queue</i><b>_</b><i>id</i>  of  <b>-</b> is specified, the program reads queue IDs
              from standard input.

              Specify "<b>-h ALL</b>" to hold all messages; for example, specify  "<b>-h</b>
              <b>ALL  deferred</b>"  to  hold  all  mail in the <b>deferred</b> queue.  As a
              safety measure, the word <b>ALL</b> must be specified in upper case.

              Note: while mail is "on hold" it will not expire when  its  time
              in    the    queue   exceeds   the   <b><a href="postconf.5.html#maximal_queue_lifetime">maximal_queue_lifetime</a></b>   or
              <b><a href="postconf.5.html#bounce_queue_lifetime">bounce_queue_lifetime</a></b> setting. It becomes subject to  expiration
              after it is released from "hold".

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

       <b>-H</b> <i>queue</i><b>_</b><i>id</i>
              Release  mail that was put "on hold".  Move one message with the
              named queue ID from the named mail queue(s) (default:  <b>hold</b>)  to
              the <b>deferred</b> queue.

              If  a  <i>queue</i><b>_</b><i>id</i>  of  <b>-</b> is specified, the program reads queue IDs
              from standard input.

              Note: specify "<b>postsuper -r</b>" to release mail that  was  kept  on
              hold  for  a  significant fraction of <b>$<a href="postconf.5.html#maximal_queue_lifetime">maximal_queue_lifetime</a></b> or
              <b>$<a href="postconf.5.html#bounce_queue_lifetime">bounce_queue_lifetime</a></b>, or longer.

              Specify "<b>-H ALL</b>" to release all mail that is "on  hold".   As  a
              safety measure, the word <b>ALL</b> must be specified in upper case.

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

       <b>-p</b>     Purge  old  temporary  files  that are left over after system or
              software crashes.

       <b>-r</b> <i>queue</i><b>_</b><i>id</i>
              Requeue the message with the named queue ID from the named  mail
              queue(s)  (default:  <b>hold</b>,  <b>incoming</b>,  <b>active</b> and <b>deferred</b>).  To
              requeue multiple  messages,  specify  multiple  <b>-r</b>  command-line
              options.

              Alternatively,  if  a  <i>queue</i><b>_</b><i>id</i>  of  <b>-</b> is specified, the program
              reads queue IDs from standard input.

              Specify "<b>-r ALL</b>" to requeue all messages. As a  safety  measure,
              the word <b>ALL</b> must be specified in upper case.

              A requeued message is moved to the <b>maildrop</b> queue, from where it
              is copied by the <a href="pickup.8.html"><b>pickup</b>(8)</a> and <a href="cleanup.8.html"><b>cleanup</b>(8)</a> daemons to a new queue
              file.  In  many respects its handling differs from that of a new
              local submission.

              <b>o</b>      The message is not  subjected  to  the  <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_milters">smtpd_milters</a>  or
                     <a href="postconf.5.html#non_smtpd_milters">non_smtpd_milters</a> settings.  When mail has passed through
                     an external content filter, this would produce  incorrect
                     results  with Milter applications that depend on original
                     SMTP connection state information.

              <b>o</b>      The message is subjected again to mail address  rewriting
                     and substitution.  This is useful when rewriting rules or
                     virtual mappings have changed.

                     The address rewriting context (local or  remote)  is  the
                     same as when the message was received.

              <b>o</b>      The  message is subjected to the same <a href="postconf.5.html#content_filter">content_filter</a> set-
                     tings (if any) as used for new  local  mail  submissions.
                     This is useful when <a href="postconf.5.html#content_filter">content_filter</a> settings have changed.

              Warning: Postfix queue IDs are reused (always  with  Postfix  &lt;=
              2.8;  and  with  Postfix  &gt;= 2.9 when <a href="postconf.5.html#enable_long_queue_ids">enable_long_queue_ids</a>=no).
              There is a very small possibility that <a href="postsuper.1.html"><b>postsuper</b>(1)</a> requeues the
              wrong  message  file  when it is executed while the Postfix mail
              system is running, but no harm should be done.

              This feature is available in Postfix 1.1 and later.

       <b>-s</b>     Structure check and structure repair.  This should be done  once
              before Postfix startup.

              <b>o</b>      Rename  files  whose name does not match the message file
                     inode number. This operation is necessary after restoring
                     a  mail  queue  from  a different machine or from backup,
                     when queue files were created with Postfix &lt;= 2.8 or with
                     "<a href="postconf.5.html#enable_long_queue_ids">enable_long_queue_ids</a> = no".

              <b>o</b>      Move  queue files that are in the wrong place in the file
                     system hierarchy and remove subdirectories  that  are  no
                     longer  needed.   File position rearrangements are neces-
                     sary  after  a  change  in  the  <b><a href="postconf.5.html#hash_queue_names">hash_queue_names</a></b>  and/or
                     <b><a href="postconf.5.html#hash_queue_depth">hash_queue_depth</a></b> configuration parameters.

              <b>o</b>      Rename  queue files created with "<a href="postconf.5.html#enable_long_queue_ids">enable_long_queue_ids</a> =
                     yes" to short names, for migration  to  Postfix  &lt;=  2.8.
                     The procedure is as follows:

                     # postfix stop
                     # postconf <a href="postconf.5.html#enable_long_queue_ids">enable_long_queue_ids</a>=no
                     # postsuper

                     Run <a href="postsuper.1.html"><b>postsuper</b>(1)</a> repeatedly until it stops reporting file
                     name changes.

       <b>-S</b>     A redundant version of <b>-s</b> that requires  that  long  file  names
              also match the message file inode number. This option exists for
              testing purposes, and is available with Postfix 2.9 and later.

       <b>-v</b>     Enable verbose  logging  for  debugging  purposes.  Multiple  <b>-v</b>
              options make the software increasingly verbose.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Problems are reported to the standard error stream and to <b>syslogd</b>(8).

       <a href="postsuper.1.html"><b>postsuper</b>(1)</a> reports the number of messages deleted with <b>-d</b>, the number
       of messages requeued with <b>-r</b>, and the number of  messages  whose  queue
       file  name  was  fixed  with  <b>-s</b>. The report is written to the standard
       error stream and to <b>syslogd</b>(8).

<b>ENVIRONMENT</b>
       MAIL_CONFIG
              Directory with the <a href="postconf.5.html"><b>main.cf</b></a> file.

<b>BUGS</b>
       Mail that is not sanitized by Postfix (i.e. mail in the <b>maildrop</b> queue)
       cannot be placed "on hold".
