PGSQL_TABLE(5)                                                  PGSQL_TABLE(5)

<b>NAME</b>
       pgsql_table - Postfix PostgreSQL client configuration

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>postmap -q "</b><i>string</i><b>" <a href="pgsql_table.5.html">pgsql</a>:/etc/postfix/</b><i>filename</i>

       <b>postmap -q - <a href="pgsql_table.5.html">pgsql</a>:/etc/postfix/</b><i>filename</i> &lt;<i>inputfile</i>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  Postfix  mail system uses optional tables for address rewriting or
       mail routing. These tables are usually in <b>dbm</b> or <b>db</b> format.

       Alternatively, lookup tables can be specified as PostgreSQL  databases.
       In  order  to  use  PostgreSQL lookups, define a PostgreSQL source as a
       lookup table in <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>, for example:
           <a href="postconf.5.html#alias_maps">alias_maps</a> = <a href="pgsql_table.5.html">pgsql</a>:/etc/pgsql-aliases.cf

       The file /etc/postfix/pgsql-aliases.cf has the same format as the Post-
       fix <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a> file, and can specify the parameters described below.

<b>BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY</b>
       For  compatibility with other Postfix lookup tables, PostgreSQL parame-
       ters can also be defined in <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>.  In order to do that,  specify  as
       PostgreSQL source a name that doesn't begin with a slash or a dot.  The
       PostgreSQL parameters will then be accessible as the name you've  given
       the source in its definition, an underscore, and the name of the param-
       eter.  For example, if the map is specified as  "<a href="pgsql_table.5.html">pgsql</a>:<i>pgsqlname</i>",  the
       parameter  "hosts"  below  would  be  defined  in  <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>  as  "<i>pgsql-</i>
       <i>name</i>_hosts".

       Note: with this form, the passwords  for  the  PostgreSQL  sources  are
       written in <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>, which is normally world-readable.  Support for this
       form will be removed in a future Postfix version.

       Normally, the SQL query is  specified  via  a  single  <b>query</b>  parameter
       (described in more detail below).  When this parameter is not specified
       in the map definition, Postfix reverts to an older interface, with  the
       SQL   query constructed  from the <b>select_function</b>, <b>select_field</b>, <b>table</b>,
       <b>where_field</b> and <b>additional_conditions</b> parameters.   The  old  interface
       will be gradually phased out. To migrate to the new interface set:

           <b>query</b> = SELECT <i>select</i><b>_</b><i>function</i>('%s')

       or in the absence of <b>select_function</b>, the lower precedence:

           <b>query</b> = SELECT <i>select</i><b>_</b><i>field</i>
               FROM <i>table</i>
               WHERE <i>where</i><b>_</b><i>field</i> = '%s'
                   <i>additional</i><b>_</b><i>conditions</i>

       Use  the  value,  not the name, of each legacy parameter. Note that the
       <b>additional_conditions</b> parameter is optional  and  if  not  empty,  will
       always start with <b>AND</b>.

<b>LIST MEMBERSHIP</b>
       When  using  SQL  to  store  lists such as $<a href="postconf.5.html#mynetworks">mynetworks</a>, $<a href="postconf.5.html#mydestination">mydestination</a>,
       $<a href="postconf.5.html#relay_domains">relay_domains</a>, $<a href="postconf.5.html#local_recipient_maps">local_recipient_maps</a>, etc., it is important to  under-
       stand that the table must store each list member as a separate key. The
       table lookup verifies the *existence* of the key.  See  "Postfix  lists
       versus tables" in the <a href="DATABASE_README.html">DATABASE_README</a> document for a discussion.

       Do  NOT create tables that return the full list of domains in $<a href="postconf.5.html#mydestination">mydesti</a>-
       <a href="postconf.5.html#mydestination">nation</a> or $<a href="postconf.5.html#relay_domains">relay_domains</a> etc., or IP addresses in $<a href="postconf.5.html#mynetworks">mynetworks</a>.

       DO create tables with each matching item as a key and with an arbitrary
       value.  With  SQL databases it is not uncommon to return the key itself
       or a constant value.

<b>PGSQL PARAMETERS</b>
       <b>hosts</b>  The hosts that Postfix will try to connect to  and  query  from.
              Specify <i>unix:</i> for UNIX-domain sockets, <i>inet:</i> for TCP connections
              (default).  Example:
                  hosts = host1.some.domain host2.some.domain:port
                  hosts = unix:/file/name

              The hosts are tried in random order, with all  connections  over
              UNIX domain sockets being tried before those over TCP.  The con-
              nections are automatically closed after being idle for  about  1
              minute, and are re-opened as necessary.

              NOTE:  the  <i>unix:</i>  and <i>inet:</i> prefixes are accepted for backwards
              compatibility reasons, but are actually ignored.  The PostgreSQL
              client  library  will always try to connect to an UNIX socket if
              the name starts with a slash, and will try a TCP connection oth-
              erwise.

       <b>user, password</b>
              The  user name and password to log into the pgsql server.  Exam-
              ple:
                  user = someone
                  password = some_password

       <b>dbname</b> The database name on the servers. Example:
                  dbname = customer_database

       <b>query</b>  The SQL query template used to search the database, where <b>%s</b>  is
              a  substitute for the address Postfix is trying to resolve, e.g.
                  query = SELECT replacement FROM aliases WHERE mailbox = '%s'

              This parameter supports the following '%' expansions:

              <b>%%</b>     This is replaced by a literal '%' character. (Postfix 2.2
                     and later)

              <b>%s</b>     This  is  replaced by the input key.  SQL quoting is used
                     to make sure that the input key does not  add  unexpected
                     metacharacters.

              <b>%u</b>     When the input key is an address of the form user@domain,
                     <b>%u</b> is replaced by  the  SQL  quoted  local  part  of  the
                     address.   Otherwise, <b>%u</b> is replaced by the entire search
                     string.  If the localpart is empty,  the  query  is  sup-
                     pressed and returns no results.

              <b>%d</b>     When the input key is an address of the form user@domain,
                     <b>%d</b> is replaced by the  SQL  quoted  domain  part  of  the
                     address.   Otherwise, the query is suppressed and returns
                     no results.

              <b>%[SUD]</b> The upper-case equivalents of the above expansions behave
                     in  the  <b>query</b>  parameter identically to their lower-case
                     counter-parts.  With  the  <b>result_format</b>  parameter  (see
                     below),  they expand the input key rather than the result
                     value.

                     The above %S, %U and %D  expansions  are  available  with
                     Postfix 2.2 and later

              <b>%[1-9]</b> The  patterns  %1,  %2, ... %9 are replaced by the corre-
                     sponding most significant component of  the  input  key's
                     domain.  If  the input key is <i>user@mail.example.com</i>, then
                     %1 is <b>com</b>, %2 is <b>example</b> and %3 is <b>mail</b>. If the input key
                     is  unqualified or does not have enough domain components
                     to satisfy all the specified patterns, the query is  sup-
                     pressed and returns no results.

                     The  above %1, ... %9 expansions are available with Post-
                     fix 2.2 and later

              The <b>domain</b> parameter described below limits the  input  keys  to
              addresses  in  matching  domains.  When  the <b>domain</b> parameter is
              non-empty, SQL queries for unqualified addresses or addresses in
              non-matching domains are suppressed and return no results.

              The  precedence  of this parameter has changed with Postfix 2.2,
              in prior releases the precedence was, from  highest  to  lowest,
              <b>select_function</b>, <b>query</b>, <b>select_field</b>, ...

              With Postfix 2.2 the <b>query</b> parameter has highest precedence, see
              COMPATIBILITY above.

              NOTE: DO NOT put quotes around the <b>query</b> parameter.

       <b>result_format (default: %s</b>)
              Format template applied to result attributes. Most commonly used
              to  append  (or prepend) text to the result. This parameter sup-
              ports the following '%' expansions:

              <b>%%</b>     This is replaced by a literal '%' character.

              <b>%s</b>     This is replaced by the value of  the  result  attribute.
                     When result is empty it is skipped.

              <b>%u</b>     When the result attribute value is an address of the form
                     user@domain, <b>%u</b> is replaced by  the  local  part  of  the
                     address.  When  the  result  has an empty localpart it is
                     skipped.

              <b>%d</b>     When a result attribute value is an address of  the  form
                     user@domain,  <b>%d</b>  is  replaced  by the domain part of the
                     attribute value. When the result  is  unqualified  it  is
                     skipped.

              <b>%[SUD1-9]</b>
                     The  upper-case  and decimal digit expansions interpolate
                     the parts of the input key rather than the result.  Their
                     behavior  is  identical to that described with <b>query</b>, and
                     in fact because  the  input  key  is  known  in  advance,
                     queries  whose  key  does not contain all the information
                     specified in  the  result  template  are  suppressed  and
                     return no results.

              For example, using "result_format = <a href="smtp.8.html">smtp</a>:[%s]" allows one to use
              a mailHost attribute as the basis of a <a href="transport.5.html">transport(5)</a> table. After
              applying  the result format, multiple values are concatenated as
              comma  separated  strings.  The  expansion_limit  and  parameter
              explained  below  allows one to restrict the number of values in
              the result, which is especially useful for maps that must return
              at most one value.

              The  default value <b>%s</b> specifies that each result value should be
              used as is.

              This parameter is available with Postfix 2.2 and later.

              NOTE: DO NOT put quotes around the result format!

       <b>domain (default: no domain list)</b>
              This is a list of domain names, paths to files, or dictionaries.
              When   specified,  only  fully  qualified  search  keys  with  a
              *non-empty* localpart and a matching  domain  are  eligible  for
              lookup:  'user'  lookups,  bare  domain  lookups  and  "@domain"
              lookups are not performed. This  can  significantly  reduce  the
              query load on the PostgreSQL server.
                  domain = postfix.org, <a href="DATABASE_README.html#types">hash</a>:/etc/postfix/searchdomains

              It  is best not to use SQL to store the domains eligible for SQL
              lookups.

              This parameter is available with Postfix 2.2 and later.

              NOTE: DO NOT define this parameter for <a href="local.8.html">local(8)</a> aliases, because
              the input keys are always unqualified.

       <b>expansion_limit (default: 0)</b>
              A  limit  on  the total number of result elements returned (as a
              comma separated list) by a lookup against the map.  A setting of
              zero  disables the limit. Lookups fail with a temporary error if
              the limit is exceeded.  Setting the  limit  to  1  ensures  that
              lookups do not return multiple values.

<b>OBSOLETE QUERY INTERFACES</b>
       This section describes query interfaces that are deprecated as of Post-
       fix 2.2.  Please migrate to the new <b>query</b> interface as the  old  inter-
       faces are slated to be phased out.

       <b>select_function</b>
              This parameter specifies a database function name. Example:
                  select_function = my_lookup_user_alias

              This is equivalent to:
                  query = SELECT my_lookup_user_alias('%s')

              This   parameter   overrides  the  legacy  table-related  fields
              (described below). With Postfix versions prior to 2.2,  it  also
              overrides  the  <b>query</b>  parameter. Starting with Postfix 2.2, the
              <b>query</b> parameter has highest precedence, and the  <b>select_function</b>
              parameter is deprecated.

       The  following  parameters (with lower precedence than the <b>select_func-</b>
       <b>tion</b> interface described above) can be used to  build  the  SQL  select
       statement as follows:

           SELECT [<b>select_field</b>]
           FROM [<b>table</b>]
           WHERE [<b>where_field</b>] = '%s'
                 [<b>additional_conditions</b>]

       The  specifier %s is replaced with each lookup by the lookup key and is
       escaped so if it contains single quotes or  other  odd  characters,  it
       will not cause a parse error, or worse, a security problem.

       Starting with Postfix 2.2, this interface is obsoleted by the more gen-
       eral <b>query</b> interface described above. If higher precedence the <b>query</b> or
       <b>select_function</b>  parameters described above are defined, the parameters
       described here are ignored.

       <b>select_field</b>
              The SQL "select" parameter. Example:
                  <b>select_field</b> = forw_addr

       <b>table</b>  The SQL "select .. from" table name. Example:
                  <b>table</b> = mxaliases

       <b>where_field</b>
              The SQL "select .. where" parameter. Example:
                  <b>where_field</b> = alias

       <b>additional_conditions</b>
              Additional conditions to the SQL query. Example:
                  <b>additional_conditions</b> = AND status = 'paid'
