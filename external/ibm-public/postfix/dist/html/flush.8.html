FLUSH(8)                                                              FLUSH(8)

<b>NAME</b>
       flush - Postfix fast flush server

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>flush</b> [generic Postfix daemon options]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The <a href="flush.8.html"><b>flush</b>(8)</a> server maintains a record of deferred mail by destination.
       This information is used to improve the performance of  the  SMTP  <b>ETRN</b>
       request,   and  of  its  command-line  equivalent,  "<b>sendmail  -qR</b>"  or
       "<b>postqueue -f</b>".  This program expects to  be  run  from  the  <a href="master.8.html"><b>master</b>(8)</a>
       process manager.

       The record is implemented as a per-destination logfile with as contents
       the queue IDs of deferred mail. A logfile is append-only, and is  trun-
       cated  when  delivery is requested for the corresponding destination. A
       destination is the part on the right-hand side of the right-most  <b>@</b>  in
       an email address.

       Per-destination  logfiles of deferred mail are maintained only for eli-
       gible destinations. The list of eligible destinations is specified with
       the  <b><a href="postconf.5.html#fast_flush_domains">fast_flush_domains</a></b>  configuration  parameter,  which  defaults  to
       <b>$<a href="postconf.5.html#relay_domains">relay_domains</a></b>.

       This server implements the following requests:

       <b>add</b> <i>sitename queueid</i>
              Inform the <a href="flush.8.html"><b>flush</b>(8)</a> server that the message with  the  specified
              queue ID is queued for the specified destination.

       <b>send_site</b> <i>sitename</i>
              Request delivery of mail that is queued for the specified desti-
              nation.

       <b>send_file</b> <i>queueid</i>
              Request delivery of the specified deferred message.

       <b>refresh</b>
              Refresh non-empty per-destination logfiles that were not read in
              <b>$<a href="postconf.5.html#fast_flush_refresh_time">fast_flush_refresh_time</a></b> hours, by simulating send requests (see
              above) for the corresponding destinations.

              Delete empty per-destination logfiles that were not  updated  in
              <b>$<a href="postconf.5.html#fast_flush_purge_time">fast_flush_purge_time</a></b> days.

              This request completes in the background.

       <b>purge</b>  Do a <b>refresh</b> for all per-destination logfiles.

<b>SECURITY</b>
       The  <a href="flush.8.html"><b>flush</b>(8)</a> server is not security-sensitive. It does not talk to the
       network, and it does not talk to local users.  The  fast  flush  server
       can run chrooted at fixed low privilege.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Problems and transactions are logged to <b>syslogd</b>(8).

<b>BUGS</b>
       Fast flush logfiles are truncated only after a "send" request, not when
       mail is actually delivered, and therefore can  accumulate  outdated  or
       redundant data. In order to maintain sanity, "refresh" must be executed
       periodically. This can be automated with a suitable wakeup  timer  set-
       ting in the <a href="master.5.html"><b>master.cf</b></a> configuration file.

       Upon  receipt of a request to deliver mail for an eligible destination,
       the <a href="flush.8.html"><b>flush</b>(8)</a> server requests delivery of all messages that  are  listed
       in  that  destination's  logfile, regardless of the recipients of those
       messages. This is not an issue for mail that is sent to a <b><a href="postconf.5.html#relay_domains">relay_domains</a></b>
       destination  because  such  mail  typically  only has recipients in one
       domain.

<b>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS</b>
       Changes to <a href="postconf.5.html"><b>main.cf</b></a> are picked up automatically  as  <a href="flush.8.html"><b>flush</b>(8)</a>  processes
       run for only a limited amount of time. Use the command "<b>postfix reload</b>"
       to speed up a change.
