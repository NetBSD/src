RELOCATED(5)                                                      RELOCATED(5)

<b>NAME</b>
       relocated - Postfix relocated table format

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>postmap /etc/postfix/relocated</b>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  optional  <a href="relocated.5.html"><b>relocated</b>(5)</a> table provides the information that is used
       in "user has moved to <i>new</i><b>_</b><i>location</i>" bounce messages.

       Normally, the <a href="relocated.5.html"><b>relocated</b>(5)</a> table is  specified  as  a  text  file  that
       serves as input to the <a href="postmap.1.html"><b>postmap</b>(1)</a> command.  The result, an indexed file
       in <b>dbm</b> or <b>db</b> format, is used for fast searching  by  the  mail  system.
       Execute  the  command  "<b>postmap  /etc/postfix/relocated</b>"  to rebuild an
       indexed file after changing the corresponding relocated table.

       When the table is provided via other means such as NIS,  LDAP  or  SQL,
       the same lookups are done as for ordinary indexed files.

       Alternatively,  the  table  can be provided as a regular-expression map
       where patterns are given as regular  expressions,  or  lookups  can  be
       directed  to TCP-based server. In those case, the lookups are done in a
       slightly different way as described  below  under  "REGULAR  EXPRESSION
       TABLES" or "TCP-BASED TABLES".

       Table lookups are case insensitive.

<b>CASE FOLDING</b>
       The  search string is folded to lowercase before database lookup. As of
       Postfix 2.3, the search string is not case folded with  database  types
       such  as  <a href="regexp_table.5.html">regexp</a>: or <a href="pcre_table.5.html">pcre</a>: whose lookup fields can match both upper and
       lower case.

<b>TABLE FORMAT</b>
       The input format for the <a href="postmap.1.html"><b>postmap</b>(1)</a> command is as follows:

       <b>o</b>      An entry has one of the following form:

                   <i>pattern      new</i><b>_</b><i>location</i>

              Where <i>new</i><b>_</b><i>location</i> specifies  contact  information  such  as  an
              email  address, or perhaps a street address or telephone number.

       <b>o</b>      Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored, as are  lines
              whose first non-whitespace character is a `#'.

       <b>o</b>      A  logical  line  starts  with  non-whitespace text. A line that
              starts with whitespace continues a logical line.

<b>TABLE SEARCH ORDER</b>
       With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM,  or  from  networked
       tables  such  as  NIS,  LDAP or SQL, patterns are tried in the order as
       listed below:

       <i>user</i>@<i>domain</i>
              Matches <i>user</i>@<i>domain</i>. This form has  precedence  over  all  other
              forms.

       <i>user</i>   Matches <i>user</i>@<i>site</i> when <i>site</i> is $<b><a href="postconf.5.html#myorigin">myorigin</a></b>, when <i>site</i> is listed in
              $<b><a href="postconf.5.html#mydestination">mydestination</a></b>, or when <i>site</i> is listed  in  $<b><a href="postconf.5.html#inet_interfaces">inet_interfaces</a></b>  or
              $<b><a href="postconf.5.html#proxy_interfaces">proxy_interfaces</a></b>.

       @<i>domain</i>
              Matches  other  addresses  in  <i>domain</i>.  This form has the lowest
              precedence.

<b>ADDRESS EXTENSION</b>
       When a mail address localpart contains the optional recipient delimiter
       (e.g.,  <i>user+foo</i>@<i>domain</i>),  the  lookup  order becomes: <i>user+foo</i>@<i>domain</i>,
       <i>user</i>@<i>domain</i>, <i>user+foo</i>, <i>user</i>, and @<i>domain</i>.

<b>REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES</b>
       This section describes how the table lookups change when the  table  is
       given  in  the form of regular expressions or when lookups are directed
       to a TCP-based server. For a description of regular  expression  lookup
       table  syntax,  see <a href="regexp_table.5.html"><b>regexp_table</b>(5)</a> or <a href="pcre_table.5.html"><b>pcre_table</b>(5)</a>. For a description
       of the TCP client/server table lookup protocol, see <a href="tcp_table.5.html"><b>tcp_table</b>(5)</a>.  This
       feature is not available up to and including Postfix version 2.4.

       Each  pattern  is  a  regular  expression that is applied to the entire
       address being looked up. Thus, <i>user@domain</i> mail addresses are not  bro-
       ken  up  into their <i>user</i> and <i>@domain</i> constituent parts, nor is <i>user+foo</i>
       broken up into <i>user</i> and <i>foo</i>.

       Patterns are applied in the order as specified in the  table,  until  a
       pattern is found that matches the search string.

       Results  are the same as with indexed file lookups, with the additional
       feature that parenthesized substrings from the pattern can be  interpo-
       lated as <b>$1</b>, <b>$2</b> and so on.

<b>TCP-BASED TABLES</b>
       This  section  describes  how the table lookups change when lookups are
       directed  to  a  TCP-based  server.  For  a  description  of  the   TCP
       client/server  lookup  protocol, see <a href="tcp_table.5.html"><b>tcp_table</b>(5)</a>.  This feature is not
       available up to and including Postfix version 2.4.

       Each lookup operation uses the entire address once.  Thus,  <i>user@domain</i>
       mail  addresses  are  not  broken  up  into their <i>user</i> and <i>@domain</i> con-
       stituent parts, nor is <i>user+foo</i> broken up into <i>user</i> and <i>foo</i>.

       Results are the same as with indexed file lookups.

<b>BUGS</b>
       The table format does not understand quoting conventions.

<b>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS</b>
       The following <a href="postconf.5.html"><b>main.cf</b></a> parameters are  especially  relevant.   The  text
       below  provides  only  a  parameter  summary.  See <a href="postconf.5.html"><b>postconf</b>(5)</a> for more
       details including examples.

              The network interface addresses that this system  receives  mail
              on.   You  need  to  stop  and start Postfix when this parameter
