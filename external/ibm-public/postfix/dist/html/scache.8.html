SCACHE(8)                                                            SCACHE(8)

<b>NAME</b>
       scache - Postfix shared connection cache server

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>scache</b> [generic Postfix daemon options]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  <a href="scache.8.html"><b>scache</b>(8)</a>  server maintains a shared multi-connection
       cache. This information can be used by, for example, Post-
       fix SMTP clients or other Postfix delivery agents.

       The connection cache is organized into logical destination
       names, physical endpoint names, and connections.

       As a specific example, logical SMTP  destinations  specify
       (transport,  domain,  port),  and  physical SMTP endpoints
       specify (transport, IP address, port).  An SMTP connection
       may be saved after a successful mail transaction.

       In  the general case, one logical destination may refer to
       zero or more physical endpoints, one physical endpoint may
       be  referenced  by  zero or more logical destinations, and
       one endpoint may refer to zero or more connections.

       The exact syntax of a logical destination or endpoint name
       is  application  dependent;  the <a href="scache.8.html"><b>scache</b>(8)</a> server does not
       care.   A  connection  is  stored  as  a  file  descriptor
       together  with  application-dependent  information that is
       needed to re-activate  a  connection  object.  Again,  the
       <a href="scache.8.html"><b>scache</b>(8)</a>  server  is completely unaware of the details of
       that information.

       All information is stored  with  a  finite  time  to  live
       (ttl).   The  connection  cache  daemon terminates when no
       client is connected for <b><a href="postconf.5.html#max_idle">max_idle</a></b> time units.

       This server implements the following requests:

       <b>save_endp</b> <i>ttl endpoint endpoint</i><b>_</b><i>properties file</i><b>_</b><i>descriptor</i>
              Save the specified file descriptor  and  connection
              property  data  under  the specified endpoint name.
              The endpoint properties are used by the  client  to
              re-activate a passivated connection object.

       <b>find_endp</b> <i>endpoint</i>
              Look   up  cached  properties  and  a  cached  file
              descriptor for the specified endpoint.

       <b>save_dest</b> <i>ttl destination destination</i><b>_</b><i>properties endpoint</i>
              Save the binding between a logical destination  and
              an  endpoint  under  the destination name, together
              with destination  specific  connection  properties.
              The  destination  properties are used by the client
              to re-activate a passivated connection object.

       <b>find_dest</b> <i>destination</i>
              Look up cached destination properties, cached  end-
              point  properties, and a cached file descriptor for
              the specified logical destination.

<b>SECURITY</b>
       The <a href="scache.8.html"><b>scache</b>(8)</a> server is not  security-sensitive.  It  does
       not  talk  to  the  network, and it does not talk to local
       users.  The <a href="scache.8.html"><b>scache</b>(8)</a> server can run chrooted at fixed low
       privilege.

       The <a href="scache.8.html"><b>scache</b>(8)</a> server is not a trusted process. It must not
       be used to store information that is security sensitive.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Problems and transactions are logged to <b>syslogd</b>(8).

<b>BUGS</b>
       The  session  cache  cannot  be  shared   among   multiple
       machines.

       When  a  connection  expires  from the cache, it is closed
       without the appropriate protocol specific handshake.

<b>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS</b>
       Changes  to  <a href="postconf.5.html"><b>main.cf</b></a>  are  picked  up   automatically   as
       <a href="scache.8.html"><b>scache</b>(8)</a> processes run for only a limited amount of time.
       Use the command "<b>postfix reload</b>" to speed up a change.
