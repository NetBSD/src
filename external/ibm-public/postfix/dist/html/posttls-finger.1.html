POSTTLS-FINGER(1)           General Commands Manual          POSTTLS-FINGER(1)

<b>NAME</b>
       posttls-finger - Probe the TLS properties of an ESMTP or LMTP server.

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>posttls-finger</b> [<i>options</i>] [<b>inet:</b>]<i>domain</i>[:<i>port</i>] [<i>match ...</i>]
       <b>posttls-finger</b> -S [<i>options</i>] <b>unix:</b><i>pathname</i> [<i>match ...</i>]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <a href="posttls-finger.1.html"><b>posttls-finger</b>(1)</a>  connects  to  the  specified destination and reports
       TLS-related information about the server. With SMTP, the destination is
       a  domainname;  with LMTP it is either a domainname prefixed with <b>inet:</b>
       or a pathname prefixed with <b>unix:</b>.  If Postfix  is  built  without  TLS
       support,  the  resulting  posttls-finger program has very limited func-
       tionality, and only the <b>-a</b>, <b>-c</b>, <b>-h</b>, <b>-o</b>, <b>-S</b>, <b>-t</b>, <b>-T</b> and <b>-v</b>  options  are
       available.

       Note:  this is an unsupported test program. No attempt is made to main-
       tain compatibility between successive versions.

       For SMTP servers that don't support ESMTP, only the greeting banner and
       the  negative  EHLO response are reported. Otherwise, the reported EHLO
       response details further server capabilities.

       If TLS support is enabled when <a href="posttls-finger.1.html"><b>posttls-finger</b>(1)</a> is compiled,  and  the
       server supports <b>STARTTLS</b>, a TLS handshake is attempted.

       If  DNSSEC  support is available, the connection TLS security level (<b>-l</b>
       option) defaults to <b>dane</b>; see <a href="TLS_README.html">TLS_README</a>  for  details.  Otherwise,  it
       defaults  to  <b>secure</b>.  This setting determines the certificate matching
       policy.

       If TLS negotiation succeeds, the TLS protocol and  cipher  details  are
       reported.  The  server  certificate is then verified in accordance with
       the policy at the chosen (or  default)  security  level.   With  public
       CA-based  trust,  when  the  <b>-L</b>  option  includes  <b>certmatch</b>,  (true by
       default) name matching is performed even if the  certificate  chain  is
       not  trusted.  This logs the names found in the remote SMTP server cer-
       tificate and which if any  would  match,  were  the  certificate  chain
       trusted.

       Note:  <a href="posttls-finger.1.html"><b>posttls-finger</b>(1)</a> does not perform any table lookups, so the TLS
       policy table and obsolete per-site tables are not consulted.   It  does
       not  communicate  with  the <a href="tlsmgr.8.html"><b>tlsmgr</b>(8)</a> daemon (or any other Postfix dae-
       mons); its TLS session cache is held in private memory, and  disappears
       when the process exits.

       With  the  <b>-r</b> <i>delay</i> option, if the server assigns a TLS session id, the
       TLS session is cached. The connection  is  then  closed  and  re-opened
       after  the  specified delay, and <a href="posttls-finger.1.html"><b>posttls-finger</b>(1)</a> then reports whether
       the cached TLS session was re-used.

       When the destination is a load balancer, it may  be  distributing  load
       between  multiple  server  caches.  Typically,  each server returns its
       unique name in its EHLO response. If, upon reconnecting with <b>-r</b>, a  new
       server  name is detected, another session is cached for the new server,
       and the reconnect is repeated up to a maximum number of times  (default
       5) that can be specified via the <b>-m</b> option.

       The  choice  of  SMTP  or LMTP (<b>-S</b> option) determines the syntax of the
       destination argument. With  SMTP,  one  can  specify  a  service  on  a
       non-default  port  as <i>host</i>:<i>service</i>, and disable MX (mail exchanger) DNS
       lookups with [<i>host</i>] or [<i>host</i>]:<i>port</i>.  The [] form is required  when  you
       specify an IP address instead of a hostname.  An IPv6 address takes the
       form [<b>ipv6:</b><i>address</i>].  The default port  for  SMTP  is  taken  from  the
       <b>smtp/tcp</b>  entry  in /etc/services, defaulting to 25 if the entry is not
       found.

       With LMTP, specify <b>unix:</b><i>pathname</i> to connect to a local server listening
       on  a  unix-domain  socket  bound to the specified pathname; otherwise,
       specify an optional <b>inet:</b> prefix followed by a <i>domain</i> and  an  optional
       port,  with  the same syntax as for SMTP. The default TCP port for LMTP
       is 24.

       Arguments:

       <b>-a</b> <i>family</i> (default: <b>any</b>)
              Address family preference: <b>ipv4</b>, <b>ipv6</b> or <b>any</b>.  When  using  <b>any</b>,
              posttls-finger  will  randomly select one of the two as the more
              preferred, and exhaust all MX preferences for the first  address
              family before trying any addresses for the other.

       <b>-A</b> <i>trust-anchor.pem</i> (default: none)
              A  list of PEM trust-anchor files that overrides CAfile and CAp-
              ath trust chain verification.  Specify the option multiple times
              to  specify  multiple  files.  See the <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a> documentation for
              <a href="postconf.5.html#smtp_tls_trust_anchor_file">smtp_tls_trust_anchor_file</a> for details.

       <b>-c</b>     Disable SMTP  chat  logging;  only  TLS-related  information  is
              logged.

       <b>-C</b>     Print the remote SMTP server certificate trust chain in PEM for-
              mat.  The issuer DN, subject DN, certificate and public key fin-
              gerprints (see <b>-d</b> <i>mdalg</i> option below) are printed above each PEM
              certificate block.  If you specify <b>-F</b> <i>CAfile</i> or <b>-P</b>  <i>CApath</i>,  the
              OpenSSL  library  may augment the chain with missing issuer cer-
              tificates.  To see the actual chain  sent  by  the  remote  SMTP
              server leave <i>CAfile</i> and <i>CApath</i> unset.

       <b>-d</b> <i>mdalg</i> (default: <b>sha1</b>)
              The  message  digest  algorithm to use for reporting remote SMTP
              server fingerprints and matching against user provided  certifi-
              cate fingerprints (with DANE TLSA records the algorithm is spec-
              ified in the DNS).

       <b>-f</b>     Lookup the associated DANE TLSA RRset even when  a  hostname  is
              not  an  alias  and its address records lie in an unsigned zone.
              See <a href="postconf.5.html#smtp_tls_force_insecure_host_tlsa_lookup">smtp_tls_force_insecure_host_tlsa_lookup</a> for details.

       <b>-F</b> <i>CAfile.pem</i> (default: none)
              The PEM formatted CAfile for remote SMTP server certificate ver-
              ification.   By  default no CAfile is used and no public CAs are
              trusted.

       <b>-g</b> <i>grade</i> (default: medium)
              The minimum  TLS  cipher  grade  used  by  posttls-finger.   See
              <a href="postconf.5.html#smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers">smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers</a> for details.

       <b>-h</b> <i>host</i><b>_</b><i>lookup</i> (default: <b>dns</b>)
              The  hostname  lookup  methods used for the connection.  See the
              documentation of <a href="postconf.5.html#smtp_host_lookup">smtp_host_lookup</a> for syntax and semantics.

       <b>-k</b> <i>certfile</i> (default: <i>keyfile</i>)
              File  with  PEM-encoded  TLS  client  certificate  chain.   This
              defaults to <i>keyfile</i> if one is specified.

       <b>-K</b> <i>keyfile</i> (default: <i>certfile</i>)
              File  with PEM-encoded TLS client private key.  This defaults to
              <i>certfile</i> if one is specified.

       <b>-l</b> <i>level</i> (default: <b>dane</b> or <b>secure</b>)
              The security level for the connection, default  <b>dane</b>  or  <b>secure</b>
              depending on whether DNSSEC is available.  For syntax and seman-
              tics, see the documentation  of  <a href="postconf.5.html#smtp_tls_security_level">smtp_tls_security_level</a>.   When
              <b>dane</b>  or <b>dane-only</b> is supported and selected, if no TLSA records
              are found, or all the records found  are  unusable,  the  <i>secure</i>
              level  will  be  used  instead.   The <b>fingerprint</b> security level
              allows you to test certificate or public-key fingerprint matches
              before you deploy them in the policy table.

              Note,  since <b>posttls-finger</b> does not actually deliver any email,
              the <b>none</b>, <b>may</b> and <b>encrypt</b> security levels are not  very  useful.
              Since <b>may</b> and <b>encrypt</b> don't require peer certificates, they will
              often negotiate anonymous TLS ciphersuites, so you  won't  learn
              much about the remote SMTP server's certificates at these levels
              if it also supports anonymous TLS (though you may learn that the
              server supports anonymous TLS).

       <b>-L</b> <i>logopts</i> (default: <b>routine,certmatch</b>)
              Fine-grained  TLS  logging  options.  To  tune  the TLS features
              logged during the TLS handshake, specify one or more of:

              <b>0, none</b>
                     These yield no TLS logging; you'll generally  want  more,
                     but this is handy if you just want the trust chain:
                     $ posttls-finger -cC -L none destination

              <b>1, routine, summary</b>
                     These  synonymous  values yield a normal one-line summary
                     of the TLS connection.

              <b>2, debug</b>
                     These synonymous values combine routine, ssl-debug, cache
                     and verbose.

              <b>3, ssl-expert</b>
                     These  synonymous  values  combine  debug  with ssl-hand-
                     shake-packet-dump.  For experts only.

              <b>4, ssl-developer</b>
                     These synonymous values combine ssl-expert with  ssl-ses-
                     sion-packet-dump.   For  experts only, and in most cases,
                     use wireshark instead.

              <b>ssl-debug</b>
                     Turn on OpenSSL logging of the progress of the SSL  hand-
                     shake.

              <b>ssl-handshake-packet-dump</b>
                     Log  hexadecimal  packet  dumps of the SSL handshake; for
                     experts only.

              <b>ssl-session-packet-dump</b>
                     Log hexadecimal packet dumps of the entire  SSL  session;
                     only  useful to those who can debug SSL protocol problems
                     from hex dumps.

              <b>untrusted</b>
                     Logs trust chain verification problems.  This  is  turned
                     on  automatically  at security levels that use peer names
                     signed by Certification Authorities to validate  certifi-
                     cates.   So  while this setting is recognized, you should
                     never need to set it explicitly.

              <b>peercert</b>
                     This logs a one line summary of the  remote  SMTP  server
                     certificate subject, issuer, and fingerprints.

              <b>certmatch</b>
                     This  logs remote SMTP server certificate matching, show-
                     ing  the  CN  and  each  subjectAltName  and  which  name
                     matched.    With  DANE,  logs  matching  of  TLSA  record
                     trust-anchor and end-entity certificates.

              <b>cache</b>  This logs session cache operations, showing whether  ses-
                     sion  caching  is  effective with the remote SMTP server.
                     Automatically used when reconnecting with the <b>-r</b>  option;
                     rarely needs to be set explicitly.

              <b>verbose</b>
                     Enables  verbose  logging  in  the  Postfix  TLS  driver;
                     includes all of peercert..cache and more.

              The default is <b>routine,certmatch</b>. After a  reconnect,  <b>peercert</b>,
              <b>certmatch</b> and <b>verbose</b> are automatically disabled while <b>cache</b> and
              <b>summary</b> are enabled.

       <b>-m</b> <i>count</i> (default: <b>5</b>)
              When the <b>-r</b> <i>delay</i> option is specified, the <b>-m</b> option  determines
              the  maximum  number  of reconnect attempts to use with a server
              behind a load balancer, to see  whether  connection  caching  is
              likely  to  be  effective for this destination.  Some MTAs don't
              expose the underlying server identity in  their  EHLO  response;
              with  these servers there will never be more than 1 reconnection
              attempt.

       <b>-M</b> <i>insecure</i><b>_</b><i>mx</i><b>_</b><i>policy</i> (default: <b>dane</b>)
              The TLS policy for MX hosts with "secure" TLSA records when  the
              nexthop  destination  security  level is <b>dane</b>, but the MX record
              was found via an "insecure" MX lookup.  See the <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a> documen-
              tation for smtp_tls_insecure_mx_policy for details.

       <b>-o</b> <i>name=value</i>
              Specify  zero or more times to override the value of the <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>
              parameter <i>name</i> with <i>value</i>.  Possible use-cases include  overrid-
              ing  the  values  of  TLS library parameters, or "<a href="postconf.5.html#myhostname">myhostname</a>" to
              configure the SMTP EHLO name sent to the remote server.

       <b>-p</b> <i>protocols</i> (default: !SSLv2)
              List of  TLS  protocols  that  posttls-finger  will  exclude  or
              include.  See <a href="postconf.5.html#smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols">smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols</a> for details.

       <b>-P</b> <i>CApath/</i> (default: none)
              The  OpenSSL  CApath/  directory  (indexed  via c_rehash(1)) for
              remote SMTP server certificate verification.  By default no CAp-
              ath is used and no public CAs are trusted.

       <b>-r</b> <i>delay</i>
              With  a  cacheable  TLS  session, disconnect and reconnect after
              <i>delay</i> seconds. Report whether the session is re-used. Retry if a
              new  server  is  encountered, up to 5 times or as specified with
              the <b>-m</b> option.  By default reconnection is disabled,  specify  a
              positive delay to enable this behavior.

       <b>-S</b>     Disable  SMTP;  that  is, connect to an LMTP server. The default
              port for LMTP over TCP is 24.  Alternative ports  can  specified
              by  appending "<i>:servicename</i>" or ":<i>portnumber</i>" to the destination
              argument.

       <b>-t</b> <i>timeout</i> (default: <b>30</b>)
              The TCP connection timeout to use.  This is also the timeout for
              reading the remote server's 220 banner.

       <b>-T</b> <i>timeout</i> (default: <b>30</b>)
              The SMTP/LMTP command timeout for EHLO/LHLO, STARTTLS and QUIT.

       <b>-v</b>     Enable  verbose  Postfix  logging.   Specify  more  than once to
              increase the level of verbose logging.

       <b>-w</b>     Enable outgoing TLS wrapper mode, or  SMTPS  support.   This  is
              typically  provided  on  port 465 by servers that are compatible
              with the ad-hoc SMTP in SSL protocol, rather than  the  standard
              STARTTLS protocol.  The destination <i>domain</i>:<i>port</i> should of course
              provide such a service.

       [<b>inet:</b>]<i>domain</i>[:<i>port</i>]
              Connect via TCP to domain <i>domain</i>, port <i>port</i>. The default port is
              <b>smtp</b>  (or 24 with LMTP).  With SMTP an MX lookup is performed to
              resolve the domain to a host, unless the domain is  enclosed  in
              <b>[]</b>.   If you want to connect to a specific MX host, for instance
              <i>mx1.example.com</i>, specify [<i>mx1.example.com</i>]  as  the  destination
              and <i>example.com</i> as a <b>match</b> argument.  When using DNS, the desti-
              nation domain is assumed fully qualified and no  default  domain
              or  search  suffixes  are  applied; you must use fully-qualified
              names or also enable <b>native</b> host lookups  (these  don't  support
              <b>dane</b>  or <b>dane-only</b> as no DNSSEC validation information is avail-
              able via <b>native</b> lookups).

       <b>unix:</b><i>pathname</i>
              Connect to the UNIX-domain socket at <i>pathname</i>. LMTP only.

       <b>match ...</b>
              With no match arguments specified, certificate peername matching
              uses the compiled-in default strategies for each security level.
              If you specify one or more arguments, these will be used as  the
              list  of certificate or public-key digests to match for the <b>fin-</b>
              <b>gerprint</b> level, or as the list of DNS names to match in the cer-
              tificate at the <b>verify</b> and <b>secure</b> levels.  If the security level
              is <b>dane</b>, or <b>dane-only</b> the match names are ignored, and <b>hostname,</b>
              <b>nexthop</b> strategies are used.

<b>ENVIRONMENT</b>
       <b>MAIL_CONFIG</b>
              Read configuration parameters from a non-default location.

       <b>MAIL_VERBOSE</b>
              Same as <b>-v</b> option.
