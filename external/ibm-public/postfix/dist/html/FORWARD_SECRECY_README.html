TLS Forward Secrecy in Postfix
</h1>

<hr>

<h2> Warning </h2>

<p> Forward secrecy does not protect against active attacks such
as forged DNS replies or forged TLS server certificates. If such
attacks are a concern, then the SMTP client will need to authenticate
the remote SMTP server in a sufficiently-secure manner.  For example,
by the fingerprint of a (CA or leaf) public key or certificate.
Conventional PKI relies on many trusted parties and is easily
subverted by a state-funded adversary.  </p>

<h2> Overview </h2>

<p> Postfix supports forward secrecy of TLS network communication
since version 2.2. This support was adopted from Lutz J&auml;nicke's
"Postfix TLS patch" for earlier Postfix versions.  This document
will focus on TLS Forward Secrecy in the Postfix SMTP client and
server.  See <a href="TLS_README.html">TLS_README</a> for a general
description of Postfix TLS support. </p>

<h2><a name="dfn_fs">What is Forward Secrecy</a></h2>

<p> The term "Forward Secrecy" (or sometimes "Perfect Forward Secrecy")
is used to describe security protocols in which the confidentiality
of past traffic is not compromised when long-term keys used by either
or both sides are later disclosed.  </p>

<p> Forward secrecy is accomplished by negotiating session keys
using per-session cryptographically-strong random numbers that are
not saved, and signing the exchange with long-term authentication
keys.  Later disclosure of the long-term keys allows impersonation
of the key holder from that point on, but not recovery of prior
traffic, since with forward secrecy, the discarded random key
agreement inputs are not available to the attacker. </p>

<p> Forward secrecy is only "perfect" when brute-force attacks on
the key agreement algorithm are impractical even for the best-funded
adversary and the random-number generators used by both parties are
sufficiently strong.  Otherwise, forward secrecy leaves the attacker
with the challenge of cracking the key-agreement protocol, which
is likely quite computationally intensive, but may be feasible for
sessions of sufficiently high value.  Thus forward secrecy places
cost constraints on the efficacy of bulk surveillance, recovering
all past traffic is generally infeasible, and even recovery of
individual sessions may be infeasible given a sufficiently-strong
key agreement method. </p>

<h2><a name="tls_fs">Forward Secrecy in TLS</a></h2>

<p> Early implementations of the SSL protocol do not provide forward
secrecy (some provide it only with artificially-weakened "export"
cipher suites, but we will ignore those here). The client
sends a random "pre-master secret" to the server encrypted with the
server's RSA public key.  The server decrypts this with its private
key, and uses it together with other data exchanged in the clear
to generate the session key.  An attacker with access to the server's
private key can perform the same computation at any later time.
The TLS library in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 only supported
cipher suites of this type, and Exchange 2003 servers largely do
not support forward secrecy.  </p>

<p> Later revisions to the TLS protocol introduced forward-secrecy
cipher suites in which the client and server implement a key exchange
protocol based on ephemeral secrets.  Sessions encrypted with one
of these newer cipher suites are not compromised by future disclosure
of long-term authentication keys. </p>

<p> The key-exchange algorithms used for forward secrecy require
the TLS server to designate appropriate "parameters" consisting of a
mathematical "group" and an element of that group called a "generator".
Presently, there are two flavors of "groups" that work with PFS: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> <b> Prime-field groups (EDH):</b>  The server needs to be
configured with a suitably-large prime and a corresponding "generator".
The acronym for forward secrecy over prime fields is EDH for Ephemeral
Diffie-Hellman (also abbreviated as DHE).
</p>

<li> <p> <b> Elliptic-curve groups (EECDH): </b>  The server needs
to be configured with a "named curve".  These offer better security
at lower computational cost than prime field groups, but are not
as widely implemented.  The acronym for the elliptic curve version
is EECDH which is short for Ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
(also abbreviated as ECDHE). </p>

</ul>

<p> It is not essential to know what these are, but one does need
to know that OpenSSL supports EECDH with version 1.0.0 or later.
Thus the configuration parameters related to Elliptic-Curve forward
secrecy are available when Postfix is linked with OpenSSL &ge; 1.0.0
(provided EC support has not been disabled by the vendor, as in
some versions of RedHat Linux).  </p>

<p> Elliptic curves used in cryptography are typically identified
by a "name" that stands for a set of well-known parameter values,
and it is these "names" (or associated ASN.1 object identifiers)
that are used in the TLS protocol.  On the other hand, with TLS there
are no specially designated prime field groups, so each server is
free to select its own suitably-strong prime and generator.  </p>

<h2><a name="server_fs">Forward Secrecy in the Postfix SMTP Server</a></h2>

<p> The Postfix &ge; 2.2 SMTP server supports forward secrecy in
its default configuration.  If the remote SMTP client prefers cipher
suites with forward secrecy, then the traffic between the server
and client will resist decryption even if the server's long-term
authentication keys are <i>later</i> compromised. </p>

<p> Some remote SMTP clients may support forward secrecy, but prefer
cipher suites <i>without</i> forward secrecy. In that case, Postfix
&ge; 2.8 could be configured to ignore the client's preference with
the <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a> setting "<a href="postconf.5.html#tls_preempt_cipherlist">tls_preempt_cipherlist</a> = yes".  However, this
will likely cause interoperability issues with older Exchange servers
and is not recommended for now.  </p>

<h3> EDH Server support </h3>

<p> Postfix &ge; 2.2 support 1024-bit-prime EDH out of the box,
with no additional configuration, but you may want to override the
default prime to be 2048 bits long, and you may want to regenerate
your primes periodically. See the <a href="#quick-start">quick-start</a>
section for details.  </p>

<p> With prime-field EDH, OpenSSL wants the server to provide
two explicitly-selected (prime, generator) combinations.  One for
the now long-obsolete "export" cipher suites, and another for
non-export cipher suites.  Postfix has two such default combinations
compiled in, but also supports explicitly-configured overrides.
</p>

<ul>

<li> <p> The "export" EDH parameters are used only with the obsolete
"export" ciphers.  To use a non-default prime, generate a 512-bit
DH parameter file and set <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_tls_dh512_param_file">smtpd_tls_dh512_param_file</a> to the filename
(see the <a href="#quick-start">quick-start</a> section for details).
</p>

<li> <p> The non-export EDH parameters are used for all other EDH
cipher suites.  To use a non-default prime, generate a 1024-bit or
2048-bit DH parameter file and set <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_tls_dh1024_param_file">smtpd_tls_dh1024_param_file</a> to
the filename.  Despite the name this is simply the non-export
parameter file and the prime need not actually be 1024 bits long
(see the <a href="#quick-start">quick-start</a> section for details).
</p>

</ul>

<p> It turns out that (inadvisably-patched in some Debian releases)
Exim SMTP clients require a &ge; 2048-bit length for the non-export
prime.  See the <a href="#quick-start">quick-start</a> section for
the recommended configuration to work around this issue.  </p>

<h3> EECDH Server support </h3>

<p> Postfix &ge; 2.6 support NIST P-256 EECDH when built with OpenSSL
&ge; 1.0.0.  When the remote SMTP client also supports EECDH and
implements the P-256 curve, forward secrecy just works.  </p>

<blockquote> <p> Note: With Postfix 2.6 and 2.7, enable EECDH by
setting the <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a> parameter <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_tls_eecdh_grade">smtpd_tls_eecdh_grade</a> to "strong".
</p> </blockquote>

<p> The elliptic curve situation is evolving, with new curves being
introduced to augment or replace the NIST curves tarnished by the
Snowden revelations.  Fortunately, TLS clients advertise the list
of supported curves to the server so that servers can in principle
choose newer stronger curves when mutually supported.  The OpenSSL
code for making this possible is not yet released as of late 2013
(it is available only in OpenSSL development snapshots). </p>

<p> At some point Postfix will need to adjust to the new API for
setting the elliptic-curve options.  Fortunately, when EECDH support
was added to Postfix, it introduced a layer of indirection: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
    <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_tls_eecdh_grade">smtpd_tls_eecdh_grade</a> = strong | ultra
    <a href="postconf.5.html#tls_eecdh_strong_curve">tls_eecdh_strong_curve</a> = prime256v1
    <a href="postconf.5.html#tls_eecdh_ultra_curve">tls_eecdh_ultra_curve</a> = secp384r1
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> When it becomes possible in OpenSSL to support a "menu" of
curves, we will likely extend "<a href="postconf.5.html#tls_eecdh_strong_curve">tls_eecdh_strong_curve</a>" to be an
ordered list of curves and likewise with the "ultra" version, where
the two might now overlap, and differ mostly in the preference
order.  As a result most existing configurations will then support
more curves at the desired security level without any changes to
<a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>. </p>

<h2> <a name="client_fs">Forward Secrecy in the Postfix SMTP Client</a> </h2>

<p> The Postfix &ge; 2.2 SMTP client supports forward secrecy in
its default configuration.  No configuration changes are needed
besides turning on elliptic-curve support with Postfix 2.6 and 2.7
(see the <a href="#quick-start"> quick-start</a> section).  If the
remote SMTP server supports cipher suites with forward secrecy (and
does not override the SMTP client's cipher preference), then the
traffic between the server and client will resist decryption even
if the server's long-term authentication keys are <i>later</i>
compromised.  </p>

<p> The default Postfix SMTP client cipher lists are correctly
ordered to prefer EECDH and EDH cipher suites ahead of similar
cipher suites that don't implement forward secrecy.  Administrators
are strongly discouraged from changing the cipher list definitions.
It is likely safe to set "<a href="postconf.5.html#smtp_tls_ciphers">smtp_tls_ciphers</a> = medium" if you wish
to disable the obsolete "export" and "low" grade ciphers even with
opportunistic TLS.  Setting a minimum strength does not change the
preference
order.  Note that strengths higher than "medium" exclude Exchange
2003 and likely other widely used MTAs, thus "high" grade ciphers
should only be used on a case-by-case basis via the <a
href="TLS_README.html#client_tls_policy">TLS policy</a> table. </p>

<h2><a name="quick-start">Getting started, quick and dirty</a></h2>

<h3> EECDH Client and server support (Postfix &ge; 2.6 with OpenSSL
&ge; 1.0.0) </h3>

<p> With Postfix 2.6 and 2.7, enable elliptic-curve support in the
Postfix SMTP client and server. This is the default with Postfix
&ge; 2.8. Note, however, that elliptic-curve support may be disabled
by the vendor, as in some versions of RedHat Linux. </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
/etc/postfix/<a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>:
    # Postfix 2.6 or 2.7 only. This is default with Postfix 2.8 and later.
    <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_tls_eecdh_grade">smtpd_tls_eecdh_grade</a> = strong
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3> EDH Client support (Postfix &ge; 2.2, all supported OpenSSL
versions) </h3>

<p> This works "out of the box" without additional configuration. </p>

<h3> EDH Server support (Postfix &ge; 2.2, all supported OpenSSL
versions) </h3>

<p> Optionally generate non-default Postfix SMTP server EDH parameters
for improved security against pre-computation attacks and for
compatibility with Debian-patched Exim SMTP clients that require a
&ge; 2048-bit length for the non-export prime. </p>

<p> Execute as root (prime group generation can take a
few seconds to a few minutes): </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
# cd /etc/postfix
# umask 022
# openssl dhparam -out dh512.tmp 512 && mv dh512.tmp dh512.pem
# openssl dhparam -out dh1024.tmp 1024 && mv dh1024.tmp dh1024.pem
# openssl dhparam -out dh2048.tmp 2048 && mv dh2048.tmp dh2048.pem
# chmod 644 dh512.pem dh1024.pem dh2048.pem
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> The Postfix SMTP server EDH parameter files are not secret,
after all these parameters are sent to all remote SMTP clients in
the clear. Mode 0644 is fine. </p>

<p> You can improve security against pre-computation attacks further
by regenerating the Postfix SMTP server EDH parameters periodically
(an hourly or daily cron job running the above commands as root can
automate this task). </p>

<p> Once the parameters are in place, update <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a> as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
/etc/postfix/<a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>:
    <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_tls_dh1024_param_file">smtpd_tls_dh1024_param_file</a> = ${<a href="postconf.5.html#config_directory">config_directory</a>}/dh2048.pem
    <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_tls_dh512_param_file">smtpd_tls_dh512_param_file</a> = ${<a href="postconf.5.html#config_directory">config_directory</a>}/dh512.pem
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> If some of your MSA clients don't support 2048-bit EDH, you may
need to adjust the submission entry in <a href="master.5.html">master.cf</a> accordingly: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
/etc/postfix/<a href="master.5.html">master.cf</a>:
    submission inet n       -       n       -       -       smtpd
        # Some submission clients may not yet do 2048-bit EDH, if such
        # clients use your MSA, configure 1024-bit EDH instead:
        -o <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_tls_dh1024_param_file">smtpd_tls_dh1024_param_file</a>=${<a href="postconf.5.html#config_directory">config_directory</a>}/dh1024.pem
        -o <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_tls_security_level">smtpd_tls_security_level</a>=encrypt
        -o <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_sasl_auth_enable">smtpd_sasl_auth_enable</a>=yes
        ...
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="test">How can I see that a connection has forward
secrecy? </a> </h2>

<p> Postfix can be configured to report information about the
negotiated cipher, the corresponding key lengths, and the remote
peer certificate or public-key verification status.  </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> With "<a href="postconf.5.html#smtp_tls_loglevel">smtp_tls_loglevel</a> = 1" and "<a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_tls_loglevel">smtpd_tls_loglevel</a> = 1",
the Postfix SMTP client and server will log TLS connection information
to the maillog file. The general logfile format is: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
postfix/smtp[<i>process-id</i>]: Untrusted TLS connection established
to host.example.com[192.168.0.2]:25: TLSv1 with cipher <i>cipher-name</i>

from host.example.com[192.168.0.2]: TLSv1 with cipher <i>cipher-name</i>

</pre>
</blockquote>

<li> <p> With "<a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_tls_received_header">smtpd_tls_received_header</a> = yes", the Postfix SMTP
server will record TLS connection information in the Received:
header in the form of comments (text inside parentheses). The general
format depends on the <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_tls_ask_ccert">smtpd_tls_ask_ccert</a> setting:

<blockquote>
<pre>

<h2><a name="ciphers"> What ciphers provide forward secrecy? </a> </h2>

<p> There are dozens of ciphers that support forward secrecy.  What
follows is the beginning of a list of 51 ciphers available with
OpenSSL 1.0.1e.  The list is sorted in the default Postfix preference
order.  It excludes null ciphers that only authenticate and don't
encrypt, together with export and low-grade ciphers whose encryption
is too weak to offer meaningful secrecy. The first column shows the
cipher name, and the second shows the key exchange method.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p> To date, all ciphers that support forward secrecy have one of
five values for the first component of their OpenSSL name: "AECDH",
"ECDHE", "ADH", "EDH" or "DHE".  Ciphers that don't implement forward
secrecy have names that don't start with one of these prefixes.
This pattern is likely to persist until some new key-exchange
mechanism is invented that also supports forward secrecy.  </p>

<p> The actual key length and raw algorithm key length 
are generally the same with non-export ciphers, but may they
differ for the legacy export ciphers where the actual key 
is artificially shortened. </p>

<h2><a name="status"> What do "Anonymous", "Untrusted", etc. in
Postfix logging mean? </a> </h2>

<p> The verification levels below are subject to man-in-the-middle
attacks to different degrees.  If such attacks are a concern, then
the SMTP client will need to authenticate the remote SMTP server
in a sufficiently-secure manner. For example, by the fingerprint
of a (CA or leaf) public key or certificate.  Remember that
conventional PKI relies on many trusted parties and is easily
subverted by a state-funded adversary.  </p>

<dl>

<dt><b>Anonymous</b> (no peer certificate)</dt>

<dd> <p> <b> Postfix SMTP client:</b> With opportunistic TLS (the "may" security level) the Postfix
SMTP client does not verify any information in the peer certificate.
In this case it enables and prefers anonymous cipher suites in which
the remote SMTP server does not present a certificate (these ciphers
offer forward secrecy of necessity).  When the remote SMTP server
also supports anonymous TLS, and agrees to such a cipher suite, the
verification status will be logged as "Anonymous".  </p> </dd>

<dd> <p> <b> Postfix SMTP server:</b> This is by far most common,
as client certificates are optional, and the Postfix SMTP server
does not request client certificates by default (see <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_tls_ask_ccert">smtpd_tls_ask_ccert</a>).
Even when client certificates are requested, the remote SMTP client
might not send a certificate.  Unlike the Postfix SMTP client, the
Postfix SMTP server "anonymous" verification status does not imply
that the cipher suite is anonymous, which corresponds to the
<i>server</i> not sending a certificate.  </p> </dd>

<dt><b>Untrusted</b> (peer certificate not signed by trusted CA)</dt>

<dd>

<p> <b> Postfix SMTP client:</b> The remote SMTP server presented
a certificate, but the Postfix SMTP client was unable to check the

remote SMTP servers that don't support anonymous cipher suites.
</p>

<p> <b> Postfix SMTP server:</b> The remote SMTP client presented
a certificate, but the Postfix SMTP server was unable to check the

<dt><b>Trusted</b> (peer certificate signed by trusted CA, unverified

<dd>

<p> <b> Postfix SMTP client:</b> The remote SMTP server's certificate
was signed by a CA that the Postfix SMTP client trusts, but either
the client was not configured to verify the destination server name

any matching names.  This is common with opportunistic TLS
(<a href="postconf.5.html#smtp_tls_security_level">smtp_tls_security_level</a> is "may" or else "dane" with no usable
TLSA DNS records) when the Postfix SMTP client's trusted CAs can

but the client is not configured or unable to verify the server
name. </p>

<p> <b> Postfix SMTP server:</b> The remote SMTP client certificate
was signed by a CA that the Postfix SMTP server trusts.  The Postfix
SMTP server never verifies the remote SMTP client name against the

<dd>

<p> <b> Postfix SMTP client:</b> The remote SMTP server's certificate
was signed by a CA that the Postfix SMTP client trusts, and the

The expected fingerprint may come from <a href="postconf.5.html#smtp_tls_policy_maps">smtp_tls_policy_maps</a> or from
TLSA (secure) DNS records.  The Postfix SMTP client ignores the CA
signature.  </p>

<p> <b> Postfix SMTP server:</b> The status is never "Verified",
because the Postfix SMTP server never verifies the remote SMTP
