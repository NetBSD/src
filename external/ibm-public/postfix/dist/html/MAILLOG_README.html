logging to file or stdout</h1>

<h2>Overview </h2>

<p> Postfix supports it own logging system as an alternative to
syslog (which remains the default). This is available with Postfix
version 3.4 or later. </p>

<h2> <a name="log-to-file"> Configuring logging to file </a> </h2>

<p> Logging to file solves a usability problem for MacOS, and
eliminates multiple problems for systemd-based systems. </p>

<ol>

<li> <p> Add the following line to <a href="master.5.html">master.cf</a> if not already present
(note: there must be no whitespace at the start of the line): </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
postlog   unix-dgram n  -       n       -       1       postlogd
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> Note: the service type "<b>unix-dgram</b>" was introduced with 
Postfix 3.4. Remove the above line before backing out to an older
Postfix version. </p>

<li> <p> Configure Postfix to write logging, to, for example,
/var/log/postfix.log. See also the "<a href="#logrotate">Logfile
rotation</a>" section below for logfile management. </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
# postfix stop
# postconf <a href="postconf.5.html#maillog_file">maillog_file</a>=/var/log/postfix.log
# postfix start
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> By default, the logfile name must start with "/var" or "/dev/stdout"
(the list of allowed prefixes is configured with the <a href="postconf.5.html#maillog_file_prefixes">maillog_file_prefixes</a>
parameter). This safety mechanism limits the damage from a single
configuration mistake. </p>

</ol>

<h2> <a name="log-to-stdout"> Configuring logging to stdout </a> </h2>

<p> Logging to stdout is useful when Postfix runs in a container,
as it eliminates a syslogd dependency. </p>

<ol>

<li> <p> Add the following line to <a href="master.5.html">master.cf</a> if not already present (note:
there must be no whitespace at the start of the line): </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
postlog   unix-dgram n  -       n       -       1       postlogd
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> Note: the service type "<b>unix-dgram</b>" was introduced with 
Postfix 3.4. Remove the above line before backing out to an older
Postfix version. </p>

<li> <p> Configure <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a> with "<a href="postconf.5.html#maillog_file">maillog_file</a> = /dev/stdout". </p> 

<li> <p> Start Postfix with "<b>postfix start-fg</b>". </p>

</ol>

<h2> <a name="logrotate"> Rotating logs </a> </h2>

<p> The command "<b>postfix logrotate</b>" may be run by hand or
by a cronjob. It logs all errors, and reports errors to stderr if
run from a terminal. This command implements the following steps:
</p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Rename the current logfile by appending a suffix that
contains the date and time. This suffix is configured with the
<a href="postconf.5.html#maillog_file_rotate_suffix">maillog_file_rotate_suffix</a> parameter (default: %Y%m%d-%H%M%S). </p>

<li> <p> Reload Postfix so that <a href="postlogd.8.html">postlogd(8)</a> immediately closes the
old logfile. </p>

<li> <p> After a brief pause, compress the old logfile. The compression
program is configured with the <a href="postconf.5.html#maillog_file_compressor">maillog_file_compressor</a> parameter
(default: gzip). </p>

</ul>

<p> Notes: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> This command will not rotate a logfile with a pathname under
the /dev directory, such as /dev/stdout. </p>

<li> <p> This command does not (yet) remove old logfiles. </p>

</ul>

<h2> <a name="limitations">Limitations</a> </h2>

<p> Background: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Postfix consists of a number of daemon programs that run
in the background, as well as non-daemon programs for local mail
submission or Postfix management.

<li> <p> Logging to the Postfix logfile or stdout requires the Postfix
<a href="postlogd.8.html">postlogd(8)</a> service. This ensures that simultaneous logging from
different programs will not get mixed up. </p>

<li> <p> All Postfix programs can log to syslog, but not all programs
have sufficient privileges to use the Postfix logging service, and
many non-daemon programs must not log to stdout as that would corrupt
their output. </p>

</ul>

<p> Limitations: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Non-daemon Postfix programs will log errors to syslogd(8)
before they have processed command-line options and <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a> parameters.

<li> <p> If Postfix is down, the non-daemon programs <a href="postfix.1.html">postfix(1)</a>,
<a href="postsuper.1.html">postsuper(1)</a>, <a href="postmulti.1.html">postmulti(1)</a>, and <a href="postlog.1.html">postlog(1)</a>, will log directly to
$<a href="postconf.5.html#maillog_file">maillog_file</a>. These programs expect to run with root privileges,
for example during Postfix start-up, reload, or shutdown.

<li> <p> Other non-daemon Postfix programs will never write directly
to $<a href="postconf.5.html#maillog_file">maillog_file</a> (also, logging to stdout would interfere with the
operation of some of these programs). These programs can log to
<a href="postlogd.8.html">postlogd(8)</a> if they are run by the super-user, or if their executable
file has set-gid permission. Do not set this permission on programs
other than <a href="postdrop.1.html">postdrop(1)</a> and <a href="postqueue.1.html">postqueue(1)</a>.
