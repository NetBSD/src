LOCAL(8)                                                              LOCAL(8)

<b>NAME</b>
       local - Postfix local mail delivery

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>local</b> [generic Postfix daemon options]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  <a href="local.8.html"><b>local</b>(8)</a> daemon processes delivery requests from the Postfix queue
       manager to deliver mail to local  recipients.   Each  delivery  request
       specifies  a  queue file, a sender address, a domain or host to deliver
       to, and one or more recipients.  This program expects to  be  run  from
       the <a href="master.8.html"><b>master</b>(8)</a> process manager.

       The  <a href="local.8.html"><b>local</b>(8)</a>  daemon  updates queue files and marks recipients as fin-
       ished, or it informs the queue manager that delivery  should  be  tried
       again  at  a  later  time.  Delivery  status  reports  are  sent to the
       <a href="bounce.8.html"><b>bounce</b>(8)</a>, <a href="defer.8.html"><b>defer</b>(8)</a> or <a href="trace.8.html"><b>trace</b>(8)</a> daemon as appropriate.

<b>CASE FOLDING</b>
       All delivery decisions are made using the bare recipient name (i.e. the
       address  localpart),  folded  to  lower  case.   See also under ADDRESS
       EXTENSION below for a few exceptions.

<b>SYSTEM-WIDE AND USER-LEVEL ALIASING</b>
       The system administrator can set  up  one  or  more  system-wide  <b>send-</b>
       <b>mail</b>-style  alias  databases.  Users can have <b>sendmail</b>-style ~/.<b>forward</b>
       files.  Mail for <i>name</i> is delivered to the alias <i>name</i>,  to  destinations
       in ~<i>name</i>/.<b>forward</b>, to the mailbox owned by the user <i>name</i>, or it is sent
       back as undeliverable.

       The system administrator can specify a comma/space  separated  list  of
       ~/.<b>forward</b> like files through the <b><a href="postconf.5.html#forward_path">forward_path</a></b> configuration parameter.
       Upon delivery, the local delivery agent tries each pathname in the list
       until a file is found.

       Delivery via ~/.<b>forward</b> files is done with the privileges of the recip-
       ient.  Thus, ~/.<b>forward</b> like files must be readable by  the  recipient,
       and  their  parent directory needs to have "execute" permission for the
       recipient.

       The <b><a href="postconf.5.html#forward_path">forward_path</a></b> parameter is subject to interpolation of <b>$user</b> (recip-
       ient  username),  <b>$home</b>  (recipient  home directory), <b>$shell</b> (recipient
       shell), <b>$recipient</b> (complete recipient address), <b>$extension</b>  (recipient
       address  extension), <b>$domain</b> (recipient domain), <b>$local</b> (entire recipi-
       ent   address   localpart)   and   <b>$<a href="postconf.5.html#recipient_delimiter">recipient_delimiter</a>.</b>   The    forms
       <i>${name?value}</i>  and  <i>${name:value}</i>  expand  conditionally  to <i>value</i> when
       <i>$name</i> is (is not) defined.  Characters that may have special meaning to
       the  shell  or  file  system  are replaced by underscores.  The list of
       acceptable characters is specified  with  the  <b><a href="postconf.5.html#forward_expansion_filter">forward_expansion_filter</a></b>
       configuration parameter.

       An  alias  or ~/.<b>forward</b> file may list any combination of external com-
       mands, destination file names, <b>:include:</b> directives, or mail addresses.
       See  <a href="aliases.5.html"><b>aliases</b>(5)</a>  for a precise description. Each line in a user's .<b>for-</b>
       <b>ward</b> file has the same syntax as the right-hand part of an alias.

       When an address is found in its own alias expansion, delivery  is  made
       to the user instead. When a user is listed in the user's own ~/.<b>forward</b>
       file, delivery is made to the user's mailbox instead.  An empty ~/.<b>for-</b>
       <b>ward</b> file means do not forward mail.

       In  order to prevent the mail system from using up unreasonable amounts
       of memory, input records read from <b>:include:</b> or from  ~/.<b>forward</b>  files
       are broken up into chunks of length <b><a href="postconf.5.html#line_length_limit">line_length_limit</a></b>.

       While  expanding  aliases,  ~/.<b>forward</b>  files,  and  so on, the program
       attempts to avoid duplicate deliveries. The <b><a href="postconf.5.html#duplicate_filter_limit">duplicate_filter_limit</a></b> con-
       figuration parameter limits the number of remembered recipients.

<b>MAIL FORWARDING</b>
       For  the  sake  of reliability, forwarded mail is re-submitted as a new
       message, so that each recipient has a separate on-file delivery  status
       record.

       In  order  to  stop  mail  forwarding loops early, the software adds an
       optional  <b>Delivered-To:</b>  header  with  the  final  envelope   recipient
       address.  If  mail  arrives for a recipient that is already listed in a
       <b>Delivered-To:</b> header, the message is bounced.

<b>MAILBOX DELIVERY</b>
       The default per-user mailbox is a file in the UNIX mail spool directory
       (<b>/var/mail/</b><i>user</i> or <b>/var/spool/mail/</b><i>user</i>); the location can be specified
       with the <b><a href="postconf.5.html#mail_spool_directory">mail_spool_directory</a></b> configuration parameter. Specify  a  name
       ending in <b>/</b> for <b>qmail</b>-compatible <b>maildir</b> delivery.

       Alternatively,  the  per-user  mailbox can be a file in the user's home
       directory with a name  specified  via  the  <b><a href="postconf.5.html#home_mailbox">home_mailbox</a></b>  configuration
       parameter. Specify a relative path name. Specify a name ending in <b>/</b> for
       <b>qmail</b>-compatible <b>maildir</b> delivery.

       Mailbox delivery can be delegated to an external command specified with
       the  <b><a href="postconf.5.html#mailbox_command_maps">mailbox_command_maps</a></b> and <b><a href="postconf.5.html#mailbox_command">mailbox_command</a></b> configuration parameters.
       The command executes with the privileges of the recipient user  (excep-
       tions:  secondary  groups are not enabled; in case of delivery as root,
       the command executes with the privileges of <b><a href="postconf.5.html#default_privs">default_privs</a></b>).

       Mailbox delivery can be delegated  to  alternative  message  transports
       specified  in the <a href="master.5.html"><b>master.cf</b></a> file.  The <b><a href="postconf.5.html#mailbox_transport_maps">mailbox_transport_maps</a></b> and <b><a href="postconf.5.html#mailbox_transport">mail</a>-</b>
       <b><a href="postconf.5.html#mailbox_transport">box_transport</a></b> configuration  parameters  specify  an  optional  message
       transport  that  is  to be used for all local recipients, regardless of
       whether they  are  found  in  the  UNIX  passwd  database.   The  <b><a href="postconf.5.html#fallback_transport_maps">fall</a>-</b>
       <b><a href="postconf.5.html#fallback_transport_maps">back_transport_maps</a></b>   and   <b><a href="postconf.5.html#fallback_transport">fallback_transport</a></b>  parameters  specify  an
       optional message transport for recipients that are  not  found  in  the
       <a href="aliases.5.html">aliases(5)</a> or UNIX passwd database.

       In  the  case  of  UNIX-style  mailbox  delivery,  the  <a href="local.8.html"><b>local</b>(8)</a> daemon
       prepends a "<b>From</b> <i>sender time</i><b>_</b><i>stamp</i>" envelope header  to  each  message,
       prepends  an  <b>X-Original-To:</b> header with the recipient address as given
       to Postfix, prepends an optional <b>Delivered-To:</b> header  with  the  final
       envelope  recipient  address,  prepends  a <b>Return-Path:</b> header with the
       envelope sender address, prepends a &gt; character to lines beginning with
       "<b>From</b>  ",  and appends an empty line.  The mailbox is locked for exclu-
       sive access while delivery is in progress.  In  case  of  problems,  an
       attempt is made to truncate the mailbox to its original length.

       In  the case of <b>maildir</b> delivery, the local daemon prepends an optional
       <b>Delivered-To:</b>  header  with  the  final  envelope  recipient   address,
       prepends  an  <b>X-Original-To:</b> header with the recipient address as given
       to Postfix, and prepends a <b>Return-Path:</b> header with the envelope sender
       address.

<b>EXTERNAL COMMAND DELIVERY</b>
       The  <b><a href="postconf.5.html#allow_mail_to_commands">allow_mail_to_commands</a></b>  configuration parameter restricts delivery
       to external commands. The default setting (<b>alias, forward</b>) forbids com-
       mand destinations in <b>:include:</b> files.

       Optionally, the process working directory is changed to the path speci-
       fied with <b><a href="postconf.5.html#command_execution_directory">command_execution_directory</a></b> (Postfix 2.2 and later).  Failure
       to change directory causes mail to be deferred.

       The  <b><a href="postconf.5.html#command_execution_directory">command_execution_directory</a></b> parameter value is subject to interpo-
       lation of <b>$user</b> (recipient username), <b>$home</b> (recipient home directory),
       <b>$shell</b>  (recipient  shell),  <b>$recipient</b>  (complete  recipient address),
       <b>$extension</b> (recipient address extension), <b>$domain</b>  (recipient  domain),
       <b>$local</b>  (entire  recipient address localpart) and <b>$<a href="postconf.5.html#recipient_delimiter">recipient_delimiter</a>.</b>
       The forms <i>${name?value}</i> and <i>${name:value}</i> expand conditionally to <i>value</i>
       when <i>$name</i> is (is not) defined.  Characters that may have special mean-
       ing to the shell or file system are replaced by underscores.  The  list
       of   acceptable  characters  is  specified  with  the  <b><a href="postconf.5.html#execution_directory_expansion_filter">execution_direc</a>-</b>
       <b><a href="postconf.5.html#execution_directory_expansion_filter">tory_expansion_filter</a></b> configuration parameter.

       The command is executed directly  where  possible.  Assistance  by  the
       shell  (<b>/bin/sh</b> on UNIX systems) is used only when the command contains
       shell magic characters, or when the command invokes  a  shell  built-in
       command.

       A limited amount of command output (standard output and standard error)
       is captured for inclusion with non-delivery status reports.  A  command
       is   forcibly   terminated   if   it  does  not  complete  within  <b>com-</b>
       <b>mand_time_limit</b> seconds.  Command exit status  codes  are  expected  to
       follow  the  conventions  defined in &lt;<b>sysexits.h</b>&gt;.  Exit status 0 means
       normal successful completion.

       Postfix version 2.3 and later support <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3463">RFC  3463</a>-style  enhanced  status
       codes.   If  a  command terminates with a non-zero exit status, and the
       command output begins with an enhanced status code,  this  status  code
       takes precedence over the non-zero exit status.

       A  limited  amount of message context is exported via environment vari-
       ables. Characters that may  have  special  meaning  to  the  shell  are
       replaced  by  underscores.  The list of acceptable characters is speci-
       fied with the <b><a href="postconf.5.html#command_expansion_filter">command_expansion_filter</a></b> configuration parameter.

       <b>SHELL</b>  The recipient user's login shell.

       <b>HOME</b>   The recipient user's home directory.

       <b>USER</b>   The bare recipient name.

       <b>EXTENSION</b>
              The optional recipient address extension.

       <b>DOMAIN</b> The recipient address domain part.

       <b>LOGNAME</b>
              The bare recipient name.

       <b>LOCAL</b>  The entire recipient address localpart (text to the left of  the
              rightmost @ character).

       <b>ORIGINAL_RECIPIENT</b>
              The  entire  recipient  address, before any address rewriting or
              aliasing (Postfix 2.5 and later).

       <b>RECIPIENT</b>
              The entire recipient address.

       <b>SENDER</b> The entire sender address.

       Additional remote client information is made available via the  follow-
       ing environment variables:

       <b>CLIENT_ADDRESS</b>
              Remote client network address. Available as of Postfix 2.2.

       <b>CLIENT_HELO</b>
              Remote  client  EHLO  command parameter. Available as of Postfix
              2.2.

       <b>CLIENT_HOSTNAME</b>
              Remote client hostname. Available as of Postfix 2.2.

       <b>CLIENT_PROTOCOL</b>
              Remote client protocol. Available as of Postfix 2.2.

       <b>SASL_METHOD</b>
              SASL authentication method specified in the remote  client  AUTH
              command. Available as of Postfix 2.2.

       <b>SASL_SENDER</b>
              SASL  sender  address  specified  in the remote client MAIL FROM
              command. Available as of Postfix 2.2.

       <b>SASL_USERNAME</b>
              SASL username specified  in  the  remote  client  AUTH  command.
              Available as of Postfix 2.2.

       The  <b>PATH</b>  environment  variable  is always reset to a system-dependent
       default path, and environment variables whose names are blessed by  the
       <b><a href="postconf.5.html#export_environment">export_environment</a></b> configuration parameter are exported unchanged.

       The current working directory is the mail queue directory.

       The <a href="local.8.html"><b>local</b>(8)</a> daemon prepends a "<b>From</b> <i>sender time</i><b>_</b><i>stamp</i>" envelope header
       to each message, prepends an <b>X-Original-To:</b> header with  the  recipient
       address  as given to Postfix, prepends an optional <b>Delivered-To:</b> header
       with the final recipient  envelope  address,  prepends  a  <b>Return-Path:</b>
       header with the sender envelope address, and appends no empty line.

<b>EXTERNAL FILE DELIVERY</b>
       The  delivery  format  depends on the destination filename syntax.  The
       default is to use UNIX-style mailbox format.  Specify a name ending  in
       <b>/</b> for <b>qmail</b>-compatible <b>maildir</b> delivery.

       The  <b><a href="postconf.5.html#allow_mail_to_files">allow_mail_to_files</a></b>  configuration parameter restricts delivery to
       external files. The default setting (<b>alias, forward</b>) forbids file  des-
       tinations in <b>:include:</b> files.

       In  the  case  of  UNIX-style  mailbox  delivery,  the  <a href="local.8.html"><b>local</b>(8)</a> daemon
       prepends a "<b>From</b> <i>sender time</i><b>_</b><i>stamp</i>" envelope header  to  each  message,
       prepends  an  <b>X-Original-To:</b> header with the recipient address as given
       to Postfix, prepends an optional <b>Delivered-To:</b> header  with  the  final
       recipient  envelope  address, prepends a &gt; character to lines beginning
       with "<b>From</b> ", and appends an empty line.  The envelope  sender  address
       is  available  in  the  <b>Return-Path:</b> header.  When the destination is a
       regular file, it is locked for exclusive access while  delivery  is  in
       progress. In case of problems, an attempt is made to truncate a regular
       file to its original length.

       In the case of <b>maildir</b> delivery, the local daemon prepends an  optional
       <b>Delivered-To:</b>  header  with  the  final envelope recipient address, and
       prepends an <b>X-Original-To:</b> header with the recipient address  as  given
       to   Postfix.    The  envelope  sender  address  is  available  in  the
       <b>Return-Path:</b> header.

<b>ADDRESS EXTENSION</b>
       The optional <b><a href="postconf.5.html#recipient_delimiter">recipient_delimiter</a></b> configuration parameter specifies  how
       to separate address extensions from local recipient names.

       For  example,  with  "<b><a href="postconf.5.html#recipient_delimiter">recipient_delimiter</a>  =  +</b>",  mail for <i>name</i>+<i>foo</i> is
       delivered to the alias <i>name</i>+<i>foo</i> or to the alias <i>name</i>, to  the  destina-
       tions listed in ~<i>name</i>/.<b>forward</b>+<i>foo</i> or in ~<i>name</i>/.<b>forward</b>, to the mailbox
       owned by the user <i>name</i>, or it is sent back as undeliverable.

<b>DELIVERY RIGHTS</b>
       Deliveries to external files and external commands are  made  with  the
       rights  of the receiving user on whose behalf the delivery is made.  In
       the absence of a user context,  the  <a href="local.8.html"><b>local</b>(8)</a>  daemon  uses  the  owner
       rights  of  the <b>:include:</b> file or alias database.  When those files are
       owned by the superuser, delivery is made with the rights specified with
       the <b><a href="postconf.5.html#default_privs">default_privs</a></b> configuration parameter.

<b>STANDARDS</b>
       <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822">RFC 822</a> (ARPA Internet Text Messages)
       <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3463">RFC 3463</a> (Enhanced status codes)

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Problems  and transactions are logged to <b>syslogd</b>(8).  Corrupted message
       files are marked so that the queue manager can move them to the <b>corrupt</b>
       queue afterwards.

       Depending  on the setting of the <b><a href="postconf.5.html#notify_classes">notify_classes</a></b> parameter, the postmas-
       ter is notified of bounces and of other trouble.

<b>SECURITY</b>
       The <a href="local.8.html"><b>local</b>(8)</a> delivery agent needs a dual personality 1) to  access  the
       private Postfix queue and IPC mechanisms, 2) to impersonate the recipi-
       ent and deliver to recipient-specified files or commands. It is  there-
       fore security sensitive.

       The  <a href="local.8.html"><b>local</b>(8)</a>  delivery agent disallows regular expression substitution
       of $1 etc. in <b><a href="postconf.5.html#alias_maps">alias_maps</a></b>, because that would open a security hole.

       The <a href="local.8.html"><b>local</b>(8)</a> delivery agent will silently ignore requests  to  use  the
       <a href="proxymap.8.html"><b>proxymap</b>(8)</a>  server  within  <b><a href="postconf.5.html#alias_maps">alias_maps</a></b>. Instead it will open the table
       directly.  Before Postfix version 2.2, the <a href="local.8.html"><b>local</b>(8)</a> delivery agent will
       terminate with a fatal error.

<b>BUGS</b>
       For  security reasons, the message delivery status of external commands
       or of external files is never checkpointed to file. As  a  result,  the
       program  may occasionally deliver more than once to a command or exter-
       nal file. Better safe than sorry.

       Mutually-recursive aliases or ~/.<b>forward</b> files are not detected  early.
       The  resulting  mail forwarding loop is broken by the use of the <b>Deliv-</b>
       <b>ered-To:</b> message header.

<b>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS</b>
       Changes to <a href="postconf.5.html"><b>main.cf</b></a> are picked up automatically, as  <a href="local.8.html"><b>local</b>(8)</a>  processes
       run for only a limited amount of time. Use the command "<b>postfix reload</b>"
       to speed up a change.
