<hr>

<h2>Purpose of Postfix SMTP access policy delegation</h2>

<p> The Postfix SMTP server has a number of built-in mechanisms to
block or accept mail at specific SMTP protocol stages. In addition,
the Postfix SMTP server can delegate decisions to an external policy
server (Postfix 2.1 and later). </p>

<p> With this policy delegation mechanism, a simple <a href="#greylist">
greylist </a> policy can be implemented with only a dozen lines of
Perl, as is shown at the end of this document. A complete example
can be found in the Postfix source code, in the directory
examples/smtpd-policy. </p>

<p> Another example of policy delegation is the SPF policy server
at <a href="http://www.openspf.org/Software">http://www.openspf.org/Software</a>.  </p>

<p> Policy delegation is now the preferred method for adding policies
to Postfix. It's much easier to develop a new feature in few lines
of Perl, Python, Ruby, or TCL, than trying to do the same in C code.
The difference in
performance will be unnoticeable except in the most demanding
environments. On active systems a policy daemon process is used
multiple times, for up to $<a href="postconf.5.html#max_use">max_use</a> incoming SMTP connections. </p>

<h2><a name="protocol">Protocol description</a></h2>

<p> The Postfix policy delegation protocol is really simple. The
client request is a sequence of name=value attributes separated by
newline, and is terminated by an empty line. The server reply is
one name=value attribute and it, too, is terminated by an empty
line. </p>

<p> Here is an example of all the attributes that the Postfix SMTP
server sends in a delegated SMTPD access policy request: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>Postfix version 2.1 and later:</b>
request=smtpd_access_policy
protocol_state=RCPT

<p> Notes: </p>

<ul>

    <li> <p> The "request" attribute is required. In this example
    the request type is "smtpd_access_policy". </p>

    <li> <p> The order of the attributes does not matter. The policy
    server should ignore any attributes that it does not care about.
    </p>

    <li> <p> When the same attribute name is sent more than once,
    the server may keep the first value or the last attribute value.
    </p>

    <li> <p> When an attribute value is unavailable, the client
    either does not send the attribute, sends the attribute with
    an empty value ("name="), or sends a zero value ("name=0") in
    the case of a numerical attribute. </p>

    <li> <p> The "recipient" attribute is available in the "RCPT
    TO" stage. It is also available in the "DATA" and "END-OF-MESSAGE"
    stages if Postfix accepted only one recipient for the current
    message.  </p>

    <li> <p> The "recipient_count" attribute (Postfix 2.3 and later)
    is non-zero only in the "DATA" and "END-OF-MESSAGE" stages. It
    specifies the number of recipients that Postfix accepted for
    the current message.  </p>

    <li> <p> The client address is an IPv4 dotted quad in the form
    1.2.3.4 or it is an IPv6 address in the form 1:2:3::4:5:6.
    </p>

    <li> <p> For a discussion of the differences between reverse
    and verified client_name information, see the
    <a href="postconf.5.html#reject_unknown_client_hostname">reject_unknown_client_hostname</a> discussion in the <a href="postconf.5.html">postconf(5)</a>
    document.  </p>

    <li> <p> An attribute name must not contain "=", null or newline,
    and an attribute value must not contain null or newline. </p>

    <li> <p> The "instance" attribute value can be used to correlate
    different requests regarding the same message delivery. These
    requests are sent over the same policy connection (unless the
    policy daemon terminates the connection).  Once Postfix sends
    a query with a different instance attribute over that same
    policy connection, the previous message delivery is either
    completed or aborted. </p>

    <li> <p> The "size" attribute value specifies the message size
    that the client specified in the MAIL FROM command (zero if
    none was specified). With Postfix 2.2 and later, it specifies
    the actual message size when the client sends the END-OF-DATA
    command.
    </p>

    <li> <p> The "sasl_*" attributes (Postfix 2.2 and later) specify
    information about how the client was authenticated via SASL.
    These attributes are empty in case of no SASL authentication.
    </p>

    <li> <p> The "ccert_*" attributes (Postfix 2.2 and later) specify
    information about how the client was authenticated via TLS.
    These attributes are empty in case of no certificate authentication.
    As of Postfix 2.2.11 these attribute values are encoded as
    xtext: some characters are represented by +XX, where XX is the
    two-digit hexadecimal representation of the character value. With
    Postfix 2.6 and later, the decoded string is an UTF-8 string
    without non-printable ASCII characters.  </p>

    <li> <p> The "encryption_*" attributes (Postfix 2.3 and later)
    specify information about how the connection is encrypted. With
    plaintext connections the protocol and cipher attributes are
    empty and the keysize is zero.  </p>

    <li> <p> The "etrn_domain" attribute is defined only in the
    context of the ETRN command, and specifies the ETRN command
    parameter. </p>

    <li> <p> The "stress" attribute is either empty or "yes".  See
    the <a href="STRESS_README.html">STRESS_README</a> document for further information. </p>

    <li> <p> The "policy_context" attribute provides a way to pass
    information that is not available via other attributes (Postfix
    version 3.1 and later). </p>

</ul>

<p> The following is specific to SMTPD delegated policy requests:
</p>

<ul>

    <li> <p> Protocol names are ESMTP or SMTP. </p>

    <li> <p> Protocol states are CONNECT, EHLO, HELO, MAIL, RCPT,
    DATA, END-OF-MESSAGE, VRFY or ETRN; these are the SMTP protocol
    states where
    the Postfix SMTP server makes an OK/REJECT/HOLD/etc. decision.
    </p>

</ul>

<p> The policy server replies with any action that is allowed in a
Postfix SMTPD <a href="access.5.html">access(5)</a> table. Example: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
action=<a href="postconf.5.html#defer_if_permit">defer_if_permit</a> Service temporarily unavailable
[empty line]
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> This causes the Postfix SMTP server to reject the request with
a 450 temporary error code and with text "Service temporarily
unavailable", if the Postfix SMTP server finds no reason to reject
the request permanently. </p>

<p> In case of trouble the policy server must not send a reply.
Instead the server must log a warning and disconnect.  Postfix will
retry the request at some later time.  </p>

<h2><a name="client_config">Simple policy client/server configuration</a></h2>

<p> The Postfix delegated policy client can connect to a TCP socket
or to a UNIX-domain socket. Examples: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
inet:127.0.0.1:9998
unix:/some/where/policy
unix:private/policy
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> The first example specifies that the policy server listens on
a TCP socket at 127.0.0.1 port 9998. The second example specifies
an absolute pathname of a UNIX-domain socket. The third example
specifies a pathname relative to the Postfix queue directory; use
this for policy servers that are spawned by the Postfix master
daemon. </p>

<p> To create a policy service that listens on a UNIX-domain socket
called "policy", and that runs under control of the Postfix <a href="spawn.8.html">spawn(8)</a>
daemon, you would use something like this: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
 1 /etc/postfix/<a href="master.5.html">master.cf</a>:
 2     policy  unix  -       n       n       -       0       spawn
 3       user=nobody argv=/some/where/policy-server
 4 
 5 /etc/postfix/<a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>:
 6     <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_recipient_restrictions">smtpd_recipient_restrictions</a> =
 7         ... 
 8         <a href="postconf.5.html#reject_unauth_destination">reject_unauth_destination</a> 
 9         <a href="postconf.5.html#check_policy_service">check_policy_service</a> unix:private/policy 
10         ...
11     <a href="postconf.5.html#transport_time_limit">policy_time_limit</a> = 3600
12     # <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_policy_service_request_limit">smtpd_policy_service_request_limit</a> = 1
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> NOTES: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Lines 2-3: this creates the service called "policy" that
listens on a UNIX-domain socket. The service is implemented by the
Postfix <a href="spawn.8.html">spawn(8)</a> daemon, which executes the policy server program
that is specified with the <b>argv</b> attribute, using the privileges
specified with the <b>user</b> attribute. </p>

<li> <p> Line 2: specify a "0" process limit instead of the default
"-", to avoid "connection refused" and other problems when you
increase the smtpd process limit. </p>

<li> <p> Line 8: <a href="postconf.5.html#reject_unauth_destination">reject_unauth_destination</a> is not needed here if
the mail relay policy is specified with <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_relay_restrictions">smtpd_relay_restrictions</a>
(available with Postfix 2.10 and later). </p>

<li> <p> Lines 8, 9: always specify "<a href="postconf.5.html#check_policy_service">check_policy_service</a>" AFTER
"<a href="postconf.5.html#reject_unauth_destination">reject_unauth_destination</a>" or else your system could become an
open relay. </p>

<li> <p> Line 11: this increases the time that a policy server
process may run to 3600 seconds.  The default time limit of 1000
seconds is too short; the policy daemon needs to run long as the
SMTP server process that talks to it.
See the <a href="spawn.8.html">spawn(8)</a> manpage for more information about the
<a href="postconf.5.html#transport_time_limit"><i>transport</i>_time_limit</a> parameter.  </p>

<blockquote> <p> Note: the "<a href="postconf.5.html#transport_time_limit">policy_time_limit</a>" parameter will not
show up in "postconf" command output before Postfix version 2.9.
This limitation applies to many parameters whose name is a combination
of a <a href="master.5.html">master.cf</a> service name (in the above example, "policy") and a
built-in suffix (in the above example: "_time_limit").  </p>

<li> <p> <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_policy_service_default_action">smtpd_policy_service_default_action</a> (default: 451 4.3.5
Server configuration problem): The default action when an SMTPD
policy service request fails.  Available with Postfix 3.0 and
later. </p>

<li> <p> <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_policy_service_max_idle">smtpd_policy_service_max_idle</a> (default: 300s): The amount

<li> <p> <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_policy_service_request_limit">smtpd_policy_service_request_limit</a> (default: 0): The maximal
number of requests per policy connection, or zero (no limit).
Available with Postfix 3.0 and later. </p>

<li> <p> <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_policy_service_timeout">smtpd_policy_service_timeout</a> (default: 100s): The time
limit to connect to, send to or receive from a policy server. </p>

<li> <p> <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_policy_service_try_limit">smtpd_policy_service_try_limit</a> (default: 2): The maximal
number of attempts to send an SMTPD policy service request before
giving up.  Available with Postfix 3.0 and later.  </p>

<li> <p> <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_policy_service_retry_delay">smtpd_policy_service_retry_delay</a> (default: 1s): The delay
between attempts to resend a failed SMTPD policy service request.
Available with Postfix 3.0 and later.  </p>

<li> <p> <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_policy_service_policy_context">smtpd_policy_service_policy_context</a> (default: empty):
Optional information that is passed in the "policy_context" attribute
of an SMTPD policy service request (originally, to share the same
SMTPD service endpoint among multiple <a href="postconf.5.html#check_policy_service">check_policy_service</a> clients).
Available with Postfix 3.1 and later.  </p>

</ul>

<p> Configuration parameters that control the server side of the
policy delegation protocol: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> <a href="postconf.5.html#transport_time_limit"><i>transport</i>_time_limit</a> ($<a href="postconf.5.html#command_time_limit">command_time_limit</a>): The
maximal amount of time the policy daemon is allowed to run before
it is terminated. The <i>transport</i> is the service name of the
<a href="master.5.html">master.cf</a> entry for the policy daemon service. In the above
examples, the service name is "policy" or "127.0.0.1:9998". </p>

</ul>

<h2><a name="advanced">Advanced policy client configuration</a></h2>

<p> The previous section lists a number of Postfix <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a> parameters
that control time limits and other settings for all policy clients.
This is sufficient for simple configurations. With more complex
configurations it becomes desirable to have different settings per
policy client. This is supported with Postfix 3.0 and later. </p>

<p> The following example shows a "non-critical" policy service
with a short timeout, and with "DUNNO" as default action when the
service is unvailable. The "DUNNO" action causes Postfix to ignore
the result. </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
1 /etc/postfix/<a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>:
2     <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_recipient_restrictions">smtpd_recipient_restrictions</a> =

6             timeout=10s, default_action=DUNNO }
8         ...
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> Instead of a server endpoint, we now have a list enclosed in {}. </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Line 5: The first item in the list is the server endpoint.
This supports the exact same "inet" and "unix" syntax as described
earlier. </p>

<li> <p> Line 6: The remainder of the list contains per-client
settings. These settings override global <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a> parameters,
and have the same name as those parameters, without the
"smtpd_policy_service_" prefix.  </p>

</ul>

<p> Inside the list, syntax is similar to what we already know from
<a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>: items separated by space or comma. There is one difference:
<b>you must enclose a setting in parentheses, as in "{ name = value
}", if you want to have space or comma within a value or around
"="</b>.  This comes in handy when different policy servers require
different default actions with different SMTP status codes or text:
</p>

<h2><a name="greylist">Example: greylist policy server</a></h2>

<p> Greylisting is a defense against junk email that is described at
<a href="http://www.greylisting.org/">http://www.greylisting.org/</a>. The idea was discussed on the
postfix-users mailing list <a
href="http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/postfix/2002-03/0846.html">
one year before it was popularized</a>. </p>

<p> The file examples/smtpd-policy/greylist.pl in the Postfix source
tree implements a simplified greylist policy server. This server
stores a time stamp for every (client, sender, recipient) triple.
By default, mail is not accepted until a time stamp is more than
60 seconds old. This stops junk mail with randomly selected sender
addresses, and mail that is sent through randomly selected open
proxies. It also stops junk mail from spammers that change their
IP address frequently. </p>

<p> Copy examples/smtpd-policy/greylist.pl to /usr/libexec/postfix
or whatever location is appropriate for your system. </p>

<p> In the greylist.pl Perl script you need to specify the
location of the greylist database file, and how long mail will
be delayed before it is accepted. The default settings are:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
$database_name="/var/mta/greylist.db";
$greylist_delay=60;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> The /var/mta directory (or whatever you choose) should be
writable by "nobody", or by whatever username you configure below
in <a href="master.5.html">master.cf</a> for the policy service. </p>

<p> Example: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
# mkdir /var/mta
# chown nobody /var/mta
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> Note: DO NOT create the greylist database in a world-writable
directory such as /tmp or /var/tmp, and DO NOT create the greylist
database in a file system that may run out of space. Postfix can
survive "out of space" conditions with the mail queue and with the
mailbox store, but it cannot survive a corrupted greylist database.
If the file becomes corrupted you may not be able to receive mail
at all until you delete the file by hand. </p>

<p> The greylist.pl Perl script can be run under control by
the Postfix master daemon.  For example, to run the script as user
"nobody", using a UNIX-domain socket that is accessible by Postfix
processes only: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
 1 /etc/postfix/<a href="master.5.html">master.cf</a>:

<h2><a name="all_mail">Greylisting all your mail</a></h2>

<p> If you turn on greylisting for all mail you may want to make
exceptions for mailing lists that use one-time sender addresses,
because each message will be delayed due to greylisting, and the
one-time sender addresses can pollute your greylist database
relatively quickly. Instead of making exceptions, you can automatically
whitelist clients that survive greylisting repeatedly; this avoids
most of the delays and most of the database pollution problem. </p>

<h2><a name="maintenance">Routine greylist maintenance</a></h2>

<p> The greylist database grows over time, because the greylist server
never removes database entries. If left unattended, the greylist
database will eventually run your file system out of space. </p>

<p> When the status file size exceeds some threshold you can simply
rename or remove the file without adverse effects; Postfix
automatically creates a new file. In the worst case, new mail will
be delayed by an hour or so. To lessen the impact, rename or remove
the file in the middle of the night at the beginning of a weekend.
</p>

<h2><a name="greylist_code">Example Perl greylist server</a></h2>

<p> This is the Perl subroutine that implements the example greylist
policy.  It is part of a general purpose sample policy server that
is distributed with the Postfix source as
examples/smtpd-policy/greylist.pl. </p>
