MASTER(5)                                                            MASTER(5)

<b>NAME</b>
       master - Postfix master process configuration file format

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  Postfix mail system is implemented by small number of
       (mostly) client commands that are invoked by users, and by
       a larger number of services that run in the background.

       Postfix  services  are  implemented  by  daemon processes.
       These run in the background under control of the <a href="master.8.html"><b>master</b>(8)</a>
       process.   The  <a href="master.5.html">master.cf</a> configuration file defines how a
       client program connects to a service, and what daemon pro-
       gram  runs  when a service is requested.  Most daemon pro-
       cesses are short-lived  and  terminate  voluntarily  after
       serving  <b><a href="postconf.5.html#max_use">max_use</a></b> clients, or after inactivity for <b><a href="postconf.5.html#max_idle">max_idle</a></b>
       or more units of time.

       All daemons specified here must speak  a  Postfix-internal
       protocol. In order to execute non-Postfix software use the
       <a href="local.8.html"><b>local</b>(8)</a>, <a href="pipe.8.html"><b>pipe</b>(8)</a> or <a href="spawn.8.html"><b>spawn</b>(8)</a> services, or run the  server
       under control by <b>inetd</b>(8) or equivalent.

       After changing <a href="master.5.html">master.cf</a> you must execute "<b>postfix reload</b>"
       to reload the configuration.

<b>SYNTAX</b>
       The general format of the <a href="master.5.html">master.cf</a> file is as follows:

       <b>o</b>      Each logical line defines a single Postfix service.
              Each  service is identified by its name and type as
              described below.  When multiple lines  specify  the
              same  service  name  and type, only the last one is
              remembered.  Otherwise, the order of <a href="master.5.html">master.cf</a> ser-
              vice definitions does not matter.

       <b>o</b>      Empty  lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored,
              as are lines whose first  non-whitespace  character
              is a `#'.

       <b>o</b>      A  logical  line starts with non-whitespace text. A
              line that starts with whitespace continues a  logi-
              cal line.

       Each  logical  line  consists of eight fields separated by
       whitespace.  These are described below  in  the  order  as
       they appear in the <a href="master.5.html">master.cf</a> file.

       Where applicable a field of "-" requests that the built-in
       default value be used. For boolean fields specify  "y"  or
       "n" to override the default value.

       <b>Service name</b>
              The service name syntax depends on the service type
              as described next.

       <b>Service type</b>
              Specify one of the following service types:

              <b>inet</b>   The service listens on a TCP/IP  socket  and
                     is accessible via the network.

                     The  service name is specified as <i>host:port</i>,
                     denoting the host and port on which new con-
                     nections  should  be accepted. The host part
                     (and colon) may be omitted.  Either host  or
                     port  may be given in symbolic form (host or
                     service name) or in numeric form (IP address
                     or  port  number).   Host information may be
                     enclosed inside "[]", but this form  is  not
                     necessary.

                     Examples:  a service named <b>127.0.0.1:smtp</b> or
                     <b>::1:smtp</b>  receives  mail  via  the  loopback
                     interface  only;  and  a service named <b>10025</b>
                     accepts connections on TCP  port  10025  via
                     all    interfaces    configured   with   the
                     <b><a href="postconf.5.html#inet_interfaces">inet_interfaces</a></b> parameter.

                     Note: with Postfix  version  2.2  and  later
                     specify "<b><a href="postconf.5.html#inet_interfaces">inet_interfaces</a> = loopback-only</b>" in
                     <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>, instead of hard-coding loopback  IP
                     address   information  in  <a href="master.5.html">master.cf</a>  or  in
                     <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>.

              <b>unix</b>   The service listens on a UNIX-domain  socket
                     and is accessible for local clients only.

                     The  service  name is a pathname relative to
                     the Postfix queue directory  (pathname  con-
                     trolled  with the <b><a href="postconf.5.html#queue_directory">queue_directory</a></b> configura-
                     tion parameter in <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>).

                     On Solaris systems the <b>unix</b> type  is  imple-
                     mented with streams sockets.

              <b>fifo</b>   The  service  listens on a FIFO (named pipe)
                     and is accessible for local clients only.

                     The service name is a pathname  relative  to
                     the  Postfix  queue directory (pathname con-
                     trolled with the <b><a href="postconf.5.html#queue_directory">queue_directory</a></b>  configura-
                     tion parameter in <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>).

              <b>pass</b>   The service listens on a UNIX-domain socket,
                     and is accessible to local clients only.  It
                     receives  one open connection (file descrip-
                     tor passing) per connection request.

                     The service name is a pathname  relative  to
                     the  Postfix  queue directory (pathname con-
                     trolled with the <b><a href="postconf.5.html#queue_directory">queue_directory</a></b>  configura-
                     tion parameter in <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>).

                     On  Solaris  systems the <b>pass</b> type is imple-
                     mented with streams sockets.

                     This feature is available as of Postfix ver-
                     sion 2.5.

       <b>Private (default: y)</b>
              Whether  or  not  access  is restricted to the mail
              system.  Internet (type  <b>inet</b>)  services  can't  be
              private.

       <b>Unprivileged (default: y)</b>
              Whether the service runs with root privileges or as
              the owner of the Postfix system (the owner name  is
              controlled by the <b><a href="postconf.5.html#mail_owner">mail_owner</a></b> configuration variable
              in the <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a> file).

              The <a href="local.8.html"><b>local</b>(8)</a>,  <a href="pipe.8.html"><b>pipe</b>(8)</a>,  <a href="spawn.8.html"><b>spawn</b>(8)</a>,  and  <a href="virtual.8.html"><b>virtual</b>(8)</a>
              daemons require privileges.

       <b>Chroot (default: y)</b>
              Whether  or  not  the  service runs chrooted to the
              mail queue directory (pathname is controlled by the
              <b><a href="postconf.5.html#queue_directory">queue_directory</a></b>   configuration   variable  in  the
              <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a> file).

              Chroot  should  not  be  used  with  the  <a href="local.8.html"><b>local</b>(8)</a>,
              <a href="pipe.8.html"><b>pipe</b>(8)</a>,    <a href="spawn.8.html"><b>spawn</b>(8)</a>,   and   <a href="virtual.8.html"><b>virtual</b>(8)</a>   daemons.
              Although the <a href="proxymap.8.html"><b>proxymap</b>(8)</a> server can  run  chrooted,
              doing so defeats most of the purpose of having that
              service in the first place.

              The files in the examples/chroot-setup subdirectory
              of the Postfix source archive show set up a Postfix
              chroot environment on a  variety  of  systems.  See
              also  <a href="BASIC_CONFIGURATION_README.html">BASIC_CONFIGURATION_README</a> for issues related
              to running daemons chrooted.

       <b>Wake up time (default: 0)</b>
              Automatically wake up the named service  after  the
              specified  number of seconds. The wake up is imple-
              mented by connecting to the service and  sending  a
              wake  up  request.   A  ? at the end of the wake-up
              time field requests that no wake up events be  sent
              before the first time a service is used.  Specify 0
              for no automatic wake up.

              The <a href="pickup.8.html"><b>pickup</b>(8)</a>, <a href="qmgr.8.html"><b>qmgr</b>(8)</a> and <a href="flush.8.html"><b>flush</b>(8)</a> daemons require
              a wake up timer.

       <b>Process limit (default: $<a href="postconf.5.html#default_process_limit">default_process_limit</a>)</b>
              The  maximum  number  of processes that may execute
              this  service  simultaneously.  Specify  0  for  no
              process count limit.

              NOTE: Some Postfix services must be configured as a
              single-process service (for example,  <a href="qmgr.8.html"><b>qmgr</b>(8)</a>)  and
              some  services  must  be configured with no process
              limit (for example, <a href="cleanup.8.html"><b>cleanup</b>(8)</a>).  These limits must
              not be changed.

       <b>Command name + arguments</b>
              The  command  to  be executed.  Characters that are
              special to the shell such as "&gt;"  or  "|"  have  no
              special  meaning here, and quotes cannot be used to
              protect arguments containing whitespace.

              The command name is relative to the Postfix  daemon
              directory  (pathname  is  controlled  by  the  <b><a href="postconf.5.html#daemon_directory">dae</a>-</b>
              <b><a href="postconf.5.html#daemon_directory">mon_directory</a></b> configuration variable).

              The command argument syntax for  specific  commands
              is  specified in the respective daemon manual page.

              The following command-line options  have  the  same
              effect for all daemon programs:

              <b>-D</b>     Run  the daemon under control by the command
                     specified with the <b><a href="postconf.5.html#debugger_command">debugger_command</a></b> variable
                     in  the  <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>  configuration  file.   See
                     <a href="DEBUG_README.html">DEBUG_README</a> for hints and tips.

              <b>-o</b> <i>name</i>=<i>value</i>
                     Override  the  named  <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>  configuration
                     parameter.  The parameter value can refer to
                     other parameters as <i>$name</i> etc., just like in
                     <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>.  See <a href="postconf.5.html"><b>postconf</b>(5)</a> for syntax.

                     NOTE 1: do not specify whitespace around the
                     "=".  In  parameter  values,  either   avoid
                     whitespace altogether, use commas instead of
                     spaces,  or  consider  overrides  like   "-o
                     name=$override_parameter"     with    $over-
                     ride_parameter set in <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>.

                     NOTE 2: Over-zealous use of parameter  over-
                     rides  makes  the Postfix configuration hard
                     to understand and maintain.   At  a  certain
                     point,  it might be easier to configure mul-
                     tiple instances of Postfix, instead of  con-
                     figuring  multiple  personalities  via  mas-
                     ter.cf.

              <b>-v</b>     Increase the verbose logging level.  Specify
                     multiple <b>-v</b> options to make a Postfix daemon
                     process increasingly verbose.
