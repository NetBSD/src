<h2> <a name="intro">Introduction</a> </h2>

<p> This document describes features that are available in Postfix
3.6 and later. See <a href="POSTSCREEN_3_5_README.html">
POSTSCREEN_3_5_README.html</a> for Postfix versions 2.8 - 3.5. </p>

<p> The Postfix <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> daemon provides additional protection
against mail server overload. One <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> process handles
multiple inbound SMTP connections, and decides which clients may
talk to a Postfix SMTP server process.  By keeping spambots away,
<a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> leaves more SMTP server processes available for
legitimate clients, and delays the onset of <a
href="STRESS_README.html">server overload</a> conditions. </p>

<p> <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> should not be used on SMTP ports that receive
mail from end-user clients (MUAs). In a typical deployment,
<a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> handles the MX service on TCP port 25, while MUA
clients submit mail via the submission service on TCP port 587 which
requires client authentication. Alternatively, a site could set up
a dedicated, non-postscreen, "port 25" server that provides submission
service and client authentication, but no MX service.  </p>

<p> <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> maintains a temporary allowlist for clients that
pass its tests; by allowing allowlisted clients to skip tests,
<a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> minimizes its impact on legitimate email traffic.
</p>

<p> <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> is part of a multi-layer defense. <p>

<ul>

<li> <p> As the first layer, <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> blocks connections from
zombies and other spambots that are responsible for about 90% of
all spam.  It is implemented as a single process to make this defense
as inexpensive as possible. </p>

<li> <p> The second layer implements more complex SMTP-level access
checks with <a href="SMTPD_ACCESS_README.html">Postfix SMTP servers</a>, 
<a href="SMTPD_POLICY_README.html">policy daemons</a>, and 
<a href="MILTER_README.html">Milter applications</a>. </p>

<li> <p> The third layer performs light-weight content inspection
with the Postfix built-in <a href="postconf.5.html#header_checks">header_checks</a> and <a href="postconf.5.html#body_checks">body_checks</a>. This can
block unacceptable attachments such as executable programs, and
worms or viruses with easy-to-recognize signatures. </p>

<li> <p> The fourth layer provides heavy-weight content inspection
with external content filters. Typical examples are <a
href="http://www.ijs.si/software/amavisd/">Amavisd-new</a>, <a
href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/">SpamAssassin</a>, and <a
href="MILTER_README.html">Milter applications</a>. </p>

</ul>

<p> Each layer reduces the spam volume. The general strategy is to
use the less expensive defenses first, and to use the more expensive
defenses only for the spam that remains. </p>

<h2> <a name="basic">The basic idea behind postscreen(8)</a> </h2>

<p> Most email is spam, and most spam is sent out by zombies (malware
on compromised end-user computers).  Wietse expects that the zombie
problem will get worse before things improve, if ever. Without a
tool like <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> that keeps the zombies away, Postfix would be
spending most of its resources not receiving email. </p>

<p> The main challenge for <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> is to make an is-a-zombie
decision based on a single measurement. This is necessary because
many zombies try to fly under the radar and avoid spamming the same
site repeatedly.  Once <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> decides that a client is
not-a-zombie, it allowlists the client temporarily to avoid further
delays for legitimate mail. </p>

<p> Zombies have challenges too: they have only a limited amount
of time to deliver spam before their IP address becomes denylisted.
To speed up spam deliveries, zombies make compromises in their SMTP
protocol implementation.  For example, they speak before their turn,
or they ignore responses from SMTP servers and continue sending
mail even when the server tells them to go away. </p>

<p> <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> uses a variety of measurements to recognize
zombies.  First, <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> determines if the remote SMTP client
IP address is denylisted.  Second, <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> looks for protocol
compromises that are made to speed up delivery.  These are good
indicators for making is-a-zombie decisions based on single
measurements.  </p>

<p> <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> does not inspect message content. Message content
can vary from one delivery to the next, especially with clients
that (also) send legitimate email.  Content is not a good indicator
for making is-a-zombie decisions based on single measurements,
and that is the problem that <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> is focused on.  </p>

<h2> <a name="general"> General operation </a> </h2>

<p> For each connection from an SMTP client, <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> performs
a number of tests
in the order as described below.  Some tests introduce a delay of
a few seconds.  <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> maintains a temporary allowlist for
clients that pass its tests; by allowing allowlisted clients to
skip tests, <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> minimizes its impact on legitimate email
traffic.  </p>

<p> By default, <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> hands off all connections to a Postfix
SMTP server process after logging its findings. This mode is useful
for non-destructive testing. </p>

<p> In a typical production setting, <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> is configured
to reject mail from clients that fail one or more tests, after
logging the helo, sender and recipient information. </p>

<p> Note: <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> is not an SMTP proxy; this is intentional.
The purpose is to keep zombies away from Postfix, with minimal
overhead for legitimate clients. </p>

<h2> <a name="quick">Quick tests before everything else</a> </h2>

<p> Before engaging in SMTP-level tests. <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> queries a
number of local deny and allowlists. These tests speed up the
handling of known clients. </p>

<ul>

<li> <a href="#perm_allow_deny"> Permanent allow/denylist test </a>

<li> <a href="#temp_allow"> Temporary allowlist test </a>

<li> <a href="#allow_veto"> MX Policy test </a>

</ul>

<h3> <a name="perm_allow_deny"> Permanent allow/denylist test </a> </h3>

<p> The <a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_access_list">postscreen_access_list</a> parameter (default: <a href="postconf.5.html#permit_mynetworks">permit_mynetworks</a>)
specifies a permanent access list for SMTP client IP addresses. Typically
one would specify something that allowlists local networks, followed
by a CIDR table for selective allow- and denylisting. </p>

<p> Example: </p>

<pre>
/etc/postfix/<a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>:
    <a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_access_list">postscreen_access_list</a> = <a href="postconf.5.html#permit_mynetworks">permit_mynetworks</a>,
        <a href="cidr_table.5.html">cidr</a>:/etc/postfix/postscreen_access.cidr

/etc/postfix/postscreen_access.<a href="cidr_table.5.html">cidr</a>:
   # Rules are evaluated in the order as specified.
   # Denylist 192.168.* except 192.168.0.1.
   192.168.0.1          permit
   192.168.0.0/16       reject
</pre>

<p> See the <a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_access_list">postscreen_access_list</a> manpage documentation for more
details.  </p>

<p> When the SMTP client address matches a "permit" action,
<a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> logs this with the client address and port number as:
</p>

<blockquote> 
<pre>
<b>ALLOWLISTED</b> <i>[address]:port</i>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<blockquote> <p> Use the <a href="postconf.5.html#respectful_logging">respectful_logging</a> configuration parameter to
select a deprecated form of this logging. </p> </blockquote>

<p> The allowlist action is not configurable: immediately hand off the
connection to a Postfix SMTP server process. </p>

<p> When the SMTP client address matches a "reject" action,
<a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> logs this with the client address and port number as:
</p>

<blockquote> 
<pre>
<b>DENYLISTED</b> <i>[address]:port</i>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<blockquote> <p> Use the <a href="postconf.5.html#respectful_logging">respectful_logging</a> configuration parameter to
select a deprecated form of this logging. </p> </blockquote>

<p> The <a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_denylist_action">postscreen_denylist_action</a> parameter specifies the action
that is taken next.  See "<a href="#fail_before_220">When tests
fail before the 220 SMTP server greeting</a>" below. </p>

<h3> <a name="temp_allow"> Temporary allowlist test </a> </h3>

<p> The <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> daemon maintains a <i>temporary</i>
allowlist for SMTP client IP addresses that have passed all
the tests described below. The <a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_cache_map">postscreen_cache_map</a> parameter
specifies the location of the temporary allowlist.  The
temporary allowlist is not used for SMTP client addresses
that appear on the <i>permanent</i> access list. </p>

<p> By default the temporary allowlist is not shared with other
<a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> daemons. See
<a href="#temp_allow_sharing"> Sharing
the temporary allowlist </a> below for alternatives. </p>

<p> When the SMTP client address appears on the temporary
allowlist, <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> logs this with the client address and port
number as: </p>

<pre>
    <b>PASS OLD</b> <i>[address]:port</i>
</pre>

<p> The action is not configurable: immediately hand off the
connection to a Postfix SMTP server process.  The client is
excluded from further tests until its temporary allowlist
entry expires, as controlled with the postscreen_*_ttl
parameters.  Expired entries are silently renewed if possible. </p>

<h3> <a name="allow_veto"> MX Policy test </a> </h3>

<p> When the remote SMTP client is not on the static access list
or temporary allowlist, <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> can implement a number of
allowlist tests, before it grants the client a temporary allowlist
status that allows it to talk to a Postfix SMTP server process. </p>

<p> When <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> is configured to monitor all primary and
backup MX addresses, it can refuse to allowlist clients that connect
to a backup MX address only (an old spammer trick to take advantage
of backup MX hosts with weaker anti-spam policies than primary MX
hosts). </p>

<blockquote> <p> NOTE: The following solution is for small sites.
Larger sites would have to share the <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> cache between
primary and backup MTAs, which would introduce a common point of
failure.  </p> </blockquote>

<ul>

<li> <p> First, configure the host to listen on both primary and
backup MX addresses. Use the appropriate <tt>ifconfig</tt> or <tt>ip</tt>
command for the local operating system, or update the appropriate
configuration files and "refresh" the network protocol stack. </p>

<p> <p> Second, configure Postfix to listen on the new IP address
(this step is needed when you have specified <a href="postconf.5.html#inet_interfaces">inet_interfaces</a> in
<a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>). </p>

<li> <p> Then, configure <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> to deny the temporary allowlist
status on the backup MX address(es).  An example for Wietse's
server is: </p>

<pre>
/etc/postfix/<a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>:
    <a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_allowlist_interfaces">postscreen_allowlist_interfaces</a> = !168.100.189.8 <a href="DATABASE_README.html#types">static</a>:all
</pre>

<p> Translation: allow clients to obtain the temporary allowlist
status on all server IP addresses except 168.100.189.8, which is a
backup MX address.  </p>

</ul>

<p> When a non-allowlisted client connects the backup MX address,
<a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> logs this with the client address and port number as:
</p>

<blockquote> <pre>
<b>CONNECT from</b> <i>[address]:port</i> <b>to [168.100.189.8]:25</b>
<b>ALLOWLIST VETO</b> <i>[address]:port</i>
</pre> </blockquote>

<blockquote> <p> Use the <a href="postconf.5.html#respectful_logging">respectful_logging</a> configuration parameter to
select a deprecated form of this logging. </p> </blockquote>

<p> Translation: the client at <i>[address]:port</i> connected to
the backup MX address 168.100.189.8 while it was not allowlisted.
The client will not be granted the temporary allowlist status, even
if passes all the allowlist tests described below. </p>

<h2> <a name="before_220"> Tests before the 220 SMTP server greeting </a> </h2>

<p> The <a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_greet_wait">postscreen_greet_wait</a> parameter specifies a short time
interval before the "220 <i>text</i>..." server greeting, where
<a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> can run a number of tests in parallel. </p>

<p> When a good client passes these tests, and no "<a
href="#after_220">deep protocol tests</a>"
are configured, <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a>
adds the client to the temporary allowlist and hands off the "live"
connection to a Postfix SMTP server process.  The client can then
continue as if <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> never even existed (except of course
for the short <a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_greet_wait">postscreen_greet_wait</a> delay).  </p>

<ul>

<li> <a href="#pregreet"> Pregreet test </a>

<li> <a href="#dnsbl"> DNS Allow/denylist test </a>

<li> <a href="#fail_before_220">When tests fail before the 220 SMTP server greeting</a>

</ul>

<h3> <a name="pregreet"> Pregreet test </a> </h3>

<p> The SMTP protocol is a classic example of a protocol where the
server speaks before the client. <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> detects zombies
that are in a hurry and that speak before their turn. This test is
enabled by default. </p>

<p> The <a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_greet_banner">postscreen_greet_banner</a> parameter specifies the <i>text</i>
portion of a "220-<i>text</i>..." teaser banner (default: $<a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_banner">smtpd_banner</a>).
Note that this becomes the first part of a multi-line server greeting.
The <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> daemon sends this before the <a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_greet_wait">postscreen_greet_wait</a>
timer is started.  The purpose of the teaser banner is to confuse
zombies so that they speak before their turn. It has no effect on
SMTP clients that correctly implement the protocol.  </p>

<p> To avoid problems with poorly-implemented SMTP engines in network
appliances or network testing tools, either exclude them from all
tests with the <a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_access_list">postscreen_access_list</a> feature or else specify
an empty teaser banner: </p>

<pre>
/etc/postfix/<a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>:
    # Exclude broken clients by allowlisting. Clients in <a href="postconf.5.html#mynetworks">mynetworks</a>
    # should always be allowlisted.
    <a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_access_list">postscreen_access_list</a> = <a href="postconf.5.html#permit_mynetworks">permit_mynetworks</a>,

<pre>
/etc/postfix/<a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>:
    # Disable the teaser banner (try allowlisting first if you can).
    <a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_greet_banner">postscreen_greet_banner</a> =
</pre>

<p> When an SMTP client sends a command before the
<a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_greet_wait">postscreen_greet_wait</a> time has elapsed, <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> logs this as:
</p>

<pre>
    <b>PREGREET</b> <i>count</i> <b>after</b> <i>time</i> <b>from</b> <i>[address]:port text...</i>
</pre>

<p> Translation: the client at <i>[address]:port</i> sent <i>count</i>
bytes before its turn to speak. This happened <i>time</i> seconds
after the <a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_greet_wait">postscreen_greet_wait</a> timer was started.  The <i>text</i>
is what the client sent (truncated to 100 bytes, and with non-printable
characters replaced with C-style escapes such as \r for carriage-return
and \n for newline). </p>

<p> The <a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_greet_action">postscreen_greet_action</a> parameter specifies the action that
is taken next.  See "<a href="#fail_before_220">When tests fail
before the 220 SMTP server greeting</a>" below. </p>

<h3> <a name="dnsbl"> DNS Allow/denylist test </a> </h3>

<p> The <a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_dnsbl_sites">postscreen_dnsbl_sites</a> parameter (default: empty) specifies
a list of DNS blocklist servers with optional filters and weight
factors (positive weights for denylisting, negative for allowlisting).
These servers will be queried in parallel with the reverse client
IP address.  This test is disabled by default. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>
CAUTION: when postscreen rejects mail, its SMTP reply contains the
DNSBL domain name. Use the <a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_dnsbl_reply_map">postscreen_dnsbl_reply_map</a> feature to
hide "password" information in DNSBL domain names.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p> When the <a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_greet_wait">postscreen_greet_wait</a> time has elapsed, and the combined
DNSBL score is equal to or greater than the <a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_dnsbl_threshold">postscreen_dnsbl_threshold</a>
parameter value, <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> logs this as: </p>

<pre>
    <b>DNSBL rank</b> <i>count</i> <b>for</b> <i>[address]:port</i>

<p> Translation: the SMTP client at <i>[address]:port</i> has a combined
DNSBL score of <i>count</i>. </p>

<p> The <a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_dnsbl_action">postscreen_dnsbl_action</a> parameter specifies the action that
is taken when the combined DNSBL score is equal to or greater than

<h3> <a name="fail_before_220">When tests fail before the 220 SMTP server greeting</a> </h3>

<p> When the client address matches the permanent denylist, or

<h2> <a name="after_220">Tests after the 220 SMTP server greeting</a> </h2>

<p> In this phase of the protocol, <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> implements a
number of "deep protocol" tests. These tests use an SMTP protocol
engine that is built into the <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> server. </p>

<p> Important note: these protocol tests are disabled by default.
They are more intrusive than the pregreet and DNSBL tests, and they
have limitations as discussed next. </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> The main limitation of "after 220 greeting" tests is that
a new client must disconnect after passing these tests (reason:
postscreen is not a proxy).  Then the client must reconnect from
the same IP address before it can deliver mail.  The following
measures may help to avoid email delays: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Allow "good" clients to skip tests with the
<a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_dnsbl_allowlist_threshold">postscreen_dnsbl_allowlist_threshold</a> feature. This is especially effective
for large providers that usually don't retry from the same IP
address. </p>

<li> <p> Small sites: Configure <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> to listen on multiple
IP addresses, published in DNS as different IP addresses for the
same MX hostname or for different MX hostnames. This avoids mail
delivery delays with clients that reconnect immediately from the
same IP address.  </p>

<li> <p> Large sites: Share the <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> cache between different
Postfix MTAs with a large-enough <a href="memcache_table.5.html">memcache_table(5)</a>. Again, this
avoids mail delivery delays with clients that reconnect immediately
from the same IP address. </p>

</ul>

<li> <p> <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a>'s built-in SMTP engine does not implement the
AUTH, XCLIENT, and XFORWARD features. If you need to make these
services available on port 25, then do not enable the tests after
the 220 server greeting. </p>

<li> <p> End-user clients should connect directly to the submission
service, so that they never have to deal with <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a>'s tests.
</p>

</ul>

<p> The following "after 220 greeting" tests are available: </p>

<ul>

<li> <a href="#pipelining">Command pipelining test</a>

<li> <a href="#non_smtp">Non-SMTP command test</a>

<li> <a href="#barelf">Bare newline test</a>

<li> <a href="#fail_after_220">When tests fail after the 220 SMTP server greeting</a>

</ul>

<h3> <a name="pipelining">Command pipelining test</a> </h3>

<p> By default, SMTP is a half-duplex protocol: the sender and
receiver send one command and one response at a time.  Unlike the
Postfix SMTP server, <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> does not announce support
for ESMTP command pipelining.  Therefore, clients are not allowed
to send multiple commands. <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a>'s
<a href="#after_220">deep
protocol test</a> for this is disabled by default. </p>

<p> With "<a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_pipelining_enable">postscreen_pipelining_enable</a> = yes", <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> detects
zombies that send multiple commands, instead of sending one command
and waiting for the server to reply.  </p>

<p> This test is opportunistically enabled when <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> has
to use the built-in SMTP engine anyway. This is to make <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a>
logging more informative. </p>

<p> When a client sends multiple commands, <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> logs this
as: </p>

<pre>
    <b>COMMAND PIPELINING from</b> <i>[address]:port</i> <b>after</b> <i>command</i>: <i>text</i>
</pre>

<p> Translation: the SMTP client at <i>[address]:port</i> sent
multiple SMTP commands, instead of sending one command and then
waiting for the server to reply. This happened after the client
sent <i>command</i>. The <i>text</i> shows part of the input that
was sent too early; it is not logged with Postfix 2.8. </p>

<p> The <a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_pipelining_action">postscreen_pipelining_action</a> parameter specifies the action
that is taken next.  See "<a href="#fail_after_220">When tests fail
after the 220 SMTP server greeting</a>" below. </p>

<h3> <a name="non_smtp">Non-SMTP command test</a> </h3>

<p> Some spambots send their mail through open proxies. A symptom
of this is the usage of commands such as CONNECT and other non-SMTP
commands. Just like the Postfix SMTP server's <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_forbidden_commands">smtpd_forbidden_commands</a>
feature, <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> has an equivalent <a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_forbidden_commands">postscreen_forbidden_commands</a>
feature to block these clients. <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a>'s

<pre>
    <b>PASS NEW</b> <i>[address]:port</i>
</pre>

<p> Where <i>[address]:port</i> are the client IP address and port.
Then, <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a>
creates a temporary allowlist entry that excludes the client IP
address from further tests until the temporary allowlist entry
expires, as controlled with the postscreen_*_ttl parameters. </p>

<p> When no "<a href="#after_220">deep protocol tests</a>" are
configured, <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> hands off the "live" connection to a Postfix
SMTP server process.  The client can then continue as if <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a>
never even existed (except for the short <a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_greet_wait">postscreen_greet_wait</a> delay).
</p>

<p> When any "<a href="#after_220">deep protocol tests</a>" are

disconnect.  The next time the client connects it will be allowed
to talk to a Postfix SMTP server process to deliver its mail.

    dnsblog   unix  -       -       n       -       0       dnsblog
</pre>

<li> <p> To enable DNSBL lookups, list some DNS blocklist sites in
<a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>, separated by whitespace. Different sites can have different
weights. For example:

<pre>
/etc/postfix/<a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>:
    <a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_dnsbl_threshold">postscreen_dnsbl_threshold</a> = 2

        bl.spamcop.net*1 b.barracudacentral.org*1
</pre>

<p> Note: if your DNSBL queries have a "secret" in the domain name,
you must censor this information from the <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> SMTP replies.
For example: </p>

<pre>
/etc/postfix/<a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>:
    <a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_dnsbl_reply_map">postscreen_dnsbl_reply_map</a> = <a href="DATABASE_README.html#types">texthash</a>:/etc/postfix/dnsbl_reply

    secret.zen.dq.spamhaus.net    zen.spamhaus.org
</pre>

<p> The <a href="DATABASE_README.html#types">texthash</a>: format is similar to <a href="DATABASE_README.html#types">hash</a>: except that there is
no need to run <a href="postmap.1.html">postmap(1)</a> before the file can be used, and that it
does not detect changes after the file is read. It is new with
Postfix version 2.8. </p>

<li> <p> Read the new configuration with "<tt>postfix reload</tt>".
</p>

</ol>

<p> Notes: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Some <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> configuration parameters implement
stress-dependent behavior. This is supported only when the default
value is stress-dependent (that is, "postconf -d <i>parametername</i>"
output shows
"<i>parametername</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;${stress?<i>something</i>}${stress:<i>something</i>}" or
"<i>parametername</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;${stress?{<i>something</i>}:{<i>something</i>}}").
Other parameters always evaluate as if the stress value is the empty
string. </p>

<li> <p> See "<a href="#before_220">Tests before the 220 SMTP server
greeting</a>" for details about the logging from these
<a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> tests. </p>

<li> <p> If you run Postfix 2.6 or earlier you must stop and start
the master daemon ("<tt>postfix stop; postfix start</tt>").  This
is needed because the Postfix "pass" master service type did not
work reliably on all systems. </p>

</ul>

<h3> <a name="starttls"> postscreen(8) TLS configuration </a> </h3>

<p> <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> TLS support is available for remote SMTP clients
that aren't allowlisted, including clients that need to renew their
temporary allowlist status.  When a remote SMTP client requests TLS
service, <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> invisibly hands off the connection to a
<a href="tlsproxy.8.html">tlsproxy(8)</a> process. Then, <a href="tlsproxy.8.html">tlsproxy(8)</a> encrypts and decrypts the
traffic between <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> and the remote SMTP client. One
<a href="tlsproxy.8.html">tlsproxy(8)</a> process can handle multiple SMTP sessions. The number
of <a href="tlsproxy.8.html">tlsproxy(8)</a> processes slowly increases with server load, but it
should always be much smaller than the number of <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> TLS
sessions.  </p>

<p> TLS support for <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> and <a href="tlsproxy.8.html">tlsproxy(8)</a> uses the same
parameters as with <a href="smtpd.8.html">smtpd(8)</a>. We recommend that you keep the relevant
configuration parameters in <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>.  If you must specify "-o
smtpd_mumble=value" parameter overrides in <a href="master.5.html">master.cf</a> for a
postscreen-protected <a href="smtpd.8.html">smtpd(8)</a> service, then you should specify those
same parameter overrides for the <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> and <a href="tlsproxy.8.html">tlsproxy(8)</a>
services. </p>

<h3> <a name="blocking"> Blocking mail with postscreen(8) </a> </h3>

<p> For compatibility with <a href="smtpd.8.html">smtpd(8)</a>, <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> implements the
<a href="postconf.5.html#soft_bounce">soft_bounce</a> safety feature. This causes Postfix to reject mail with
a "try again" reply code. </p>

<ul> 

<li> <p> To turn this on for all of Postfix, specify "<tt><a href="postconf.5.html#soft_bounce">soft_bounce</a>
= yes</tt>" in <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>. </p>

<li> <p> To turn this on for <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> only, append "<tt>-o
<a href="postconf.5.html#soft_bounce">soft_bounce</a>=yes</tt>" (note: NO SPACES around '=') to the postscreen
entry in <a href="master.5.html">master.cf</a>. <p>

</ul>

<p> Execute "<tt>postfix reload</tt>" to make the change effective. </p>

<p> After testing, do not forget to remove the <a href="postconf.5.html#soft_bounce">soft_bounce</a> feature,
otherwise senders won't receive their non-delivery notification
until many days later.  </p>

<p> To use the <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> service to block mail, edit <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a> and
specify one or more of: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> "<tt><a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_dnsbl_action">postscreen_dnsbl_action</a> = enforce</tt>", to reject
clients that are on DNS blocklists, and to log the helo/sender/recipient
information. With good DNSBLs this reduces the amount of load on
Postfix SMTP servers dramatically.  </p>

<li> <p> "<tt><a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_greet_action">postscreen_greet_action</a> = enforce</tt>", to reject
clients that talk before their turn, and to log the helo/sender/recipient
information. This stops over half of all known-to-be illegitimate
connections to Wietse's mail server. It is backup protection for
zombies that haven't yet been denylisted. </p>

<li> <p> You can also enable "<a href="#after_220">deep protocol
tests</a>", but these are more intrusive than the pregreet or DNSBL
tests. </p>

<p> When a good client passes the "<a href="#after_220">deep
protocol tests</a>",
<a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> adds the client to the temporary
allowlist but it cannot hand off the "live" connection to a Postfix
SMTP server process in the middle of the session. Instead, <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a>
defers mail delivery attempts with a 4XX status, logs the
helo/sender/recipient information, and waits for the client to
disconnect. </p>

<p> When the good client comes back in a later session, it is allowed
to talk directly to a Postfix SMTP server.  See "<a href="#after_220">Tests
after the 220 SMTP server greeting</a>" above for limitations with
AUTH and other features that clients may need.  </p>

<p> An unexpected benefit from "<a href="#after_220">deep protocol
tests</a>" is that some "good" clients don't return after the 4XX
reply; these clients were not so good after all. </p>

<p> Unfortunately, some senders will retry requests from different
IP addresses, and may never get allowlisted.  For this reason,
Wietse stopped using "<a href="#after_220">deep protocol tests</a>"
on his own internet-facing mail server.  </p>

<li> <p> There is also support for permanent denylisting and
allowlisting; see the description of the <a href="postconf.5.html#postscreen_access_list">postscreen_access_list</a>
parameter for details. </p>

</ul>

<h2> <a name="historical"> Historical notes and credits </a> </h2>

<p> Many ideas in <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> were explored in earlier work by
Michael Tokarev, in OpenBSD spamd, and in MailChannels Traffic
Control. </p>

<p> Wietse threw together a crude prototype with pregreet and dnsbl
support in June 2009, because he needed something new for a Mailserver
conference presentation in July. Ralf Hildebrandt ran this code on
several servers to collect real-world statistics. This version used
the <a href="dnsblog.8.html">dnsblog(8)</a> ad-hoc DNS client program. </p>

<p> Wietse needed new material for a LISA conference presentation
in November 2010, so he added support for DNSBL weights and filters
in August, followed by a major code rewrite, deep protocol tests,
helo/sender/recipient logging, and stress-adaptive behavior in
September. Ralf Hildebrandt ran this code on several servers to
collect real-world statistics. This version still used the embarrassing
<a href="dnsblog.8.html">dnsblog(8)</a> ad-hoc DNS client program.  </p>

<p> Wietse added STARTTLS support in December 2010. This makes
<a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> usable for sites that require TLS support.  The
implementation introduces the <a href="tlsproxy.8.html">tlsproxy(8)</a> event-driven TLS proxy
that decrypts/encrypts the sessions for multiple SMTP clients. </p>

<p> The <a href="tlsproxy.8.html">tlsproxy(8)</a> implementation led to the discovery of a "new"
class of vulnerability (<a
href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0411"
>CVE-2011-0411</a>) that affected multiple implementations of SMTP,
POP, IMAP, NNTP, and FTP over TLS. </p>

<p> <a href="postscreen.8.html">postscreen(8)</a> was officially released as part of the Postfix
2.8 stable release in January 2011.</p>

<p> Noel Jones helped with the Postfix 3.6 transition towards respectful
documentation. </p>
