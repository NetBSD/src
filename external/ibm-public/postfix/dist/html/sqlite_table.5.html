SQLITE_TABLE(5)                                                SQLITE_TABLE(5)

<b>NAME</b>
       sqlite_table - Postfix SQLite configuration

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>postmap -q "</b><i>string</i><b>" <a href="sqlite_table.5.html">sqlite</a>:/etc/postfix/</b><i>filename</i>

       <b>postmap -q - <a href="sqlite_table.5.html">sqlite</a>:/etc/postfix/</b><i>filename</i> &lt;<i>inputfile</i>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  Postfix  mail system uses optional tables for address rewriting or
       mail routing. These tables are usually in <b>dbm</b> or <b>db</b> format.

       Alternatively, lookup tables can be specified as SQLite databases.   In
       order  to use SQLite lookups, define an SQLite source as a lookup table
       in <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>, for example:
           <a href="postconf.5.html#alias_maps">alias_maps</a> = <a href="sqlite_table.5.html">sqlite</a>:/etc/sqlite-aliases.cf

       The file /etc/postfix/sqlite-aliases.cf has  the  same  format  as  the
       Postfix <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a> file, and can specify the parameters described below.

<b>BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY</b>
       For  compatibility  with other Postfix lookup tables, SQLite parameters
       can also be defined in <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>.  In order to do that, specify as SQLite
       source  a  name  that  doesn't begin with a slash or a dot.  The SQLite
       parameters will then be accessible as the name you've given the  source
       in  its  definition, an underscore, and the name of the parameter.  For
       example, if the map is specified as "<a href="sqlite_table.5.html">sqlite</a>:<i>sqlitename</i>", the  parameter
       "query" below would be defined in <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a> as "<i>sqlitename</i>_query".

       Normally,  the  SQL  query  is  specified  via a single <b>query</b> parameter
       (described in more detail below).  When this parameter is not specified
       in  the map definition, Postfix reverts to an older interface, with the
       SQL query constructed from the  <b>select_field</b>,  <b>table</b>,  <b>where_field</b>  and
       <b>additional_conditions</b>  parameters.  The old interface will be gradually
       phased out. To migrate to the new interface set:

           <b>query</b> = SELECT [<i>select</i><b>_</b><i>field</i>]
               FROM [<i>table</i>]
               WHERE [<i>where</i><b>_</b><i>field</i>] = '%s'
                   [<i>additional</i><b>_</b><i>conditions</i>]

       Insert the value, not the name, of each legacy parameter. Note that the
       <b>additional_conditions</b>  parameter  is  optional  and  if not empty, will
       always start with <b>AND</b>.

<b>LIST MEMBERSHIP</b>
       When using SQL to store  lists  such  as  $<a href="postconf.5.html#mynetworks">mynetworks</a>,  $<a href="postconf.5.html#mydestination">mydestination</a>,
       $<a href="postconf.5.html#relay_domains">relay_domains</a>,  $<a href="postconf.5.html#local_recipient_maps">local_recipient_maps</a>, etc., it is important to under-
       stand that the table must store each list member as a separate key. The
       table  lookup  verifies  the *existence* of the key. See "Postfix lists
       versus tables" in the <a href="DATABASE_README.html">DATABASE_README</a> document for a discussion.

       Do NOT create tables that return the full list of domains in  $<a href="postconf.5.html#mydestination">mydesti</a>-
       <a href="postconf.5.html#mydestination">nation</a> or $<a href="postconf.5.html#relay_domains">relay_domains</a> etc., or IP addresses in $<a href="postconf.5.html#mynetworks">mynetworks</a>.

       DO create tables with each matching item as a key and with an arbitrary
       value. With SQL databases it is not uncommon to return the  key  itself
       or a constant value.

<b>SQLITE PARAMETERS</b>
       <b>dbpath</b> The SQLite database file location. Example:
                  dbpath = customer_database

       <b>query</b>  The  SQL query template used to search the database, where <b>%s</b> is
              a substitute for the address Postfix is trying to resolve,  e.g.
                  query = SELECT replacement FROM aliases WHERE mailbox = '%s'

              This parameter supports the following '%' expansions:

              <b>%%</b>     This is replaced by a literal '%' character.

              <b>%s</b>     This  is  replaced by the input key.  SQL quoting is used
                     to make sure that the input key does not  add  unexpected
                     metacharacters.

              <b>%u</b>     When the input key is an address of the form user@domain,
                     <b>%u</b> is replaced by  the  SQL  quoted  local  part  of  the
                     address.   Otherwise, <b>%u</b> is replaced by the entire search
                     string.  If the localpart is empty,  the  query  is  sup-
                     pressed and returns no results.

              <b>%d</b>     When the input key is an address of the form user@domain,
                     <b>%d</b> is replaced by the  SQL  quoted  domain  part  of  the
                     address.   Otherwise, the query is suppressed and returns
                     no results.

              <b>%[SUD]</b> The upper-case equivalents of the above expansions behave
                     in  the  <b>query</b>  parameter identically to their lower-case
                     counter-parts.  With  the  <b>result_format</b>  parameter  (see
                     below),  they expand the input key rather than the result
                     value.

              <b>%[1-9]</b> The patterns %1, %2, ... %9 are replaced  by  the  corre-
                     sponding  most  significant  component of the input key's
                     domain. If the input key is  <i>user@mail.example.com</i>,  then
                     %1 is <b>com</b>, %2 is <b>example</b> and %3 is <b>mail</b>. If the input key
                     is unqualified or does not have enough domain  components
                     to  satisfy all the specified patterns, the query is sup-
                     pressed and returns no results.

              The <b>domain</b> parameter described below limits the  input  keys  to
              addresses  in  matching  domains.  When  the <b>domain</b> parameter is
              non-empty, SQL queries for unqualified addresses or addresses in
              non-matching domains are suppressed and return no results.

              This  parameter is available with Postfix 2.2. In prior releases
              the  SQL  query  was  built  from   the   separate   parameters:
              <b>select_field</b>,  <b>table</b>, <b>where_field</b> and <b>additional_conditions</b>. The
              mapping from the old parameters to the equivalent query is:

                  SELECT [<b>select_field</b>]
                  FROM [<b>table</b>]
                  WHERE [<b>where_field</b>] = '%s'
                        [<b>additional_conditions</b>]

              The '%s' in the <b>WHERE</b>  clause  expands  to  the  escaped  search
              string.   With  Postfix  2.2 these legacy parameters are used if
              the <b>query</b> parameter is not specified.

              NOTE: DO NOT put quotes around the query parameter.

       <b>result_format (default: %s</b>)
              Format template applied to result attributes. Most commonly used
              to  append  (or prepend) text to the result. This parameter sup-
              ports the following '%' expansions:

              <b>%%</b>     This is replaced by a literal '%' character.

              <b>%s</b>     This is replaced by the value of  the  result  attribute.
                     When result is empty it is skipped.

              <b>%u</b>     When the result attribute value is an address of the form
                     user@domain, <b>%u</b> is replaced by  the  local  part  of  the
                     address.  When  the  result  has an empty localpart it is
                     skipped.

              <b>%d</b>     When a result attribute value is an address of  the  form
                     user@domain,  <b>%d</b>  is  replaced  by the domain part of the
                     attribute value. When the result  is  unqualified  it  is
                     skipped.

              <b>%[SUD1-9]</b>
                     The  upper-case  and decimal digit expansions interpolate
                     the parts of the input key rather than the result.  Their
                     behavior  is  identical to that described with <b>query</b>, and
                     in fact because  the  input  key  is  known  in  advance,
                     queries  whose  key  does not contain all the information
                     specified in  the  result  template  are  suppressed  and
                     return no results.

              For example, using "result_format = <a href="smtp.8.html">smtp</a>:[%s]" allows one to use
              a mailHost attribute as the basis of a <a href="transport.5.html">transport(5)</a> table. After
              applying  the result format, multiple values are concatenated as
              comma  separated  strings.  The  expansion_limit  and  parameter
              explained  below  allows one to restrict the number of values in
              the result, which is especially useful for maps that must return
              at most one value.

              The  default value <b>%s</b> specifies that each result value should be
              used as is.

              This parameter is available with Postfix 2.2 and later.

              NOTE: DO NOT put quotes around the result format!

       <b>domain (default: no domain list)</b>
              This is a list of domain names, paths to files, or dictionaries.
              When   specified,  only  fully  qualified  search  keys  with  a
              *non-empty* localpart and a matching  domain  are  eligible  for
              lookup:  'user'  lookups,  bare  domain  lookups  and  "@domain"
              lookups are not performed. This  can  significantly  reduce  the
              query load on the SQLite server.
                  domain = postfix.org, <a href="DATABASE_README.html#types">hash</a>:/etc/postfix/searchdomains

              It  is best not to use SQL to store the domains eligible for SQL
              lookups.

              This parameter is available with Postfix 2.2 and later.

              NOTE: DO NOT define this parameter for <a href="local.8.html">local(8)</a> aliases, because
              the input keys are always unqualified.

       <b>expansion_limit (default: 0)</b>
              A  limit  on  the total number of result elements returned (as a
              comma separated list) by a lookup against the map.  A setting of
              zero  disables the limit. Lookups fail with a temporary error if
              the limit is exceeded.  Setting the  limit  to  1  ensures  that
              lookups do not return multiple values.

<b>OBSOLETE QUERY INTERFACE</b>
       This  section  describes  an interface that is deprecated as of Postfix
       2.2. It is replaced by  the  more  general  <b>query</b>  interface  described
       above.   If  the  <b>query</b>  parameter  is  defined,  the legacy parameters
       described here ignored.  Please migrate to the  new  interface  as  the
       legacy interface may be removed in a future release.

       The  following  parameters  can  be  used  to fill in a SELECT template
       statement of the form:

           SELECT [<b>select_field</b>]
           FROM [<b>table</b>]
           WHERE [<b>where_field</b>] = '%s'
                 [<b>additional_conditions</b>]

       The specifier %s is replaced by the search string, and is escaped so if
       it  contains single quotes or other odd characters, it will not cause a
       parse error, or worse, a security problem.

       <b>select_field</b>
              The SQL "select" parameter. Example:
                  <b>select_field</b> = forw_addr

       <b>table</b>  The SQL "select .. from" table name. Example:
                  <b>table</b> = mxaliases

       <b>where_field</b>
              The SQL "select .. where" parameter. Example:
                  <b>where_field</b> = alias

       <b>additional_conditions</b>
              Additional conditions to the SQL query. Example:
                  <b>additional_conditions</b> = AND status = 'paid'
