SQLITE_TABLE(5)                                                SQLITE_TABLE(5)

<b>NAME</b>
       sqlite_table - Postfix SQLite configuration

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>postmap -q "</b><i>string</i><b>" <a href="sqlite_table.5.html">sqlite</a>:/etc/postfix/filename</b>

       <b>postmap -q - <a href="sqlite_table.5.html">sqlite</a>:/etc/postfix/</b><i>filename</i> &lt;<i>inputfile</i>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  Postfix  mail system uses optional tables for address
       rewriting or mail routing. These tables are usually in <b>dbm</b>
       or <b>db</b> format.

       Alternatively,  lookup  tables  can be specified as SQLite
       databases.  In order to  use  SQLite  lookups,  define  an
       SQLite source as a lookup table in <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>, for example:
           <a href="postconf.5.html#alias_maps">alias_maps</a> = <a href="sqlite_table.5.html">sqlite</a>:/etc/sqlite-aliases.cf

       The  file /etc/postfix/sqlite-aliases.cf has the same for-
       mat as the Postfix  <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>  file,  and  can  specify  the
       parameters described below.

<b>BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY</b>
       For compatibility with other Postfix lookup tables, SQLite
       parameters can also be defined in <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>.  In order to do
       that,  specify  as SQLite source a name that doesn't begin
       with a slash or a dot.  The SQLite parameters will then be
       accessible as the name you've given the source in its def-
       inition, an underscore, and the  name  of  the  parameter.
       For  example,  if  the map is specified as "<a href="sqlite_table.5.html">sqlite</a>:<i>sqlite-</i>
       <i>name</i>", the parameter "query" below  would  be  defined  in
       <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a> as "<i>sqlitename</i>_query".

       Normally,  the  SQL  query is specified via a single <b>query</b>
       parameter (described in more  detail  below).   When  this
       parameter  is not specified in the map definition, Postfix
       reverts to an older interface, with  the  SQL  query  con-
       structed  from  the  <b>select_field</b>,  <b>table</b>, <b>where_field</b> and
       <b>additional_conditions</b> parameters.  The old interface  will
       be  gradually  phased out. To migrate to the new interface
       set:

           <b>query</b> = SELECT [<i>select</i><b>_</b><i>field</i>]
               FROM [<i>table</i>]
               WHERE [<i>where</i><b>_</b><i>field</i>] = '%s'
                   [<i>additional</i><b>_</b><i>conditions</i>]

       Insert the value, not the name, of each legacy  parameter.
       Note  that the <b>additional_conditions</b> parameter is optional
       and if not empty, will always start with <b>AND</b>.

<b>LIST MEMBERSHIP</b>
       When using SQL to store lists such as $<a href="postconf.5.html#mynetworks">mynetworks</a>, $<a href="postconf.5.html#mydestination">mydes</a>-
       <a href="postconf.5.html#mydestination">tination</a>,  $<a href="postconf.5.html#relay_domains">relay_domains</a>, $<a href="postconf.5.html#local_recipient_maps">local_recipient_maps</a>, etc., it
       is important to understand that the table must store  each
       list  member  as a separate key. The table lookup verifies
       the *existence* of the  key.  See  "Postfix  lists  versus
       tables"  in the <a href="DATABASE_README.html">DATABASE_README</a> document for a discussion.

       Do NOT create tables that return the full list of  domains
       in  $<a href="postconf.5.html#mydestination">mydestination</a> or $<a href="postconf.5.html#relay_domains">relay_domains</a> etc., or IP addresses
       in $<a href="postconf.5.html#mynetworks">mynetworks</a>.

       DO create tables with each matching item as a key and with
       an  arbitrary value. With SQL databases it is not uncommon
       to return the key itself or a constant value.

<b>SQLITE PARAMETERS</b>
       <b>dbpath</b> The SQLite database file location. Example:
                  dbpath = customer_database

       <b>query</b>  The SQL query template used to search the database,
              where <b>%s</b> is a substitute for the address Postfix is
              trying to resolve, e.g.
                  query = SELECT replacement FROM aliases WHERE mailbox = '%s'

              This parameter supports the  following  '%'  expan-
              sions:

              <b>%%</b>     This is replaced by a literal '%' character.

              <b>%s</b>     This is replaced  by  the  input  key.   SQL
                     quoting  is used to make sure that the input
                     key does not add unexpected  metacharacters.

              <b>%u</b>     When the input key is an address of the form
                     user@domain,  <b>%u</b>  is  replaced  by  the  SQL
                     quoted  local  part  of the address.  Other-
                     wise, <b>%u</b> is replaced by  the  entire  search
                     string.   If  the  localpart  is  empty, the
                     query is suppressed and returns no  results.

              <b>%d</b>     When the input key is an address of the form
                     user@domain,  <b>%d</b>  is  replaced  by  the  SQL
                     quoted  domain  part of the address.  Other-
                     wise, the query is suppressed and returns no
                     results.

              <b>%[SUD]</b> The  upper-case  equivalents  of  the  above
                     expansions behave  in  the  <b>query</b>  parameter
                     identically  to  their  lower-case  counter-
                     parts.   With  the  <b>result_format</b>  parameter
                     (see  below),  they  expand  the  input  key
                     rather than the result value.

              <b>%[1-9]</b> The patterns %1, %2, ... %9 are replaced  by
                     the corresponding most significant component
                     of the input key's domain. If the input  key
                     is <i>user@mail.example.com</i>, then %1 is <b>com</b>, %2
                     is <b>example</b> and %3 is <b>mail</b>. If the input  key
                     is  unqualified  or  does  not  have  enough
                     domain components to satisfy all the  speci-
                     fied  patterns,  the query is suppressed and
                     returns no results.

              The <b>domain</b> parameter  described  below  limits  the
              input  keys  to addresses in matching domains. When
              the <b>domain</b> parameter is non-empty, SQL queries  for
              unqualified  addresses or addresses in non-matching
              domains are suppressed and return no results.

              This parameter is available with  Postfix  2.2.  In
              prior  releases  the  SQL  query was built from the
              separate    parameters:    <b>select_field</b>,     <b>table</b>,
              <b>where_field</b>  and <b>additional_conditions</b>. The mapping
              from the old parameters to the equivalent query is:

                  SELECT [<b>select_field</b>]
                  FROM [<b>table</b>]
                  WHERE [<b>where_field</b>] = '%s'
                        [<b>additional_conditions</b>]

              The '%s' in the <b>WHERE</b> clause expands to the escaped
              search  string.   With  Postfix  2.2  these  legacy
              parameters  are  used if the <b>query</b> parameter is not
              specified.

              NOTE: DO NOT put quotes around the query parameter.

       <b>result_format (default: %s</b>)
              Format  template applied to result attributes. Most
              commonly used to append (or prepend)  text  to  the
              result.  This  parameter supports the following '%'
              expansions:

              <b>%%</b>     This is replaced by a literal '%' character.

              <b>%s</b>     This  is replaced by the value of the result
                     attribute.  When  result  is  empty  it   is
                     skipped.

              <b>%u</b>     When   the  result  attribute  value  is  an
                     address  of  the  form  user@domain,  <b>%u</b>  is
                     replaced  by  the local part of the address.
                     When the result has an empty localpart it is
                     skipped.

              <b>%d</b>     When  a result attribute value is an address
                     of the form user@domain, <b>%d</b> is  replaced  by
                     the domain part of the attribute value. When
                     the result is unqualified it is skipped.

              <b>%[SUD1-9]</b>
                     The upper-case and decimal digit  expansions
                     interpolate  the  parts  of  the  input  key
                     rather than the result.  Their  behavior  is
                     identical  to that described with <b>query</b>, and
                     in fact because the input key  is  known  in
                     advance,  queries whose key does not contain
                     all the information specified in the  result
                     template   are   suppressed  and  return  no
                     results.

              For  example,  using  "result_format  =  <a href="smtp.8.html">smtp</a>:[%s]"
              allows one to use a mailHost attribute as the basis
              of a <a href="transport.5.html">transport(5)</a> table. After applying the  result
              format,  multiple  values are concatenated as comma
              separated strings. The expansion_limit and  parame-
              ter explained below allows one to restrict the num-
              ber of values in the result,  which  is  especially
              useful for maps that must return at most one value.

              The default value <b>%s</b>  specifies  that  each  result
              value should be used as is.

              This  parameter  is  available with Postfix 2.2 and
              later.

              NOTE: DO NOT put quotes around the result format!

       <b>domain (default: no domain list)</b>
              This is a list of domain names, paths to files,  or
              dictionaries.  When specified, only fully qualified
              search keys with  a  *non-empty*  localpart  and  a
              matching  domain  are  eligible  for lookup: 'user'
              lookups, bare domain lookups and "@domain"  lookups
              are  not  performed.  This can significantly reduce
              the query load on the SQLite server.
                  domain = postfix.org, hash:/etc/postfix/searchdomains

              It is best not to use SQL to store the domains eli-
              gible for SQL lookups.

              This  parameter  is  available with Postfix 2.2 and
              later.

              NOTE: DO NOT define  this  parameter  for  <a href="local.8.html">local(8)</a>
              aliases, because the input keys are always unquali-
              fied.

       <b>expansion_limit (default: 0)</b>
              A limit on the  total  number  of  result  elements
              returned  (as  a  comma separated list) by a lookup
              against the map.  A setting of  zero  disables  the
              limit.  Lookups  fail with a temporary error if the
              limit is exceeded.  Setting the limit to 1  ensures
              that lookups do not return multiple values.

<b>OBSOLETE QUERY INTERFACE</b>
       This  section describes an interface that is deprecated as
       of Postfix 2.2. It is replaced by the more  general  <b>query</b>
       interface  described  above.   If  the  <b>query</b> parameter is
       defined, the legacy  parameters  described  here  ignored.
       Please  migrate  to the new interface as the legacy inter-
       face may be removed in a future release.

       The following parameters can be used to fill in  a  SELECT
       template statement of the form:

           SELECT [<b>select_field</b>]
           FROM [<b>table</b>]
           WHERE [<b>where_field</b>] = '%s'
                 [<b>additional_conditions</b>]

       The  specifier %s is replaced by the search string, and is
       escaped so if it contains single quotes or other odd char-
       acters, it will not cause a parse error, or worse, a secu-
       rity problem.

       <b>select_field</b>
              The SQL "select" parameter. Example:
                  <b>select_field</b> = forw_addr

       <b>table</b>  The SQL "select .. from" table name. Example:
                  <b>table</b> = mxaliases

       <b>where_field</b>
              The SQL "select .. where" parameter. Example:
                  <b>where_field</b> = alias

       <b>additional_conditions</b>
              Additional conditions to the SQL query. Example:
                  <b>additional_conditions</b> = AND status = 'paid'
