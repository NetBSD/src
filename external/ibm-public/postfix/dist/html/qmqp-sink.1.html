QMQP-SINK(1)                                                      QMQP-SINK(1)

<b>NAME</b>
       qmqp-sink - parallelized QMQP test server

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>qmqp-sink</b> [<b>-46cv</b>] [<b>-x</b> <i>time</i>] [<b>inet:</b>][<i>host</i>]:<i>port backlog</i>

       <b>qmqp-sink</b> [<b>-46cv</b>] [<b>-x</b> <i>time</i>] <b>unix:</b><i>pathname backlog</i>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <b>qmqp-sink</b> listens on the named host (or address) and port.  It receives
       messages from the network and throws them away.  The purpose is to mea-
       sure QMQP client performance, not protocol compliance.  Connections can
       be accepted on IPv4 or IPv6 endpoints, or on UNIX-domain sockets.  IPv4
       and  IPv6  are  the  default.   This  program  is the complement of the
       <a href="qmqp-source.1.html"><b>qmqp-source</b>(1)</a> program.

       Note: this is an unsupported test program. No attempt is made to  main-
       tain compatibility between successive versions.

       Arguments:

       <b>-4</b>     Support  IPv4  only.  This  option has no effect when Postfix is
              built without IPv6 support.

       <b>-6</b>     Support IPv6 only. This option is not available when Postfix  is
              built without IPv6 support.

       <b>-c</b>     Display a running counter that is updated whenever a delivery is
              completed.

       <b>-v</b>     Increase verbosity. Specify <b>-v -v</b> to see some of the  QMQP  con-
              versation.

       <b>-x</b> <i>time</i>
              Terminate  after <i>time</i> seconds. This is to facilitate memory leak
              testing.
