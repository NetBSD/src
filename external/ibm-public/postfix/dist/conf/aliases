# ALIASES(5)                                                          ALIASES(5)
# 
# NAME
#        aliases - Postfix local alias database format
# 
# SYNOPSIS
#        newaliases
# 
# DESCRIPTION
#        The  aliases(5)  table provides a system-wide mechanism to
#        redirect mail for local recipients. The  redirections  are
#        processed by the Postfix local(8) delivery agent.
# 
#        Normally, the aliases(5) table is specified as a text file
#        that serves as input  to  the  postalias(1)  command.  The
#        result,  an  indexed file in dbm or db format, is used for
#        fast lookup  by  the  mail  system.  Execute  the  command
#        newaliases  in  order  to  rebuild  the indexed file after
#        changing the Postfix alias database.
# 
#        When the table is provided via other means  such  as  NIS,
#        LDAP  or  SQL,  the  same lookups are done as for ordinary
#        indexed files.
# 
#        Alternatively, the  table  can  be  provided  as  a  regu-
#        lar-expression  map  where  patterns  are given as regular
#        expressions. In this case,  the  lookups  are  done  in  a
#        slightly  different  way as described below under "REGULAR
#        EXPRESSION TABLES".
# 
#        Users can control delivery of their own mail by setting up
#        .forward files in their home directory.  Lines in per-user
#        .forward files have the same syntax as the right-hand side
#        of aliases(5) entries.
# 
#        The format of the alias database input file is as follows:
# 
#        o      An alias definition has the form
# 
#                    name: value1, value2, ...
# 
#        o      Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are  ignored,
#               as  are  lines whose first non-whitespace character
#               is a `#'.
# 
#        o      A logical line starts with non-whitespace  text.  A
#               line  that starts with whitespace continues a logi-
#               cal line.
# 
#        The name is a local address (no domain part).  Use  double
#        quotes  when the name contains any special characters such
#        as whitespace, `#', `:', or `@'. The  name  is  folded  to
#        lowercase, in order to make database lookups case insensi-
#        tive.
# 
#        In addition, when an alias exists for owner-name, delivery
#        diagnostics  are  directed  to that address, instead of to
#        the originator of the message.  This is typically used  to
#        direct  delivery  errors  to  the  maintainer of a mailing
#        list, who is in a better position  to  deal  with  mailing
#        list delivery problems than the originator of the undeliv-
#        ered mail.
# 
#        The value contains one or more of the following:
# 
#        address
#               Mail is forwarded to address, which  is  compatible
#               with the RFC 822 standard.
# 
#        /file/name
#               Mail  is  appended  to /file/name. See local(8) for
#               details of delivery to file.  Delivery is not  lim-
#               ited  to regular files.  For example, to dispose of
#               unwanted mail, deflect it to /dev/null.
# 
#        |command
#               Mail is piped into command. Commands  that  contain
#               special  characters,  such as whitespace, should be
#               enclosed between double quotes.  See  local(8)  for
#               details of delivery to command.
# 
#               When the command fails, a limited amount of command
#               output is mailed back  to  the  sender.   The  file
#               /usr/include/sysexits.h  defines  the expected exit
#               status codes. For example, use "|exit 67" to  simu-
#               late  a  "user  unknown"  error,  and  "|exit 0" to
#               implement an expensive black hole.
# 
#        :include:/file/name
#               Mail is sent to  the  destinations  listed  in  the
#               named file.  Lines in :include: files have the same
#               syntax as the right-hand side of alias entries.
# 
#               A  destination  can  be  any  destination  that  is
#               described in this manual page. However, delivery to
#               "|command" and /file/name is disallowed by default.
#               To  enable,  edit  the  allow_mail_to_commands  and
#               allow_mail_to_files configuration parameters.
# 
# ADDRESS EXTENSION
#        When alias database search fails, and the recipient local-
#        part  contains  the  optional  recipient  delimiter (e.g.,
#        user+foo), the  search  is  repeated  for  the  unextended
#        address (e.g., user).
# 
#        The   propagate_unmatched_extensions   parameter  controls
#        whether an unmatched address extension  (+foo)  is  propa-
#        gated to the result of table lookup.
# 
# CASE FOLDING
#        The local(8) delivery agent always folds the search string
#        to lowercase before database lookup.
# 
# REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES
#        This section describes how the table lookups  change  when
#        the table is given in the form of regular expressions. For
#        a description of regular expression lookup  table  syntax,
#        see  regexp_table(5) or pcre_table(5). NOTE: these formats
#        do not use ":" at the end of a pattern.
# 
#        Each regular expression is applied to  the  entire  search
#        string.  Thus,  a  search string user+foo is not broken up
#        into user and foo.
# 
#        Regular expressions are applied in the order as  specified
#        in  the  table,  until  a regular expression is found that
#        matches the search string.
# 
#        Lookup results are the same as with indexed file  lookups.
#        For  security  reasons there is no support for $1, $2 etc.
#        substring interpolation.
# 
# SECURITY
#        The local(8) delivery agent disallows  regular  expression
#        substitution  of $1 etc. in alias_maps, because that would
#        open a security hole.
# 
#        The local(8) delivery agent will silently ignore  requests
#        to  use  the proxymap(8) server within alias_maps. Instead
#        it will open the table directly.  Before  Postfix  version
#        2.2,  the  local(8)  delivery  agent will terminate with a
#        fatal error.
#

#               address (see prepend_delivered_header)  only  once,
#               at  the  start  of  a  delivery;  do not update the

#               .forward files.
