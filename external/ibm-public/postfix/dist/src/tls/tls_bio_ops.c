/* DESCRIPTION
/*	This module enforces VSTREAM-style timeouts on non-blocking
/*	I/O while performing TLS handshake or input/output operations.
/*
/*	The Postfix VSTREAM read/write routines invoke the
/*	tls_bio_read/write routines to send and receive plain-text
/*	data.  In addition, this module provides tls_bio_connect/accept
/*	routines that trigger the initial TLS handshake.  The
/*	tls_bio_xxx routines invoke the corresponding SSL routines
/*	that translate the requests into TLS protocol messages.
/*
/*	Whenever an SSL operation indicates that network input (or
/*	output) needs to happen, the tls_bio_xxx routines wait for
/*	the network to become readable (or writable) within the
/*	timeout limit, then retry the SSL operation. This works
/*	because the network socket is in non-blocking mode.
/*
/*	tls_bio_connect() performs the SSL_connect() operation.
/*
/*	tls_bio_accept() performs the SSL_accept() operation.
/*
/*	tls_bio_shutdown() performs the SSL_shutdown() operation.
/*
/*	tls_bio_read() performs the SSL_read() operation.
/*
/*	tls_bio_write() performs the SSL_write() operation.
/*
/*	Arguments:
/* .IP fd
/*	Network socket.
/* .IP buf
/*	Read/write buffer.
/* .IP len
/*	Read/write request size.
/* .IP timeout
/*	Read/write timeout.
/* .IP TLScontext
/*	TLS session state.
/* DIAGNOSTICS
/*	A result value > 0 means successful completion.
/*
/*	A result value < 0 means that the requested operation did
/*	not complete due to TLS protocol failure, system call
/*	failure, or for any reason described under "in addition"
/*	below.
/*
/*	A result value of 0 from tls_bio_shutdown() means that the
/*	operation is in progress. A result value of 0 from other
/*	tls_bio_ops(3) operations means that the remote party either
/*	closed the network connection or that it sent a TLS shutdown
/*	request.
/*
/*	Upon return from the tls_bio_ops(3) routines the global
/*	errno value is non-zero when the requested operation did not
/*	complete due to system call failure.
/*
/*	In addition, the result value is set to -1, and the global
/*	errno value is set to ETIMEDOUT, when some network read/write
/*	operation did not complete within the time limit.
