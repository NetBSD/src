/* DESCRIPTION
/*	This module implements application-specific mark and sweep
/*	operations on recipient lists. Operation is as follows:
/* .IP \(bu
/*	In the course of a delivery attempt each recipient is
/*	marked either as DROP (remove from recipient list) or KEEP
/*	(deliver to alternate mail server).
/* .IP \(bu
/*	After a delivery attempt any recipients marked DROP are deleted
/*	from the request, and the left-over recipients are unmarked.
/* .PP
/*	The mark/sweep algorithm is implemented in a redundant manner,
/*	and ensures that all recipients are explicitly accounted for.
/*
/*	Operations with upper case names are implemented by macros
/*	whose arguments may be evaluated more than once.
/*
/*	SMTP_RCPT_INIT() initializes application-specific recipient
/*	information and must be called before the first delivery attempt.
/*
/*	SMTP_RCPT_DROP() marks the specified recipient as DROP (remove
/*	from recipient list). It is an error to mark an already marked
/*	recipient.
/*
/*	SMTP_RCPT_KEEP() marks the specified recipient as KEEP (deliver
/*	to alternate mail server). It is an error to mark an already
/*	marked recipient.
/*
/*	SMTP_RCPT_ISMARKED() returns non-zero when the specified
/*	recipient is marked.
/*
/*	SMTP_RCPT_LEFT() returns the number of left_over recipients
/*	(the total number of marked and non-marked recipients).
/*
/*	SMTP_RCPT_MARK_COUNT() returns the number of left_over
/*	recipients that are marked.
/*
/*	smtp_rcpt_cleanup() cleans up the in-memory recipient list.
/*	It removes the recipients marked DROP from the left-over
/*	recipients, unmarks the left-over recipients, and enforces
/*	the requirement that all recipients are marked upon entry.
/*
/*	smtp_rcpt_done() logs that a recipient is completed and upon
/*	success it marks the recipient as done in the queue file.
/*	Finally, it marks the in-memory recipient as DROP.
/*
/*	Note: smtp_rcpt_done() may change the order of the recipient
/*	list.
/* DIAGNOSTICS
/*	Panic: interface violation.
/*
/*	When a recipient can't be logged as completed, the recipient is
/*	logged as deferred instead.
/* BUGS
/*	The single recipient list abstraction dates from the time
/*	that the SMTP client would give up after one SMTP session,
/*	so that each recipient was either bounced, delivered or
/*	deferred. Implicitly, all recipients were marked as DROP.
/*
/*	This abstraction is less convenient when an SMTP client
/*	must be able to deliver left-over recipients to a backup
/*	host. It might be more natural to have an input list with
/*	recipients to deliver, and an output list with left-over
/*	recipients.
