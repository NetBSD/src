/* DESCRIPTION
/*	This module handles all non-fatal errors that can happen while
/*	attempting to deliver mail via SMTP, and implements the policy
/*	of how to deal with the error. Depending on the nature of
/*	the problem, delivery of a single message is deferred, delivery
/*	of all messages to the same domain is deferred, or one or more
/*	recipients are given up as non-deliverable and a bounce log is
/*	updated. In any case, the recipient is marked as either KEEP
/*	(try again with a backup host) or DROP (delete recipient from
/*	delivery request).
/*
/*	In addition, when an unexpected response code is seen such
/*	as 3xx where only 4xx or 5xx are expected, or any error code
/*	that suggests a syntax error or something similar, the
/*	protocol error flag is set so that the postmaster receives
/*	a transcript of the session. No notification is generated for
/*	what appear to be configuration errors - very likely, they
/*	would suffer the same problem and just cause more trouble.
/*
/*	In case of a soft error, action depends on whether the error
/*	qualifies for trying the request with other mail servers (log
/*	an informational record only and try a backup server) or
/*	whether this is the final server (log recipient delivery status
/*	records and delete the recipient from the request).
/*
/*	smtp_sess_fail() takes a pre-formatted error report after
/*	failure to complete some protocol handshake.  The policy is
/*	as with smtp_site_fail().
/*
/*	smtp_site_fail() handles the case where the program fails to
/*	complete the initial handshake: the server is not reachable,
/*	is not running, does not want talk to us, or we talk to ourselves.
/*	The \fIcode\fR gives an error status code; the \fIformat\fR
/*	argument gives a textual description.
/*	The policy is: soft error, non-final server: log an informational
/*	record why the host is being skipped; soft error, final server:
/*	defer delivery of all remaining recipients and mark the destination
/*	as problematic; hard error: bounce all remaining recipients.
/*	The session is marked as "do not cache".
/*	The result is non-zero.
/*
/*	smtp_mesg_fail() handles the case where the smtp server
/*	does not accept the sender address or the message data,
/*	or when the local MTA is unable to convert the message data.
/*	The policy is: soft error, non-final server: log an informational
/*	record why the host is being skipped; soft error, final server:
/*	defer delivery of all remaining recipients; hard error: bounce all
/*	remaining recipients.
/*	The result is non-zero.
/*
/*	smtp_misc_fail() provides a more detailed interface than
/*	smtp_site_fail() and smtp_mesg_fail(), which are convenience
/*	wrappers around smtp_misc_fail(). The throttle argument
/*	is either SMTP_THROTTLE or SMTP_NOTHROTTLE; it is used only
/*	in the "soft error, final server" policy, and determines
/*	whether a destination will be marked as problematic.
/*
/*	smtp_rcpt_fail() handles the case where a recipient is not
/*	accepted by the server for reasons other than that the server
/*	recipient limit is reached.
/*	The policy is: soft error, non-final server: log an informational
/*	record why the recipient is being skipped; soft error, final server:
/*	defer delivery of this recipient; hard error: bounce this
/*	recipient.
/*
/*	smtp_stream_except() handles the exceptions generated by
/*	the smtp_stream(3) module (i.e. timeouts and I/O errors).
/*	The \fIexception\fR argument specifies the type of problem.
/*	The \fIdescription\fR argument describes at what stage of
/*	the SMTP dialog the problem happened.
/*	The policy is: non-final server: log an informational record
/*	with the reason why the host is being skipped; final server:
/*	defer delivery of all remaining recipients.
/*	Retry plaintext delivery after TLS post-handshake session
/*	failure, provided that at least one recipient was not
/*	deferred or rejected during the TLS phase, and that global
/*	preconditions for plaintext fallback are met.
/*	The session is marked as "do not cache".
/*	The result is non-zero.
/*
/*	Arguments:
/* .IP state
/*	SMTP client state per delivery request.
/* .IP resp
/*	Server response including reply code and text.
/* .IP recipient
/*	Undeliverable recipient address information.
/* .IP format
/*	Human-readable description of why mail is not deliverable.
/* DIAGNOSTICS
/*	Panic: unknown exception code.
