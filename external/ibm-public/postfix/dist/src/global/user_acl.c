/* NAME
/*	user_acl 3
/* SUMMARY
/*	user name based access control
/* SYNOPSIS
/*	#include <user_acl.h>
/*
/*	const char *check_user_acl_byuid(pname, acl, uid)
/*	const char *pname;
/*	const char *acl;
/*	uid_t	uid;
/* DESCRIPTION
/*	check_user_acl_byuid() converts the given uid into a user
/*	name, and checks the result against a user name matchlist.
/*	If the uid cannot be resolved to a user name, "unknown"
/*	is used as the lookup key instead.
/*	The result is NULL on success, the username upon failure.
/*	The error result lives in static storage and must be saved
/*	if it is to be used to across multiple check_user_acl_byuid()
/*	calls.
/*
/*	Arguments:
/* .IP pname
/*	The parameter name of the acl.
/* .IP acl
/*	Authorized user name list suitable for input to string_list_init(3).
/* .IP uid
/*	The uid to be checked against the access list.

     * XXX: Substitute "unknown" for UIDs without username, so that
     * static:anyone results in "permit" even when the uid is not found in
     * the password file, and so that a pattern of !unknown can be used to
     * block non-existent accounts.
     * 
     * The alternative is to use the UID as a surrogate lookup key for
     * non-existent accounts. There are several reasons why this is not a
     * good idea. 1) An ACL with a numerical UID should work regardless of
     * whether or not an account has a password file entry. Therefore we
     * would always have search on the numerical UID whenever the username
     * fails to produce a match. 2) The string-list infrastructure is not
     * really suitable for mixing numerical and non-numerical user
     * information, because the numerical match is done in a separate pass
     * from the non-numerical match. This breaks when the ! operator is used.
     * 
     * XXX To avoid waiting until the lookup completes (e.g., LDAP or NIS down)
     * invoke mypwuid_err(), and either change the user_acl() API to
     * propagate the error to the caller, or treat lookup errors as fatal.
