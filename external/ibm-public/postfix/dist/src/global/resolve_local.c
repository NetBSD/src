/* NAME
/*	resolve_local 3
/* SUMMARY
/*	determine if domain resolves to local mail system
/* SYNOPSIS
/*	#include <resolve_local.h>
/*
/*	void	resolve_local_init()
/*
/*	int	resolve_local(domain)
/*	const char *domain;
/* DESCRIPTION
/*	resolve_local() determines if the named domain resolves to the
/*	local mail system, either by case-insensitive exact match
/*	against the domains, files or tables listed in $mydestination,
/*	or by a match of an [address-literal] against of the network
/*	addresses listed in $inet_interfaces or in $proxy_interfaces.
/*	The result is > 0 if the domain matches the list of local
/*	domains and IP addresses, 0 when it does not match, and < 0
/*	in case of error.
/*
/*	resolve_local_init() performs initialization. If this routine is
/*	not called explicitly ahead of time, it will be called on the fly.
/* BUGS
/*	Calling resolve_local_init() on the fly is an incomplete solution.
/*	It is bound to fail with applications that enter a chroot jail.

     * Compare the destination against the list of interface addresses that

     * 
     * The destination may be an IPv6 address literal that was buried somewhere
     * inside a deeply recursively nested address. This information comes
     * from an untrusted source, and Wietse is not confident that everyone's
     * getaddrinfo() etc. implementation is sufficiently robust. The syntax
     * is complex enough with null field compression and with IPv4-in-IPv6
     * addresses that errors are likely.
     * 
     * The solution below is ad-hoc. We neutralize the string as soon as we
     * realize that its contents could be harmful. We neutralize the string
     * here, instead of neutralizing it in every resolve_local() caller.
     * That's because resolve_local knows how the address is going to be
     * parsed and converted into binary form.
     * 
     * There are several more structural solutions to this.
     * 
     * - One solution is to disallow address literals. This is not as bad as it
     * seems: I have never seen actual legitimate use of address literals.
     * 
     * - Another solution is to label each string with a trustworthiness label
     * and to expect that all Postfix infrastructure will exercise additional
     * caution when given a string with untrusted content. This is not likely
     * to happen.
     * 
     * FIX 200501 IPv6 patch did not require "IPv6:" prefix in numerical
     * addresses.
