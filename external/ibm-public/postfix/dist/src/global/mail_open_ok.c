/* NAME
/*	mail_open_ok 3
/* SUMMARY
/*	scrutinize mail queue file
/* SYNOPSIS
/*	#include <mail_open_ok.h>
/*
/*	int	mail_open_ok(queue_name, queue_id, statp, pathp)
/*	const char *queue_name;
/*	const char *queue_id;
/*	struct stat *statp;
/*	char	**pathp
/* DESCRIPTION
/*	mail_open_ok() determines if it is OK to open the specified
/*	queue file.
/*
/*	The queue name and queue id should conform to the syntax
/*	requirements for these names.
/*	Unfortunately, on some systems readdir() etc. can return bogus
/*	file names. For this reason, the code silently ignores invalid
/*	queue file names.
/*
/*	The file should have mode 0700. Files with other permissions
/*	are silently ignored.
/*
/*	The file should be a regular file.
/*	Files that do not satisfy this requirement are skipped with
/*	a warning.
/*
/*	The file link count is not restricted. With a writable maildrop
/*	directory, refusal to deliver linked files is prone to denial of
/*	service attack; it's better to deliver mail too often than not.
/*
/*	Upon return, the \fIstatp\fR argument receives the file
/*	attributes and \fIpathp\fR a copy of the file name. The file
/*	name is volatile. Make a copy if it is to be used for any
/*	appreciable amount of time.
/* DIAGNOSTICS
/*	Warnings: bad file attributes (file type), multiple hard links.
/*	mail_open_ok() returns MAIL_OPEN_YES for good files, MAIL_OPEN_NO
/*	for anything else. It is left up to the system administrator to
/*	deal with non-file objects.
/* BUGS
/*	mail_open_ok() examines a queue file without actually opening
/*	it, and therefore is susceptible to race conditions.
/* LICENSE
