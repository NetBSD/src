/* NAME
/*	mail_error 3
/* SUMMARY
/*	mail error classes
/* SYNOPSIS
/*	#include <mail_error.h>
/*
/*	NAME_MASK mail_error_masks[];
/* DESCRIPTION
/*	This module implements error class support.
/*
/*	mail_error_masks[] is a null-terminated table with mail error
/*	class names and their corresponding bit masks.
/*
/*	The following is a list of implemented names, with the
/*	corresponding bit masks indicated in parentheses:
/* .IP "bounce (MAIL_ERROR_BOUNCE)"
/*	A message could not be delivered because it was too large,
/*	because was sent via too many hops, because the recipient
/*	does not exist, and so on.
/* .IP "2bounce (MAIL_ERROR_2BOUNCE)"
/*	A bounce message could not be delivered.
/* .IP "dat (MAIL_ERROR_DATA)"
/*	A message could not be delivered because a critical data
/*	file was unavailable.
/* .IP "policy (MAIL_ERROR_POLICY)"
/*	Policy violation. This depends on what restrictions have
/*	been configured locally.
/* .IP "protocol (MAIL_ERROR_PROTOCOL)"
/*	Protocol violation. Something did not follow the appropriate
/*	standard, or something requested an unimplemented service.
/* .IP "resource (MAIL_ERROR_RESOURCE)"
/*	A message could not be delivered due to lack of system
/*	resources, for example, lack of file system space.
/* .IP "software (MAIL_ERROR_SOFTWARE)"
/*	Software bug. The author of this program made a mistake.
/*	Fixing this requires change to the software.
/* SEE ALSO
/*	name_mask(3), name to mask conversion
