/* NAME
/*	postsuper 1
/* SUMMARY
/*	Postfix superintendent
/* SYNOPSIS
/* .fi
/*	\fBpostsuper\fR [\fB-psSv\fR]
/*	[\fB-c \fIconfig_dir\fR] [\fB-d \fIqueue_id\fR]
/*		[\fB-h \fIqueue_id\fR] [\fB-H \fIqueue_id\fR]
/*		[\fB-r \fIqueue_id\fR] [\fIdirectory ...\fR]
/* DESCRIPTION
/*	The \fBpostsuper\fR(1) command does maintenance jobs on the Postfix
/*	queue. Use of the command is restricted to the superuser.
/*	See the \fBpostqueue\fR(1) command for unprivileged queue operations
/*	such as listing or flushing the mail queue.
/*
/*	By default, \fBpostsuper\fR(1) performs the operations
/*	requested with the
/*	\fB-s\fR and \fB-p\fR command-line options on all Postfix queue
/*	directories - this includes the \fBincoming\fR, \fBactive\fR and
/*	\fBdeferred\fR directories with mail files and the \fBbounce\fR,
/*	\fBdefer\fR, \fBtrace\fR and \fBflush\fR directories with log files.
/*
/*	Options:
/* .IP "\fB-c \fIconfig_dir\fR"
/*	The \fBmain.cf\fR configuration file is in the named directory
/*	instead of the default configuration directory. See also the
/*	MAIL_CONFIG environment setting below.
/* .IP "\fB-d \fIqueue_id\fR"
/*	Delete one message with the named queue ID from the named
/*	mail queue(s) (default: \fBhold\fR, \fBincoming\fR, \fBactive\fR and
/*	\fBdeferred\fR).
/*
/*	If a \fIqueue_id\fR of \fB-\fR is specified, the program reads
/*	queue IDs from standard input. For example, to delete all mail
/*	with exactly one recipient \fBuser@example.com\fR:
/* .sp
/* .nf
/*	mailq | tail +2 | grep -v '^ *(' | awk  \'BEGIN { RS = "" }
/*	    # $7=sender, $8=recipient1, $9=recipient2
/*	    { if ($8 == "user@example.com" && $9 == "")
/*	          print $1 }
/*	\' | tr -d '*!' | postsuper -d -
/* .fi
/* .sp
/*	Specify "\fB-d ALL\fR" to remove all messages; for example, specify
/*	"\fB-d ALL deferred\fR" to delete all mail in the \fBdeferred\fR queue.
/*	As a safety measure, the word \fBALL\fR must be specified in upper
/*	case.
/* .sp
/*	Warning: Postfix queue IDs are reused (always with Postfix
/*	<= 2.8; and with Postfix >= 2.9 when enable_long_queue_ids=no).
/*	There is a very small possibility that postsuper deletes the
/*	wrong message file when it is executed while the Postfix mail
/*	system is delivering mail.
/* .sp
/*	The scenario is as follows:
/* .RS
/* .IP 1)
/*	The Postfix queue manager deletes the message that \fBpostsuper\fR(1)
/*	is asked to delete, because Postfix is finished with the
/*	message (it is delivered, or it is returned to the sender).
/* .IP 2)
/*	New mail arrives, and the new message is given the same queue ID
/*	as the message that \fBpostsuper\fR(1) is supposed to delete.
/*	The probability for reusing a deleted queue ID is about 1 in 2**15
/*	(the number of different microsecond values that the system clock
/*	can distinguish within a second).
/* .IP 3)
/*	\fBpostsuper\fR(1) deletes the new message, instead of the old
/*	message that it should have deleted.
/* .RE
/* .IP "\fB-h \fIqueue_id\fR"
/*	Put mail "on hold" so that no attempt is made to deliver it.
/*	Move one message with the named queue ID from the named
/*	mail queue(s) (default: \fBincoming\fR, \fBactive\fR and
/*	\fBdeferred\fR) to the \fBhold\fR queue.
/*
/*	If a \fIqueue_id\fR of \fB-\fR is specified, the program reads
/*	queue IDs from standard input.
/* .sp
/*	Specify "\fB-h ALL\fR" to hold all messages; for example, specify
/*	"\fB-h ALL deferred\fR" to hold all mail in the \fBdeferred\fR queue.
/*	As a safety measure, the word \fBALL\fR must be specified in upper
/*	case.
/* .sp
/*	Note: while mail is "on hold" it will not expire when its
/*	time in the queue exceeds the \fBmaximal_queue_lifetime\fR
/*	or \fBbounce_queue_lifetime\fR setting. It becomes subject to
/*	expiration after it is released from "hold".
/* .sp
/*	This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.
/* .IP "\fB-H \fIqueue_id\fR"
/*	Release mail that was put "on hold".
/*	Move one message with the named queue ID from the named
/*	mail queue(s) (default: \fBhold\fR) to the \fBdeferred\fR queue.
/*
/*	If a \fIqueue_id\fR of \fB-\fR is specified, the program reads
/*	queue IDs from standard input.
/* .sp
/*	Note: specify "\fBpostsuper -r\fR" to release mail that was kept on
/*	hold for a significant fraction of \fB$maximal_queue_lifetime\fR
/*	or \fB$bounce_queue_lifetime\fR, or longer.
/* .sp
/*	Specify "\fB-H ALL\fR" to release all mail that is "on hold".
/*	As a safety measure, the word \fBALL\fR must be specified in upper
/*	case.
/* .sp
/*	This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.
/* .IP \fB-p\fR
/*	Purge old temporary files that are left over after system or
/*	software crashes.
/* .IP "\fB-r \fIqueue_id\fR"
/*	Requeue the message with the named queue ID from the named
/*	mail queue(s) (default: \fBhold\fR, \fBincoming\fR, \fBactive\fR and
/*	\fBdeferred\fR).
/*	To requeue multiple messages, specify multiple \fB-r\fR
/*	command-line options.
/*
/*	Alternatively, if a \fIqueue_id\fR of \fB-\fR is specified,
/*	the program reads queue IDs from standard input.
/* .sp
/*	Specify "\fB-r ALL\fR" to requeue all messages. As a safety
/*	measure, the word \fBALL\fR must be specified in upper case.
/* .sp
/*	A requeued message is moved to the \fBmaildrop\fR queue,
/*	from where it is copied by the \fBpickup\fR(8) and
/*	\fBcleanup\fR(8) daemons to a new queue file. In many
/*	respects its handling differs from that of a new local
/*	submission.
/* .RS
/* .IP \(bu
/*	The message is not subjected to the smtpd_milters or
/*	non_smtpd_milters settings.  When mail has passed through
/*	an external content filter, this would produce incorrect
/*	results with Milter applications that depend on original
/*	SMTP connection state information.
/* .IP \(bu
/*	The message is subjected again to mail address rewriting
/*	and substitution.  This is useful when rewriting rules or
/*	virtual mappings have changed.
/* .sp
/*	The address rewriting context (local or remote) is the same
/*	as when the message was received.
/* .IP \(bu
/*	The message is subjected to the same content_filter settings
/*	(if any) as used for new local mail submissions.  This is
/*	useful when content_filter settings have changed.
/* .RE
/* .IP
/*	Warning: Postfix queue IDs are reused (always with Postfix
/*	<= 2.8; and with Postfix >= 2.9 when enable_long_queue_ids=no).
/*	There is a very small possibility that \fBpostsuper\fR(1) requeues
/*	the wrong message file when it is executed while the Postfix mail
/*	system is running, but no harm should be done.
/* .sp
/*	This feature is available in Postfix 1.1 and later.
/* .IP \fB-s\fR
/*	Structure check and structure repair.  This should be done once
/*	before Postfix startup.
/* .RS
/* .IP \(bu
/*	Rename files whose name does not match the message file inode
/*	number. This operation is necessary after restoring a mail
/*	queue from a different machine or from backup, when queue
/*	files were created with Postfix <= 2.8 or with
/*	"enable_long_queue_ids = no".
/* .IP \(bu
/*	Move queue files that are in the wrong place in the file system
/*	hierarchy and remove subdirectories that are no longer needed.
/*	File position rearrangements are necessary after a change in the
/*	\fBhash_queue_names\fR and/or \fBhash_queue_depth\fR
/*	configuration parameters.
/* .IP \(bu
/*	Rename queue files created with "enable_long_queue_ids =
/*	yes" to short names, for migration to Postfix <= 2.8.  The
/*	procedure is as follows:
/* .sp
/* .nf
/* .na
/*	# postfix stop
/*	# postconf enable_long_queue_ids=no
/*	# postsuper
/* .ad
/* .fi
/* .sp
/*	Run \fBpostsuper\fR(1) repeatedly until it stops reporting
/*	file name changes.
/* .RE
/* .IP \fB-S\fR
/*	A redundant version of \fB-s\fR that requires that long
/*	file names also match the message file inode number. This
/*	option exists for testing purposes, and is available with
/*	Postfix 2.9 and later.
/* .IP \fB-v\fR
/*	Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple \fB-v\fR
/*	options make the software increasingly verbose.
/* DIAGNOSTICS
/*	Problems are reported to the standard error stream and to
/*	\fBsyslogd\fR(8).
/*
/*	\fBpostsuper\fR(1) reports the number of messages deleted with \fB-d\fR,
/*	the number of messages requeued with \fB-r\fR, and the number of
/*	messages whose queue file name was fixed with \fB-s\fR. The report
/*	is written to the standard error stream and to \fBsyslogd\fR(8).
/* ENVIRONMENT
/* .ad
/* .fi
/* .IP MAIL_CONFIG
/*	Directory with the \fBmain.cf\fR file.
/* BUGS
/*	Mail that is not sanitized by Postfix (i.e. mail in the \fBmaildrop\fR
/*	queue) cannot be placed "on hold".
/* CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
/* .ad
/* .fi
/*	The following \fBmain.cf\fR parameters are especially relevant to
/*	this program.
/*	The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
/*	\fBpostconf\fR(5) for more details including examples.
/* .IP "\fBconfig_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)\fR"
/*	The default location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf
/*	configuration files.
/* .IP "\fBhash_queue_depth (1)\fR"
/*	The number of subdirectory levels for queue directories listed with
/*	the hash_queue_names parameter.
/* .IP "\fBhash_queue_names (deferred, defer)\fR"
/*	The names of queue directories that are split across multiple
/*	subdirectory levels.
/* .IP "\fBqueue_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)\fR"
/*	The location of the Postfix top-level queue directory.
/* .IP "\fBsyslog_facility (mail)\fR"
/*	The syslog facility of Postfix logging.
/* .IP "\fBsyslog_name (see 'postconf -d' output)\fR"
/*	The mail system name that is prepended to the process name in syslog
/*	records, so that "smtpd" becomes, for example, "postfix/smtpd".
/* .PP
/*	Available in Postfix version 2.9 and later:
/* .IP "\fBenable_long_queue_ids (no)\fR"
/*	Enable long, non-repeating, queue IDs (queue file names).
