/* DESCRIPTION
/*	This module implements a callable interface to the cleanup service
/*	for processing one message and for writing it to queue file.
/*	For a description of the cleanup service, see cleanup(8).
/*
/*	cleanup_open() creates a new queue file and performs other
/*	per-message initialization. The result is a handle that should be
/*	given to the cleanup_control(), cleanup_record(), cleanup_flush()
/*	and cleanup_free() routines. The name of the queue file is in the
/*	queue_id result structure member.
/*
/*	cleanup_control() processes per-message flags specified by the caller.
/*	These flags control the handling of data errors, and must be set
/*	before processing the first message record.
/* .IP CLEANUP_FLAG_BOUNCE
/*	The cleanup server is responsible for returning undeliverable
/*	mail (too many hops, message too large) to the sender.
/* .IP CLEANUP_FLAG_BCC_OK
/*	It is OK to add automatic BCC recipient addresses.
/* .IP CLEANUP_FLAG_FILTER
/*	Enable header/body filtering. This should be enabled only with mail
/*	that enters Postfix, not with locally forwarded mail or with bounce
/*	messages.
/* .IP CLEANUP_FLAG_MILTER
/*	Enable Milter applications. This should be enabled only with mail
/*	that enters Postfix, not with locally forwarded mail or with bounce
/*	messages.
/* .IP CLEANUP_FLAG_MAP_OK
/*	Enable canonical and virtual mapping, and address masquerading.
/* .PP
/*	For convenience the CLEANUP_FLAG_MASK_EXTERNAL macro specifies
/*	the options that are normally needed for mail that enters
/*	Postfix from outside, and CLEANUP_FLAG_MASK_INTERNAL specifies
/*	the options that are normally needed for internally generated or
/*	forwarded mail.
/*
/*	CLEANUP_RECORD() is a macro that processes one message record,
/*	that copies the result to the queue file, and that maintains a
/*	little state machine. The last record in a valid message has type
/*	REC_TYPE_END.  In order to find out if a message is corrupted,
/*	the caller is encouraged to test the CLEANUP_OUT_OK(state) macro.
/*	The result is false when further message processing is futile.
/*	In that case, it is safe to call cleanup_flush() immediately.
/*
/*	cleanup_flush() closes a queue file. In case of any errors,
/*	the file is removed. The result value is non-zero in case of
/*	problems. In some cases a human-readable text can be found in
/*	the state->reason member. In all other cases, use cleanup_strerror()
/*	to translate the result into human-readable text.
/*
/*	cleanup_free() destroys its argument.
/* .IP CLEANUP_FLAG_SMTPUTF8
/*	Request SMTPUTF8 support when delivering mail.
/* .IP CLEANUP_FLAG_AUTOUTF8
/*	Autodetection: request SMTPUTF8 support if the message
/*	contains an UTF8 message header, sender, or recipient.
/* DIAGNOSTICS
/*	Problems and transactions are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8).
