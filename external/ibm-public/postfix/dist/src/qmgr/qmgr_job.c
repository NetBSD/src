/* SYNOPSIS
/*	#include "qmgr.h"
/*

/*	QMGR_MESSAGE *message;
/*	QMGR_TRANSPORT *transport;

/*	void	qmgr_job_blocker_update(queue)
/*	QMGR_QUEUE *queue;
/* DESCRIPTION
/*	These routines add/delete/manipulate per-transport jobs.
/*	Each job corresponds to a specific transport and message.
/*	Each job has a peer list containing all pending delivery
/*	requests for that message.
/*
/*	qmgr_job_obtain() finds an existing job for named message and
/*	transport combination. New empty job is created if no existing can
/*	be found. In either case, the job is prepared for assignment of
/*	(more) message recipients.
/*
/*	qmgr_job_free() disposes of a per-transport job after all
/*	its entries have been taken care of. It is an error to dispose
/*	of a job that is still in use.
/*
/*	qmgr_job_entry_select() attempts to find the next entry suitable
/*	for delivery. The job preempting algorithm is also exercised.
/*	If necessary, an attempt to read more recipients into core is made.
/*	This can result in creation of more job, queue and entry structures.
/*
/*	qmgr_job_blocker_update() updates the status of blocked
/*	jobs after a decrease in the queue's concurrency level,
/*	after the queue is throttled, or after the queue is resumed
/*	from suspension.
/*
/*	qmgr_job_move_limits() takes care of proper distribution of the
/*	per-transport recipients limit among the per-transport jobs.
/*	Should be called whenever a job's recipient slot becomes available.
/* DIAGNOSTICS
/*	Panic: consistency check failure.
