/* DESCRIPTION
/*	The functions in this module overwrite the per-test expiration
/*	time stamps and all flags bits.  Some functions are implemented
/*	as unsafe macros, meaning they evaluate one or more arguments
/*	multiple times.
/*
/*	PSC_INIT_TESTS() is an unsafe macro that sets the per-test
/*	expiration time stamps to PSC_TIME_STAMP_INVALID, and that
/*	zeroes all the flags bits. These values are not meant to
/*	be stored into the postscreen(8) cache.
/*
/*	psc_new_tests() sets all test expiration time stamps to
/*	PSC_TIME_STAMP_NEW, and overwrites all flags bits. Only
/*	enabled tests are flagged with PSC_STATE_FLAG_TODO; the
/*	object is flagged with PSC_STATE_FLAG_NEW.
/*
/*	psc_parse_tests() parses a cache file record and overwrites
/*	all flags bits. Tests are considered "expired" when they
/*	would be expired at the specified time value. Only enabled
/*	tests are flagged as "expired"; the object is flagged as
/*	"new" if some enabled tests have "new" time stamps.
/*
/*	psc_print_tests() creates a cache file record for the
/*	specified flags and per-test expiration time stamps.
/*	This may modify the time stamps for disabled tests.
/*
/*	psc_print_grey_key() prints a greylist lookup key.
