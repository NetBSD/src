/* NAME
/*	unsafe 3
/* SUMMARY
/*	are we running at non-user privileges
/* SYNOPSIS
/*	#include <safe.h>
/*
/*	int	unsafe()
/* DESCRIPTION
/*	The \fBunsafe()\fR routine attempts to determine if the process
/*	(runs with privileges or has access to information) that the
/*	controlling user has no access to. The purpose is to prevent
/*	misuse of privileges, including access to protected information.
/*
/*	The result is always false when both of the following conditions
/*	are true:
/* .IP \(bu
/*	The real UID is zero.
/* .IP \(bu
/*	The effective UID is zero.
/* .PP
/*	Otherwise, the result is true if any of the following conditions
/*	is true:
/* .IP \(bu
/*	The issetuid kernel flag is non-zero (on systems that support
/*	this concept).
/* .IP \(bu
/*	The real and effective user id differ.
/* .IP \(bu
/*	The real and effective group id differ.
/* LICENSE
/* .ad
