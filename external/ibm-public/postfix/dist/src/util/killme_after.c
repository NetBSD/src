/* NAME
/*	killme_after 3
/* SUMMARY
/*	programmed death
/* SYNOPSIS
/*	#include <killme_after.h>
/*
/*	void	killme_after(seconds)
/*	unsigned int seconds;
/* DESCRIPTION
/*	The killme_after() function does a best effort to terminate
/*	the process after the specified time, should it still exist.
/*	It is meant to be used in a signal handler, as an insurance
/*	against getting stuck somewhere while preparing for exit.
/* DIAGNOSTICS
/*	None. This routine does a best effort, damn the torpedoes.
/* LICENSE

     * 
     * Undocumented: when a process runs with PID 1, Linux won't deliver a
     * signal unless the process specifies a handler (i.e. SIG_DFL is treated
     * as SIG_IGN). Conveniently, _exit() can be used directly as a signal
     * handler. This changes the wait status that a parent would see, but in
     * the case of "init" mode on Linux, no-one would care.
