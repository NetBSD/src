/* DESCRIPTION
/*	This module implements a simple protocol for cooperative
/*	processes to update one file. The idea is to 1) create a
/*	new file under a deterministic temporary pathname, 2)
/*	populate the new file with updated information, and 3)
/*	rename the new file into the place of the original file.
/*	This module provides 1) and 3), and leaves 2) to the
/*	application. The temporary pathname is deterministic to
/*	avoid accumulation of thrash after program crashes.
/*
/*	edit_file_open() implements the first phase of the protocol.
/*	It creates or opens an output file with a deterministic
/*	temporary pathname, obtained by appending the suffix defined
/*	with EDIT_FILE_SUFFIX to the specified original file pathname.
/*	The original file itself is not opened.  edit_file_open()
/*	then locks the output file for exclusive access, and verifies
/*	that the file still exists under the temporary pathname.
/*	At this point in the protocol, the current process controls
/*	both the output file content and its temporary pathname.
/*
/*	In the second phase, the application opens the original
/*	file if needed, and updates the output file via the
/*	\fBtmp_fp\fR member of the EDIT_FILE data structure.  This
/*	phase is not implemented by the edit_file() module.
/*
/*	edit_file_close() implements the third and final phase of
/*	the protocol.  It flushes the output file to persistent
/*	storage, and renames the output file from its temporary
/*	pathname into the place of the original file. When any of
/*	these operations fails, edit_file_close() behaves as if
/*	edit_file_cleanup() was called. Regardless of whether these
/*	operations suceed, edit_file_close() releases the exclusive
/*	lock, closes the output file, and frees up memory that was
/*	allocated by edit_file_open().
/*
/*	edit_file_cleanup() aborts the protocol. It discards the
/*	output file, releases the exclusive lock, closes the output
/*	file, and frees up memory that was allocated by edit_file_open().
/*
/*	Arguments:
/* .IP original_path
/*	The pathname of the original file that will be replaced by
/*	the output file. The temporary pathname for the output file
/*	is obtained by appending the suffix defined with EDIT_FILE_SUFFIX
/*	to a copy of the specified original file pathname, and is
/*	made available via the \fBtmp_path\fR member of the EDIT_FILE
/*	data structure.
/* .IP output_flags
/*	Flags for opening the output file. These are as with open(2),
/*	except that the O_TRUNC flag is ignored.  edit_file_open()
/*	always truncates the output file after it has obtained
/*	exclusive control over the output file content and temporary
/*	pathname.
/* .IP output_mode
/*	Permissions for the output file. These are as with open(2),
/*	except that the output file is initially created with no
/*	group or other access permissions. The specified output
/*	file permissions are applied by edit_file_close().
/* .IP edit_file
/*	Pointer to data structure that is returned upon successful
/*	completion by edit_file_open(), and that must be passed to
/*	edit_file_close() or edit_file_cleanup().
/* DIAGNOSTICS
/*	Fatal errors: memory allocation failure, fstat() failure,
/*	unlink() failure, lock failure, ftruncate() failure.
/*
/*	edit_file_open() immediately returns a null pointer when
/*	it cannot open the output file.
/*
/*	edit_file_close() returns zero on success, VSTREAM_EOF on
/*	failure.
/*
/*	With both functions, the global errno variable indicates
/*	the nature of the problem.  All errors are relative to the
/*	temporary output's pathname. With both functions, this
/*	pathname is not available via the EDIT_FILE data structure,
/*	because that structure was already destroyed, or not created.
/* BUGS
/*	In the non-error case, edit_file_open() will not return
/*	until it obtains exclusive control over the output file
/*	content and temporary pathname.  Applications that are
/*	concerned about deadlock should protect the edit_file_open()
/*	call with a watchdog timer.
/*
/*	When interrupted, edit_file_close() may leave behind a
/*	world-readable output file under the temporary pathname.
/*	On some systems this can be used to inflict a shared-lock
/*	DOS on the protocol.  Applications that are concerned about
/*	maximal safety should protect the edit_file_close() call
/*	with sigdelay() and sigresume() calls, but this introduces
/*	the risk that the program will get stuck forever.
