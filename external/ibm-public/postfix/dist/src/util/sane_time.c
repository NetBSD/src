/* NAME
/*	sane_time 3
/* SUMMARY
/*	time(2) with backward time jump protection.
/* SYNOPSIS
/*	#include <sane_time.h>
/*
/*	time_t sane_time(void)
/*
/* DESCRIPTION
/*	This module provides time(2) like call for applications
/*	which need monotonically increasing time function rather
/*	than the real exact time. It eliminates the need for various
/*	workarounds all over the application which would handle
/*	potential problems if time suddenly jumps backward.
/*	Instead we choose to deal with this problem inside this
/*	module and let the application focus on its own tasks.
/*
/*	sane_time() returns the current timestamp as obtained from
/*	time(2) call, at least most of the time. In case this routine
/*	detects that time has jumped backward, it keeps returning
/*	whatever timestamp it returned before, until this timestamp
/*	and the time(2) timestamp become synchronized again.
/*	Additionally, the returned timestamp is slowly increased to
/*	prevent the faked clock from freezing for too long.
/* SEE ALSO
/*	time(2) get current time
/* DIAGNOSTICS
/*	Warning message is logged if backward time jump is detected.
/* LICENSE
/* .ad
