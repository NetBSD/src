/* NAME
/*	deliver_include 3
/* SUMMARY
/*	deliver to addresses listed in include file
/* SYNOPSIS
/*	#include "local.h"
/*
/*	int	deliver_include(state, usr_attr, path)
/*	LOCAL_STATE state;
/*	USER_ATTR usr_attr;
/*	char	*path;
/* DESCRIPTION
/*	deliver_include() processes the contents of the named include
/*	file and delivers to each address listed. Some sanity checks
/*	are done on the include file permissions and type.
/*
/*	Arguments:
/* .IP state
/*	The attributes that specify the message, recipient and more.
/*	Attributes describing alias, include, or forward expansion.
/*	A table with the results from expanding aliases or lists.
/*	A table with delivered-to: addresses taken from the message.
/* .IP usr_attr
/*	Attributes describing user rights and environment.
/* .IP path
/*	Pathname of the include file.
/* DIAGNOSTICS
/*	Fatal errors: out of memory. Warnings: bad include file type
/*	or permissions. The result is non-zero when delivery should be
/*	tried again.
/* SEE ALSO
/*	token(3) tokenize list
/* LICENSE
