/* NAME
/*	local 8
/* SUMMARY
/*	Postfix local mail delivery
/* SYNOPSIS
/*	\fBlocal\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
/* DESCRIPTION
/*	The \fBlocal\fR(8) daemon processes delivery requests from the
/*	Postfix queue manager to deliver mail to local recipients.
/*	Each delivery request specifies a queue file, a sender address,
/*	a domain or host to deliver to, and one or more recipients.
/*	This program expects to be run from the \fBmaster\fR(8) process
/*	manager.
/*
/*	The \fBlocal\fR(8) daemon updates queue files and marks recipients
/*	as finished, or it informs the queue manager that delivery should
/*	be tried again at a later time. Delivery status reports are sent
/*	to the \fBbounce\fR(8), \fBdefer\fR(8) or \fBtrace\fR(8) daemon as
/*	appropriate.
/* CASE FOLDING
/* .ad
/* .fi
/*	All delivery decisions are made using the bare recipient
/*	name (i.e. the address localpart), folded to lower case.
/*	See also under ADDRESS EXTENSION below for a few exceptions.
/* SYSTEM-WIDE AND USER-LEVEL ALIASING
/* .ad
/* .fi
/*	The system administrator can set up one or more system-wide
/*	\fBsendmail\fR-style alias databases.
/*	Users can have \fBsendmail\fR-style ~/.\fBforward\fR files.
/*	Mail for \fIname\fR is delivered to the alias \fIname\fR, to
/*	destinations in ~\fIname\fR/.\fBforward\fR, to the mailbox owned
/*	by the user \fIname\fR, or it is sent back as undeliverable.
/*
/*	The system administrator can specify a comma/space separated list
/*	of ~\fR/.\fBforward\fR like files through the \fBforward_path\fR
/*	configuration parameter. Upon delivery, the local delivery agent
/*	tries each pathname in the list until a file is found.
/*
/*	Delivery via ~/.\fBforward\fR files is done with the privileges
/*	of the recipient.
/*	Thus, ~/.\fBforward\fR like files must be readable by the
/*	recipient, and their parent directory needs to have "execute"
/*	permission for the recipient.
/*
/*	The \fBforward_path\fR parameter is subject to interpolation of
/*	\fB$user\fR (recipient username), \fB$home\fR (recipient home
/*	directory), \fB$shell\fR (recipient shell), \fB$recipient\fR
/*	(complete recipient address), \fB$extension\fR (recipient address
/*	extension), \fB$domain\fR (recipient domain), \fB$local\fR
/*	(entire recipient address localpart) and
/*	\fB$recipient_delimiter.\fR The forms \fI${name?value}\fR and
/*	\fI${name:value}\fR expand conditionally to \fIvalue\fR when
/*	\fI$name\fR is (is not) defined.
/*	Characters that may have special meaning to the shell or file system
/*	are replaced by underscores.  The list of acceptable characters
/*	is specified with the \fBforward_expansion_filter\fR configuration
/*	parameter.
/*
/*	An alias or ~/.\fBforward\fR file may list any combination of external
/*	commands, destination file names, \fB:include:\fR directives, or
/*	mail addresses.
/*	See \fBaliases\fR(5) for a precise description. Each line in a
/*	user's .\fBforward\fR file has the same syntax as the right-hand part
/*	of an alias.
/*
/*	When an address is found in its own alias expansion, delivery is
/*	made to the user instead. When a user is listed in the user's own
/*	~/.\fBforward\fR file, delivery is made to the user's mailbox instead.
/*	An empty ~/.\fBforward\fR file means do not forward mail.
/*
/*	In order to prevent the mail system from using up unreasonable
/*	amounts of memory, input records read from \fB:include:\fR or from
/*	~/.\fBforward\fR files are broken up into chunks of length
/*	\fBline_length_limit\fR.
/*
/*	While expanding aliases, ~/.\fBforward\fR files, and so on, the
/*	program attempts to avoid duplicate deliveries. The
/*	\fBduplicate_filter_limit\fR configuration parameter limits the
/*	number of remembered recipients.
/* MAIL FORWARDING
/* .ad
/* .fi
/*	For the sake of reliability, forwarded mail is re-submitted as
/*	a new message, so that each recipient has a separate on-file
/*	delivery status record.
/*
/*	In order to stop mail forwarding loops early, the software adds an
/*	optional
/*	\fBDelivered-To:\fR header with the final envelope recipient address. If
/*	mail arrives for a recipient that is already listed in a
/*	\fBDelivered-To:\fR header, the message is bounced.
/* MAILBOX DELIVERY
/* .ad
/* .fi
/*	The default per-user mailbox is a file in the UNIX mail spool
/*	directory (\fB/var/mail/\fIuser\fR or \fB/var/spool/mail/\fIuser\fR);
/*	the location can be specified with the \fBmail_spool_directory\fR
/*	configuration parameter. Specify a name ending in \fB/\fR for
/*	\fBqmail\fR-compatible \fBmaildir\fR delivery.
/*
/*	Alternatively, the per-user mailbox can be a file in the user's home
/*	directory with a name specified via the \fBhome_mailbox\fR
/*	configuration parameter. Specify a relative path name. Specify a name
/*	ending in \fB/\fR for \fBqmail\fR-compatible \fBmaildir\fR delivery.
/*
/*	Mailbox delivery can be delegated to an external command specified
/*	with the \fBmailbox_command_maps\fR and \fBmailbox_command\fR
/*	configuration parameters. The command
/*	executes with the privileges of the recipient user (exceptions:
/*	secondary groups are not enabled; in case of delivery as root,
/*	the command executes with the privileges of \fBdefault_privs\fR).
/*
/*	Mailbox delivery can be delegated to alternative message transports
/*	specified in the \fBmaster.cf\fR file.
/*	The \fBmailbox_transport_maps\fR and \fBmailbox_transport\fR
/*	configuration parameters specify an optional
/*	message transport that is to be used for all local recipients,
/*	regardless of whether they are found in the UNIX passwd database.
/*	The \fBfallback_transport_maps\fR and
/*	\fBfallback_transport\fR parameters specify an optional
/*	message transport
/*	for recipients that are not found in the aliases(5) or UNIX
/*	passwd database.
/*
/*	In the case of UNIX-style mailbox delivery,
/*	the \fBlocal\fR(8) daemon prepends a "\fBFrom \fIsender time_stamp\fR"
/*	envelope header to each message, prepends an
/*	\fBX-Original-To:\fR header with the recipient address as given to
/*	Postfix, prepends an
/*	optional \fBDelivered-To:\fR header
/*	with the final envelope recipient address, prepends a \fBReturn-Path:\fR
/*	header with the envelope sender address, prepends a \fB>\fR character
/*	to lines beginning with "\fBFrom \fR", and appends an empty line.
/*	The mailbox is locked for exclusive access while delivery is in
/*	progress. In case of problems, an attempt is made to truncate the
/*	mailbox to its original length.
/*
/*	In the case of \fBmaildir\fR delivery, the local daemon prepends
/*	an optional
/*	\fBDelivered-To:\fR header with the final envelope recipient address,
/*	prepends an
/*	\fBX-Original-To:\fR header with the recipient address as given to
/*	Postfix,
/*	and prepends a \fBReturn-Path:\fR header with the envelope sender
/*	address.
/* EXTERNAL COMMAND DELIVERY
/* .ad
/* .fi
/*	The \fBallow_mail_to_commands\fR configuration parameter restricts
/*	delivery to external commands. The default setting (\fBalias,
/*	forward\fR) forbids command destinations in \fB:include:\fR files.
/*
/*	Optionally, the process working directory is changed to the path
/*	specified with \fBcommand_execution_directory\fR (Postfix 2.2 and
/*	later). Failure to change directory causes mail to be deferred.
/*
/*	The \fBcommand_execution_directory\fR parameter value is subject
/*	to interpolation of \fB$user\fR (recipient username),
/*	\fB$home\fR (recipient home directory), \fB$shell\fR
/*	(recipient shell), \fB$recipient\fR (complete recipient
/*	address), \fB$extension\fR (recipient address extension),
/*	\fB$domain\fR (recipient domain), \fB$local\fR (entire
/*	recipient address localpart) and \fB$recipient_delimiter.\fR
/*	The forms \fI${name?value}\fR and \fI${name:value}\fR expand
/*	conditionally to \fIvalue\fR when \fI$name\fR is (is not)
/*	defined.  Characters that may have special meaning to the
/*	shell or file system are replaced by underscores.  The list
/*	of acceptable characters is specified with the
/*	\fBexecution_directory_expansion_filter\fR configuration
/*	parameter.
/*
/*	The command is executed directly where possible. Assistance by the
/*	shell (\fB/bin/sh\fR on UNIX systems) is used only when the command
/*	contains shell magic characters, or when the command invokes a shell
/*	built-in command.
/*
/*	A limited amount of command output (standard output and standard
/*	error) is captured for inclusion with non-delivery status reports.
/*	A command is forcibly terminated if it does not complete within
/*	\fBcommand_time_limit\fR seconds.  Command exit status codes are
/*	expected to follow the conventions defined in <\fBsysexits.h\fR>.
/*	Exit status 0 means normal successful completion.
/*
/*	Postfix version 2.3 and later support RFC 3463-style enhanced
/*	status codes.  If a command terminates with a non-zero exit
/*	status, and the command output begins with an enhanced
/*	status code, this status code takes precedence over the
/*	non-zero exit status.
/*
/*	A limited amount of message context is exported via environment
/*	variables. Characters that may have special meaning to the shell
/*	are replaced by underscores.  The list of acceptable characters
/*	is specified with the \fBcommand_expansion_filter\fR configuration
/*	parameter.
/* .IP \fBSHELL\fR
/*	The recipient user's login shell.
/* .IP \fBHOME\fR
/*	The recipient user's home directory.

/*	rightmost @ character).
/* .IP \fBORIGINAL_RECIPIENT\fR
/*	The entire recipient address, before any address rewriting
/*	or aliasing (Postfix 2.5 and later).
/* .IP \fBRECIPIENT\fR
/*	The entire recipient address.
/* .IP \fBSENDER\fR
/*	The entire sender address.
/* .PP
/*	Additional remote client information is made available via
/*	the following environment variables:

/* .PP
/*	The \fBPATH\fR environment variable is always reset to a
/*	system-dependent default path, and environment variables
/*	whose names are blessed by the \fBexport_environment\fR
/*	configuration parameter are exported unchanged.
/*
/*	The current working directory is the mail queue directory.
/*
/*	The \fBlocal\fR(8) daemon prepends a "\fBFrom \fIsender time_stamp\fR"
/*	envelope header to each message, prepends an
/*	\fBX-Original-To:\fR header with the recipient address as given to
/*	Postfix, prepends an
/*	optional \fBDelivered-To:\fR
/*	header with the final recipient envelope address, prepends a
/*	\fBReturn-Path:\fR header with the sender envelope address,
/*	and appends no empty line.
/* EXTERNAL FILE DELIVERY
/* .ad
/* .fi
/*	The delivery format depends on the destination filename syntax.
/*	The default is to use UNIX-style mailbox format.  Specify a name
/*	ending in \fB/\fR for \fBqmail\fR-compatible \fBmaildir\fR delivery.
/*
/*	The \fBallow_mail_to_files\fR configuration parameter restricts
/*	delivery to external files. The default setting (\fBalias,
/*	forward\fR) forbids file destinations in \fB:include:\fR files.
/*
/*	In the case of UNIX-style mailbox delivery,
/*	the \fBlocal\fR(8) daemon prepends a "\fBFrom \fIsender time_stamp\fR"
/*	envelope header to each message, prepends an
/*	\fBX-Original-To:\fR header with the recipient address as given to
/*	Postfix, prepends an
/*	optional \fBDelivered-To:\fR
/*	header with the final recipient envelope address, prepends a \fB>\fR
/*	character to lines beginning with "\fBFrom \fR", and appends an
/*	empty line.
/*	The envelope sender address is available in the \fBReturn-Path:\fR
/*	header.
/*	When the destination is a regular file, it is locked for exclusive
/*	access while delivery is in progress. In case of problems, an attempt
/*	is made to truncate a regular file to its original length.
/*
/*	In the case of \fBmaildir\fR delivery, the local daemon prepends
/*	an optional
/*	\fBDelivered-To:\fR header with the final envelope recipient address,
/*	and prepends an
/*	\fBX-Original-To:\fR header with the recipient address as given to
/*	Postfix.
/*	The envelope sender address is available in the \fBReturn-Path:\fR
/*	header.
/* ADDRESS EXTENSION
/* .ad
/* .fi
/*	The optional \fBrecipient_delimiter\fR configuration parameter
/*	specifies how to separate address extensions from local recipient
/*	names.
/*
/*	For example, with "\fBrecipient_delimiter = +\fR", mail for
/*	\fIname\fR+\fIfoo\fR is delivered to the alias \fIname\fR+\fIfoo\fR
/*	or to the alias \fIname\fR, to the destinations listed in
/*	~\fIname\fR/.\fBforward\fR+\fIfoo\fR or in ~\fIname\fR/.\fBforward\fR,
/*	to the mailbox owned by the user \fIname\fR, or it is sent back as
/*	undeliverable.
/* DELIVERY RIGHTS
/* .ad
/* .fi
/*	Deliveries to external files and external commands are made with
/*	the rights of the receiving user on whose behalf the delivery is made.
/*	In the absence of a user context, the \fBlocal\fR(8) daemon uses the
/*	owner rights of the \fB:include:\fR file or alias database.
/*	When those files are owned by the superuser, delivery is made with
/*	the rights specified with the \fBdefault_privs\fR configuration
/*	parameter.
/* STANDARDS
/*	RFC 822 (ARPA Internet Text Messages)
/*	RFC 3463 (Enhanced status codes)
/* DIAGNOSTICS
/*	Problems and transactions are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8).
/*	Corrupted message files are marked so that the queue
/*	manager can move them to the \fBcorrupt\fR queue afterwards.
/*
/*	Depending on the setting of the \fBnotify_classes\fR parameter,
/*	the postmaster is notified of bounces and of other trouble.
/* SECURITY
/* .ad
/* .fi
/*	The \fBlocal\fR(8) delivery agent needs a dual personality
/*	1) to access the private Postfix queue and IPC mechanisms,
/*	2) to impersonate the recipient and deliver to recipient-specified
/*	files or commands. It is therefore security sensitive.
/*
/*	The \fBlocal\fR(8) delivery agent disallows regular expression
/*	substitution of $1 etc. in \fBalias_maps\fR, because that
/*	would open a security hole.
/*
/*	The \fBlocal\fR(8) delivery agent will silently ignore
/*	requests to use the \fBproxymap\fR(8) server within
/*	\fBalias_maps\fR. Instead it will open the table directly.
/*	Before Postfix version 2.2, the \fBlocal\fR(8) delivery
/*	agent will terminate with a fatal error.
/* BUGS
/*	For security reasons, the message delivery status of external commands
/*	or of external files is never checkpointed to file. As a result,
/*	the program may occasionally deliver more than once to a command or
/*	external file. Better safe than sorry.
/*
/*	Mutually-recursive aliases or ~/.\fBforward\fR files are not detected
/*	early.  The resulting mail forwarding loop is broken by the use of the
/*	\fBDelivered-To:\fR message header.
/* CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
