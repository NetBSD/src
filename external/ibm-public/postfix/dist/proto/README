This directory contains source for manual pages that aren't generated
from C source code comments, and for README files.

Tools for these conversions are found in the ../mantools subdirectory.
The most important tool is postlink, which adds all the hyperlinks
between manual pages, configuration parameters and README files.

Manual pages are in the form of "shell" style comments.  They are
converted into nroff(1) input with the srctoman utility, converted
to HTML with man2html, and hyperlinked with postlink.

The README files are in the form of HTML. The are converted into
hyperlinked HTML with postlink, and are converted into ASCII files
with html2readme.

The format of the README source files is a little tricky, because
of the way postlink works.

- postlink hyperlinks all the references to Postfix manual pages,
configuration parameters, README file names, RFC documents, Postfix
address class names, and URLs.  Therefore you should not hyperlink
those elements yourself.

- URLs (such as "http://www.example.com") cannot contain quote, comma,
or space characters. 

- An URL that appears at the end of a line must be followed by one
other character.

- Text must go between <p> and </p>, especially within lists, for
consistency of vertical space.

- Code fragments must go between <pre> and </pre>, again for
consistency of vertical space.
