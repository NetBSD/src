<h2>Purpose of this document </h2>

<p> This document is an introduction to Postfix queue congestion analysis.
It explains how the qshape(1) program can help to track down the
reason for queue congestion.  qshape(1) is bundled with Postfix
2.1 and later source code, under the "auxiliary" directory. This
document describes qshape(1) as bundled with Postfix 2.4.  </p>

<h2><a name="qshape">Introducing the qshape tool</a></h2>

<p> When mail is draining slowly or the queue is unexpectedly large,
run qshape(1) as the super-user (root) to help zero in on the problem.
The qshape(1) program displays a tabular view of the Postfix queue
contents.  </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> On the horizontal axis, it displays the queue age with
fine granularity for recent messages and (geometrically) less fine
granularity for older messages.  </p>

<li> <p> The vertical axis displays the destination (or with the
"-s" switch the sender) domain. Domains with the most messages are
listed first. </p>

</ul>

<p> For example, in the output below we see the top 10 lines of
the (mostly forged) sender domain distribution for captured spam
in the "hold" queue: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>

</blockquote>

<ul>

<li> <p> The "T" column shows the total (in this case sender) count
for each domain.  The columns with numbers above them, show counts
for messages aged fewer than that many minutes, but not younger
than the age limit for the previous column.  The row labeled "TOTAL"
shows the total count for all domains. </p>

<li> <p> In this example, there are 14 messages allegedly from
yahoo.com, 1 between 10 and 20 minutes old, 1 between 320 and 640
minutes old and 12 older than 1280 minutes (1440 minutes in a day).
</p>

</ul>

<p> When the output is a terminal intermediate results showing the top 20
domains (-n option) are displayed after every 1000 messages (-N option)
and the final output also shows only the top 20 domains. This makes
qshape useful even when the deferred queue is very large and it may
otherwise take prohibitively long to read the entire deferred queue. </p>

<p> By default, qshape shows statistics for the union of both the
incoming and active queues which are the most relevant queues to
look at when analyzing performance. </p>

<p> One can request an alternate list of queues: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
$ qshape deferred
$ qshape incoming active deferred
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> this will show the age distribution of the deferred queue or
the union of the incoming active and deferred queues. </p>

<p> Command line options control the number of display "buckets",
the age limit for the smallest bucket, display of parent domain
counts and so on. The "-h" option outputs a summary of the available
switches. </p>

<h2><a name="trouble_shooting">Trouble shooting with qshape</a>
</h2>

<p> Large numbers in the qshape output represent a large number of
messages that are destined to (or alleged to come from) a particular
domain.  It should be possible to tell at a glance which domains
dominate the queue sender or recipient counts, approximately when
a burst of mail started, and when it stopped. </p>

<p> The problem destinations or sender domains appear near the top
left corner of the output table. Remember that the active queue
can accommodate up to 20000 ($qmgr_message_active_limit) messages.
To check whether this limit has been reached, use: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
$ qshape -s active       <i>(show sender statistics)</i>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> If the total sender count is below 20000 the active queue is
not yet saturated, any high volume sender domains show near the
top of the output.

<p> With oqmgr(8) the active queue is also limited to at most 20000
recipient addresses ($qmgr_message_recipient_limit). To check for
exhaustion of this limit use: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
$ qshape active          <i>(show recipient statistics)</i>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> Having found the high volume domains, it is often useful to
search the logs for recent messages pertaining to the domains in
question. </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
# Find deliveries to example.com
#
$ tail -10000 /var/log/maillog |
        egrep -i ': to=&lt;.*@example\.com&gt;,' |
        less

# Find messages from example.com
#
$ tail -10000 /var/log/maillog |
        egrep -i ': from=&lt;.*@example\.com&gt;,' |
        less
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> You may want to drill in on some specific queue ids: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
# Find all messages for a specific queue id.
#
$ tail -10000 /var/log/maillog | egrep ': 2B2173FF68: '
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> Also look for queue manager warning messages in the log. These
warnings can suggest strategies to reduce congestion. </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
$ egrep 'qmgr.*(panic|fatal|error|warning):' /var/log/maillog
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> When all else fails try the Postfix mailing list for help, but
please don't forget to include the top 10 or 20 lines of qshape(1)
output.  </p>

<h2><a name="healthy">Example 1: Healthy queue</a></h2>

<p> When looking at just the incoming and active queues, under
normal conditions (no congestion) the incoming and active queues
are nearly empty. Mail leaves the system almost as quickly as it
comes in or is deferred without congestion in the active queue.
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
$ qshape        <i>(show incoming and active queue status)</i>

                 T  5 10 20 40 80 160 320 640 1280 1280+

</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> If one looks at the two queues separately, the incoming queue
is empty or perhaps briefly has one or two messages, while the
active queue holds more messages and for a somewhat longer time:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
$ qshape incoming

                 T  5 10 20 40 80 160 320 640 1280 1280+

<h2><a name="dictionary_bounce">Example 2: Deferred queue full of
dictionary attack bounces</a></h2>

<p> This is from a server where recipient validation is not yet
available for some of the hosted domains. Dictionary attacks on
the unvalidated domains result in bounce backscatter. The bounces
dominate the queue, but with proper tuning they do not saturate the
incoming or active queues. The high volume of deferred mail is not
a direct cause for alarm. </p>

<p> The domains shown are mostly bulk-mailers and all the volume
is the tail end of the time distribution, showing that short term
arrival rates are moderate. Larger numbers and lower message ages
are more indicative of current trouble. Old mail still going nowhere
is largely harmless so long as the active and incoming queues are
short. We can also see that the groups.msn.com undeliverables are
low rate steady stream rather than a concentrated dictionary attack
that is now over. </p>

<p> Looking at the sender distribution, we see that as expected
most of the messages are bounces. </p>

<h2><a name="active_congestion">Example 3: Congestion in the active
queue</a></h2>

<p> This example is taken from a Feb 2004 discussion on the Postfix
Users list.  Congestion was reported with the active and incoming
queues large and not shrinking despite very large delivery agent
process limits.  The thread is archived at:
http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=c0b7js$2r65$1@FreeBSD.csie.NCTU.edu.tw
and
http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/postfix/2004-02/thread.html#1371
</p>

<p> Using an older version of qshape(1) it was quickly determined
that all the messages were for just a few destinations: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
$ qshape        <i>(show incoming and active queue status)</i>

                           T   A   5  10  20  40  80 160 320 320+
                 TOTAL 11775 9996  0   0   1   1  42  94 221 1420
  user.sourceforge.net  7678 7678  0   0   0   0   0   0   0    0
 lists.sourceforge.net  2313 2313  0   0   0   0   0   0   0    0
        gzd.gotdns.com   102    0  0   0   0   0   0   0   2  100
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> The "A" column showed the count of messages in the active queue,
and the numbered columns showed totals for the deferred queue. At
10000 messages (Postfix 1.x active queue size limit) the active
queue is full. The incoming was growing rapidly. </p>

<p> With the trouble destinations clearly identified, the administrator
quickly found and fixed the problem. It is substantially harder to
glean the same information from the logs. While a careful reading
of mailq(1) output should yield similar results, it is much harder
to gauge the magnitude of the problem by looking at the queue
one message at a time. </p>

<h2><a name="backlog">Example 4: High volume destination backlog</a></h2>

<p> When a site you send a lot of email to is down or slow, mail
messages will rapidly build up in the deferred queue, or worse, in
the active queue. The qshape output will show large numbers for
the destination domain in all age buckets that overlap the starting
time of the problem: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
$ qshape deferred | head

                    T   5  10  20  40   80  160 320 640 1280 1280+

             ...
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> Here the "highvolume.com" destination is continuing to accumulate
deferred mail. The incoming and active queues are fine, but the
deferred queue started growing some time between 1 and 2 hours ago
and continues to grow. </p>

<p> If the high volume destination is not down, but is instead
slow, one might see similar congestion in the active queue. Active
queue congestion is a greater cause for alarm; one might need to
take measures to ensure that the mail is deferred instead or even
add an access(5) rule asking the sender to try again later. </p>

<p> If a high volume destination exhibits frequent bursts of consecutive
connections refused by all MX hosts or "421 Server busy errors", it
is possible for the queue manager to mark the destination as "dead"
despite the transient nature of the errors. The destination will be
retried again after the expiration of a $minimal_backoff_time timer.
If the error bursts are frequent enough it may be that only a small
quantity of email is delivered before the destination is again marked
"dead". In some cases enabling static (not on demand) connection
caching by listing the appropriate nexthop domain in a table included in
"smtp_connection_cache_destinations" may help to reduce the error rate,
because most messages will re-use existing connections. </p>

<p> The MTA that has been observed most frequently to exhibit such
bursts of errors is Microsoft Exchange, which refuses connections
under load. Some proxy virus scanners in front of the Exchange
server propagate the refused connection to the client as a "421"
error. </p>

<p> Note that it is now possible to configure Postfix to exhibit similarly
erratic behavior by misconfiguring the anvil(8) service.  Do not use
anvil(8) for steady-state rate limiting, its purpose is (unintentional)
DoS prevention and the rate limits set should be very generous! </p>

<p> If one finds oneself needing to deliver a high volume of mail to a
destination that exhibits frequent brief bursts of errors and connection
caching does not solve the problem, there is a subtle workaround. </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Postfix version 2.5 and later: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> In master.cf set up a dedicated clone of the "smtp" transport
for the destination in question. In the example below we will call
it "fragile". </p>

<li> <p> In master.cf configure a reasonable process limit for the
cloned smtp transport (a number in the 10-20 range is typical). </p>

<li> <p> IMPORTANT!!! In main.cf configure a large per-destination
pseudo-cohort failure limit for the cloned smtp transport. </p>

<pre>
/etc/postfix/main.cf:
    transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport
    fragile_destination_concurrency_failed_cohort_limit = 100
    fragile_destination_concurrency_limit = 20

/etc/postfix/transport:
    example.com  fragile:

/etc/postfix/master.cf:
    # service type  private unpriv  chroot  wakeup  maxproc command
    fragile   unix     -       -       n       -      20    smtp
</pre>

<p> See also the documentation for
default_destination_concurrency_failed_cohort_limit and
default_destination_concurrency_limit. </p>

</ul>

<li> <p> Earlier Postfix versions: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> In master.cf set up a dedicated clone of the "smtp"
transport for the destination in question. In the example below
we will call it "fragile". </p>

<li> <p> In master.cf configure a reasonable process limit for the
transport (a number in the 10-20 range is typical). </p>

<li> <p> IMPORTANT!!! In main.cf configure a very large initial
and destination concurrency limit for this transport (say 2000). </p>

<pre>
/etc/postfix/main.cf:
    transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport
    initial_destination_concurrency = 2000
    fragile_destination_concurrency_limit = 2000

/etc/postfix/transport:
    example.com  fragile:

/etc/postfix/master.cf:
    # service type  private unpriv  chroot  wakeup  maxproc command
    fragile   unix     -       -       n       -      20    smtp
</pre>

<p> See also the documentation for default_destination_concurrency_limit.
</p>

</ul>

</ul>

<p> The effect of this configuration is that up to 2000
consecutive errors are tolerated without marking the destination
dead, while the total concurrency remains reasonable (10-20
processes). This trick is only for a very specialized situation:
high volume delivery into a channel with multi-error bursts
that is capable of high throughput, but is repeatedly throttled by
the bursts of errors. </p>

<p> When a destination is unable to handle the load even after the
Postfix process limit is reduced to 1, a desperate measure is to
insert brief delays between delivery attempts. </p>

<ul> 

<li> <p> Postfix version 2.5 and later: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> In master.cf set up a dedicated clone of the "smtp" transport
for the problem destination. In the example below we call it "slow".
</p>

<li> <p> In main.cf configure a short delay between deliveries to
the same destination.  </p>

<pre>
/etc/postfix/main.cf:
    transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport
    slow_destination_rate_delay = 1
    slow_destination_concurrency_failed_cohort_limit = 100

/etc/postfix/transport:
    example.com  slow:

/etc/postfix/master.cf:
    # service type  private unpriv  chroot  wakeup  maxproc command
    slow      unix     -       -       n       -       -    smtp
</pre>

</ul>

<p> See also the documentation for default_destination_rate_delay. </p>

<p> This solution forces the Postfix smtp(8) client to wait for
$slow_destination_rate_delay seconds between deliveries to the same
destination.  </p>

<p> IMPORTANT!! The large slow_destination_concurrency_failed_cohort_limit
value is needed. This prevents Postfix from deferring all mail for
the same destination after only one connection or handshake error
(the reason for this is that non-zero slow_destination_rate_delay
forces a per-destination concurrency of 1).  </p>

<li> <p> Earlier Postfix versions: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p>  In the transport map entry for the problem destination,
specify a dead host as the primary nexthop. </p>

<li> <p> In the master.cf entry for the transport specify the
problem destination as the fallback_relay and specify a small
smtp_connect_timeout value. </p>

<pre>
/etc/postfix/main.cf:
    transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport

/etc/postfix/transport:
    example.com  slow:[dead.host]

/etc/postfix/master.cf:
    # service type  private unpriv  chroot  wakeup  maxproc command
    slow      unix     -       -       n       -       1    smtp
        -o fallback_relay=problem.example.com
        -o smtp_connect_timeout=1
        -o smtp_connection_cache_on_demand=no
</pre>

</ul>

<p> This solution forces the Postfix smtp(8) client to wait for
$smtp_connect_timeout seconds between deliveries. The connection
caching feature is disabled to prevent the client from skipping
over the dead host.  </p>

</ul>

<h2><a name="queues">Postfix queue directories</a></h2>

<p> The following sections describe Postfix queues: their purpose,
what normal behavior looks like, and how to diagnose abnormal
behavior. </p>

<h3> <a name="maildrop_queue"> The "maildrop" queue </a> </h3>

<p> Messages that have been submitted via the Postfix sendmail(1)
command, but not yet brought into the main Postfix queue by the
pickup(8) service, await processing in the "maildrop" queue. Messages
can be added to the "maildrop" queue even when the Postfix system
is not running. They will begin to be processed once Postfix is
started.  </p>

<p> The "maildrop" queue is drained by the single threaded pickup(8)
service scanning the queue directory periodically or when notified
of new message arrival by the postdrop(1) program. The postdrop(1)
program is a setgid helper that allows the unprivileged Postfix
sendmail(1) program to inject mail into the "maildrop" queue and
to notify the pickup(8) service of its arrival. </p>

<p> All mail that enters the main Postfix queue does so via the
cleanup(8) service. The cleanup service is responsible for envelope
and header rewriting, header and body regular expression checks,
automatic bcc recipient processing, milter content processing, and
reliable insertion of the message into the Postfix "incoming" queue. </p>

<p> In the absence of excessive CPU consumption in cleanup(8) header
or body regular expression checks or other software consuming all
available CPU resources, Postfix performance is disk I/O bound.
The rate at which the pickup(8) service can inject messages into
the queue is largely determined by disk access times, since the
cleanup(8) service must commit the message to stable storage before
returning success. The same is true of the postdrop(1) program
writing the message to the "maildrop" directory. </p>

<p> As the pickup service is single threaded, it can only deliver
one message at a time at a rate that does not exceed the reciprocal
disk I/O latency (+ CPU if not negligible) of the cleanup service.
</p>

<p> Congestion in this queue is indicative of an excessive local message
submission rate or perhaps excessive CPU consumption in the cleanup(8)
service due to excessive body_checks, or (Postfix &ge; 2.3) high latency
milters. </p>

<p> Note, that once the active queue is full, the cleanup service
will attempt to slow down message injection by pausing $in_flow_delay
for each message. In this case "maildrop" queue congestion may be
a consequence of congestion downstream, rather than a problem in
its own right. </p>

<p> Note, you should not attempt to deliver large volumes of mail via
the pickup(8) service. High volume sites should avoid using "simple"
content filters that re-inject scanned mail via Postfix sendmail(1)
and postdrop(1). </p>

<p> A high arrival rate of locally submitted mail may be an indication
of an uncaught forwarding loop, or a run-away notification program.
Try to keep the volume of local mail injection to a moderate level.
</p>

<p> The "postsuper -r" command can place selected messages into
the "maildrop" queue for reprocessing. This is most useful for
resetting any stale content_filter settings. Requeuing a large number
of messages using "postsuper -r" can clearly cause a spike in the
size of the "maildrop" queue. </p>

<h3> <a name="hold_queue"> The "hold" queue </a> </h3>

<p> The administrator can define "smtpd" access(5) policies, or
cleanup(8) header/body checks that cause messages to be automatically
diverted from normal processing and placed indefinitely in the
"hold" queue. Messages placed in the "hold" queue stay there until
the administrator intervenes. No periodic delivery attempts are
made for messages in the "hold" queue. The postsuper(1) command
can be used to manually release messages into the "deferred" queue.
</p>

<p> Messages can potentially stay in the "hold" queue longer than
$maximal_queue_lifetime. If such "old" messages need to be released from
the "hold" queue, they should typically be moved into the "maildrop"
queue using "postsuper -r", so that the message gets a new timestamp and
is given more than one opportunity to be delivered.  Messages that are
"young" can be moved directly into the "deferred" queue using
"postsuper -H". </p>

<p> The "hold" queue plays little role in Postfix performance, and
monitoring of the "hold" queue is typically more closely motivated
by tracking spam and malware, than by performance issues. </p>

<h3> <a name="incoming_queue"> The "incoming" queue </a> </h3>

<p> All new mail entering the Postfix queue is written by the
cleanup(8) service into the "incoming" queue. New queue files are
created owned by the "postfix" user with an access bitmask (or
mode) of 0600. Once a queue file is ready for further processing
the cleanup(8) service changes the queue file mode to 0700 and
notifies the queue manager of new mail arrival. The queue manager
ignores incomplete queue files whose mode is 0600, as these are
still being written by cleanup.  </p>

<p> The queue manager scans the incoming queue bringing any new
mail into the "active" queue if the active queue resource limits
have not been exceeded. By default, the active queue accommodates
at most 20000 messages. Once the active queue message limit is
reached, the queue manager stops scanning the incoming (and deferred,
see below) queue.  </p>

<p> Under normal conditions the incoming queue is nearly empty (has
only mode 0600 files), with the queue manager able to import new
messages into the active queue as soon as they become available.
</p>

<p> The incoming queue grows when the message input rate spikes
above the rate at which the queue manager can import messages into
the active queue. The main factors slowing down the queue manager
are disk I/O and lookup queries to the trivial-rewrite service. If the queue
manager is routinely not keeping up, consider not using "slow"
lookup services (MySQL, LDAP, ...) for transport lookups or speeding
up the hosts that provide the lookup service.  If the problem is I/O
starvation, consider striping the queue over more disks, faster controllers
with a battery write cache, or other hardware improvements. At the very
least, make sure that the queue directory is mounted with the "noatime"
option if applicable to the underlying filesystem. </p>

<p> The in_flow_delay parameter is used to clamp the input rate
when the queue manager starts to fall behind. The cleanup(8) service
will pause for $in_flow_delay seconds before creating a new queue
file if it cannot obtain a "token" from the queue manager.  </p>

<p> Since the number of cleanup(8) processes is limited in most
cases by the SMTP server concurrency, the input rate can exceed
the output rate by at most "SMTP connection count" / $in_flow_delay
messages per second.  </p>

<p> With a default process limit of 100, and an in_flow_delay of
1s, the coupling is strong enough to limit a single run-away injector
to 1 message per second, but is not strong enough to deflect an
excessive input rate from many sources at the same time.  </p>

<p> If a server is being hammered from multiple directions, consider
raising the in_flow_delay to 10 seconds, but only if the incoming
queue is growing even while the active queue is not full and the
trivial-rewrite service is using a fast transport lookup mechanism.
</p>

<h3> <a name="active_queue"> The "active" queue </a> </h3>

<p> The queue manager is a delivery agent scheduler; it works to
ensure fast and fair delivery of mail to all destinations within
designated resource limits.  </p>

<p> The active queue is somewhat analogous to an operating system's
process run queue. Messages in the active queue are ready to be
sent (runnable), but are not necessarily in the process of being
sent (running).  </p>

<p> While most Postfix administrators think of the "active" queue
as a directory on disk, the real "active" queue is a set of data
structures in the memory of the queue manager process.  </p>

<p> Messages in the "maildrop", "hold", "incoming" and "deferred"
queues (see below) do not occupy memory; they are safely stored on
disk waiting for their turn to be processed. The envelope information
for messages in the "active" queue is managed in memory, allowing
the queue manager to do global scheduling, allocating available
delivery agent processes to an appropriate message in the active
queue.  </p>

<p> Within the active queue, (multi-recipient) messages are broken
up into groups of recipients that share the same transport/nexthop
combination; the group size is capped by the transport's recipient
concurrency limit.  </p>

<p> Multiple recipient groups (from one or more messages) are queued
for delivery grouped by transport/nexthop combination. The
<b>destination</b> concurrency limit for the transports caps the number
of simultaneous delivery attempts for each nexthop. Transports with
a <b>recipient</b> concurrency limit of 1 are special: these are grouped
by the actual recipient address rather than the nexthop, yielding
per-recipient concurrency limits rather than per-domain
concurrency limits. Per-recipient limits are appropriate when
performing final delivery to mailboxes rather than when relaying
to a remote server.  </p>

<p> Congestion occurs in the active queue when one or more destinations
drain slower than the corresponding message input rate. </p>

<p> Input into the active queue comes both from new mail in the "incoming"
queue, and retries of mail in the "deferred" queue. Should the "deferred"
queue get really large, retries of old mail can dominate the arrival
rate of new mail. Systems with more CPU, faster disks and more network
bandwidth can deal with larger deferred queues, but as a rule of thumb
the deferred queue scales to somewhere between 100,000 and 1,000,000
messages with good performance unlikely above that "limit". Systems with
queues this large should typically stop accepting new mail, or put the
backlog "on hold" until the underlying issue is fixed (provided that
there is enough capacity to handle just the new mail). </p>

<p> When a destination is down for some time, the queue manager will
mark it dead, and immediately defer all mail for the destination without
trying to assign it to a delivery agent. In this case the messages
will quickly leave the active queue and end up in the deferred queue
(with Postfix &lt; 2.4, this is done directly by the queue manager,
with Postfix &ge; 2.4 this is done via the "retry" delivery agent). </p>

<p> When the destination is instead simply slow, or there is a problem
causing an excessive arrival rate the active queue will grow and will
become dominated by mail to the congested destination.  </p>

<p> The only way to reduce congestion is to either reduce the input
rate or increase the throughput. Increasing the throughput requires
either increasing the concurrency or reducing the latency of
deliveries.  </p>

<p> For high volume sites a key tuning parameter is the number of
"smtp" delivery agents allocated to the "smtp" and "relay" transports.
High volume sites tend to send to many different destinations, many
of which may be down or slow, so a good fraction of the available
delivery agents will be blocked waiting for slow sites. Also mail
destined across the globe will incur large SMTP command-response
latencies, so high message throughput can only be achieved with
more concurrent delivery agents.  </p>

<p> The default "smtp" process limit of 100 is good enough for most
sites, and may even need to be lowered for sites with low bandwidth
connections (no use increasing concurrency once the network pipe
is full). When one finds that the queue is growing on an "idle"
system (CPU, disk I/O and network not exhausted) the remaining
reason for congestion is insufficient concurrency in the face of
a high average latency. If the number of outbound SMTP connections
(either ESTABLISHED or SYN_SENT) reaches the process limit, mail
is draining slowly and the system and network are not loaded, raise
the "smtp" and/or "relay" process limits!  </p>

<p> When a high volume destination is served by multiple MX hosts with
typically low delivery latency, performance can suffer dramatically when
one of the MX hosts is unresponsive and SMTP connections to that host
timeout. For example, if there are 2 equal weight MX hosts, the SMTP
connection timeout is 30 seconds and one of the MX hosts is down, the
average SMTP connection will take approximately 15 seconds to complete.
With a default per-destination concurrency limit of 20 connections,
throughput falls to just over 1 message per second. </p>

<p> The best way to avoid bottlenecks when one or more MX hosts is
non-responsive is to use connection caching. Connection caching was
introduced with Postfix 2.2 and is by default enabled on demand for
destinations with a backlog of mail in the active queue. When connection
caching is in effect for a particular destination, established connections
are re-used to send additional messages, this reduces the number of
connections made per message delivery and maintains good throughput even
in the face of partial unavailability of the destination's MX hosts. </p>

<p> If connection caching is not available (Postfix &lt; 2.2) or does
not provide a sufficient latency reduction, especially for the "relay"
transport used to forward mail to "your own" domains, consider setting
lower than default SMTP connection timeouts (1-5 seconds) and higher
than default destination concurrency limits. This will further reduce
latency and provide more concurrency to maintain throughput should
latency rise. </p>

<p> Setting high concurrency limits to domains that are not your own may
be viewed as hostile by the receiving system, and steps may be taken
to prevent you from monopolizing the destination system's resources.
The defensive measures may substantially reduce your throughput or block
access entirely. Do not set aggressive concurrency limits to remote
domains without coordinating with the administrators of the target
domain. </p>

<p> If necessary, dedicate and tune custom transports for selected high
volume destinations. The "relay" transport is provided for forwarding mail
to domains for which your server is a primary or backup MX host. These can
make up a substantial fraction of your email traffic. Use the "relay" and
not the "smtp" transport to send email to these domains. Using the "relay"
transport allocates a separate delivery agent pool to these destinations
and allows separate tuning of timeouts and concurrency limits. </p>

<p> Another common cause of congestion is unwarranted flushing of the
entire deferred queue. The deferred queue holds messages that are likely
to fail to be delivered and are also likely to be slow to fail delivery
(time out). As a result the most common reaction to a large deferred queue
(flush it!) is more than likely counter-productive, and typically makes
the congestion worse. Do not flush the deferred queue unless you expect
that most of its content has recently become deliverable (e.g. relayhost
back up after an outage)!  </p>

<p> Note that whenever the queue manager is restarted, there may
already be messages in the active queue directory, but the "real"
active queue in memory is empty. In order to recover the in-memory
state, the queue manager moves all the active queue messages
back into the incoming queue, and then uses its normal incoming
queue scan to refill the active queue. The process of moving all
the messages back and forth, redoing transport table (trivial-rewrite(8)
resolve service) lookups, and re-importing the messages back into
memory is expensive. At all costs, avoid frequent restarts of the
queue manager (e.g. via frequent execution of "postfix reload").  </p>

<h3> <a name="deferred_queue"> The "deferred" queue </a> </h3>

<p> When all the deliverable recipients for a message are delivered,
and for some recipients delivery failed for a transient reason (it
might succeed later), the message is placed in the deferred queue.
</p>

<p> The queue manager scans the deferred queue periodically. The scan
interval is controlled by the queue_run_delay parameter.  While a deferred
queue scan is in progress, if an incoming queue scan is also in progress
(ideally these are brief since the incoming queue should be short), the
queue manager alternates between looking for messages in the "incoming"
queue and in the "deferred" queue. This "round-robin" strategy prevents
starvation of either the incoming or the deferred queues.  </p>

<p> Each deferred queue scan only brings a fraction of the deferred
queue back into the active queue for a retry. This is because each
message in the deferred queue is assigned a "cool-off" time when
it is deferred.  This is done by time-warping the modification
time of the queue file into the future. The queue file is not
eligible for a retry if its modification time is not yet reached.
</p>

<p> The "cool-off" time is at least $minimal_backoff_time and at
most $maximal_backoff_time. The next retry time is set by doubling
the message's age in the queue, and adjusting up or down to lie
within the limits. This means that young messages are initially
retried more often than old messages.  </p>

<p> If a high volume site routinely has large deferred queues, it
may be useful to adjust the queue_run_delay, minimal_backoff_time and
maximal_backoff_time to provide short enough delays on first failure
(Postfix &ge; 2.4 has a sensibly low minimal backoff time by default),
with perhaps longer delays after multiple failures, to reduce the
retransmission rate of old messages and thereby reduce the quantity
of previously deferred mail in the active queue.  If you want a really
low minimal_backoff_time, you may also want to lower queue_run_delay,
but understand that more frequent scans will increase the demand for
disk I/O. </p>

<p> One common cause of large deferred queues is failure to validate
recipients at the SMTP input stage. Since spammers routinely launch
dictionary attacks from unrepliable sender addresses, the bounces
for invalid recipient addresses clog the deferred queue (and at high
volumes proportionally clog the active queue). Recipient validation
is strongly recommended through use of the local_recipient_maps and
relay_recipient_maps parameters. Even when bounces drain quickly they
inundate innocent victims of forgery with unwanted email. To avoid
this, do not accept mail for invalid recipients. </p>

<p> When a host with lots of deferred mail is down for some time,
it is possible for the entire deferred queue to reach its retry
time simultaneously. This can lead to a very full active queue once
the host comes back up. The phenomenon can repeat approximately
every maximal_backoff_time seconds if the messages are again deferred
after a brief burst of congestion. Perhaps, a future Postfix release
will add a random offset to the retry time (or use a combination
of strategies) to reduce the odds of repeated complete deferred
queue flushes.  </p>
