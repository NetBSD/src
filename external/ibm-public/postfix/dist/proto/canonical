# NAME
#	canonical 5
# SUMMARY
#	Postfix canonical table format
# SYNOPSIS
#	\fBpostmap /etc/postfix/canonical\fR
#
#	\fBpostmap -q "\fIstring\fB" /etc/postfix/canonical\fR
#
#	\fBpostmap -q - /etc/postfix/canonical <\fIinputfile\fR
# DESCRIPTION
#	The optional \fBcanonical\fR(5) table specifies an address mapping for
#	local and non-local addresses. The mapping is used by the
#	\fBcleanup\fR(8) daemon, before mail is stored into the
#	queue.  The address mapping is recursive.
#
#	Normally, the \fBcanonical\fR(5) table is specified as a text file
#	that serves as input to the \fBpostmap\fR(1) command.
#	The result, an indexed file in \fBdbm\fR or \fBdb\fR format,
#	is used for fast searching by the mail system. Execute the command
#	"\fBpostmap /etc/postfix/canonical\fR" to rebuild an indexed
#	file after changing the corresponding text file.
#
#	When the table is provided via other means such as NIS, LDAP
#	or SQL, the same lookups are done as for ordinary indexed files.
#
#	Alternatively, the table can be provided as a regular-expression
#	map where patterns are given as regular expressions, or lookups
#	can be directed to TCP-based server. In those cases, the lookups
#	are done in a slightly different way as described below under
#	"REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES" or "TCP-BASED TABLES".
#
#	By default the \fBcanonical\fR(5) mapping affects both message
#	header addresses (i.e. addresses that appear inside messages)
#	and message envelope addresses (for example, the addresses
#	that are used in SMTP protocol commands). This is controlled with
#	the \fBcanonical_classes\fR parameter.
#
#	NOTE: Postfix versions 2.2 and later rewrite message headers
#	from remote SMTP clients only if the client matches the
#	local_header_rewrite_clients parameter, or if the
#	remote_header_rewrite_domain configuration parameter specifies
#	a non-empty value. To get the behavior before Postfix 2.2,
#	specify "local_header_rewrite_clients = static:all".
#
#	Typically, one would use the \fBcanonical\fR(5) table to replace login
#	names by \fIFirstname.Lastname\fR, or to clean up addresses produced
#	by legacy mail systems.
#
#	The \fBcanonical\fR(5) mapping is not to be confused with \fIvirtual
#	alias\fR support or with local aliasing. To change the destination
#	but not the headers, use the \fBvirtual\fR(5) or \fBaliases\fR(5)
#	map instead.
# CASE FOLDING
# .ad
# .fi
#	The search string is folded to lowercase before database
#	lookup. As of Postfix 2.3, the search string is not case
#	folded with database types such as regexp: or pcre: whose
#	lookup fields can match both upper and lower case.
# TABLE FORMAT
# .ad
# .fi
#	The input format for the \fBpostmap\fR(1) command is as follows:
# .IP "\fIpattern address\fR"
#	When \fIpattern\fR matches a mail address, replace it by the
#	corresponding \fIaddress\fR.
# .IP "blank lines and comments"
#	Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored, as
#	are lines whose first non-whitespace character is a `#'.
# .IP "multi-line text"
#	A logical line starts with non-whitespace text. A line that
#	starts with whitespace continues a logical line.
# TABLE SEARCH ORDER
# .ad
# .fi
#	With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from networked
#	tables such as NIS, LDAP or SQL, each \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR
#	query produces a sequence of query patterns as described below.
#
#	Each query pattern is sent to each specified lookup table
#	before trying the next query pattern, until a match is
#	found.
# .IP "\fIuser\fR@\fIdomain address\fR"
#	Replace \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR by \fIaddress\fR. This form
#	has the highest precedence.
#	.sp
#	This is useful to clean up addresses produced by legacy mail systems.
#	It can also be used to produce \fIFirstname.Lastname\fR style
#	addresses, but see below for a simpler solution.
# .IP "\fIuser address\fR"
#	Replace \fIuser\fR@\fIsite\fR by \fIaddress\fR when \fIsite\fR is
#	equal to $\fBmyorigin\fR, when \fIsite\fR is listed in
#	$\fBmydestination\fR, or when it is listed in $\fBinet_interfaces\fR
#	or $\fBproxy_interfaces\fR.
#	.sp
#	This form is useful for replacing login names by
#	\fIFirstname.Lastname\fR.
# .IP "@\fIdomain address\fR"
#	Replace other addresses in \fIdomain\fR by \fIaddress\fR.
#	This form has the lowest precedence.
# .sp
#	Note: @\fIdomain\fR is a wild-card. When this form is applied
#	to recipient addresses, the Postfix SMTP server accepts
#	mail for any recipient in \fIdomain\fR, regardless of whether
#	that recipient exists.  This may turn your mail system into
#	a backscatter source: Postfix first accepts mail for
#	non-existent recipients and then tries to return that mail
#	as "undeliverable" to the often forged sender address.
# .sp
#	To avoid backscatter with mail for a wild-card domain,
#	replace the wild-card mapping with explicit 1:1 mappings,
#	or add a reject_unverified_recipient restriction for that
#	domain:
#
# .nf
#	    smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
#		...
#		reject_unauth_destination
#		check_recipient_access
#		    inline:{example.com=reject_unverified_recipient}
#	    unverified_recipient_reject_code = 550
# .fi
#
#	In the above example, Postfix may contact a remote server
#	if the recipient is rewritten to a remote address.
# RESULT ADDRESS REWRITING
# .ad
# .fi
#	The lookup result is subject to address rewriting:
# .IP \(bu
#	When the result has the form @\fIotherdomain\fR, the
#	result becomes the same \fIuser\fR in \fIotherdomain\fR.
# .IP \(bu
#	When "\fBappend_at_myorigin=yes\fR", append "\fB@$myorigin\fR"
#	to addresses without "@domain".
# .IP \(bu
#	When "\fBappend_dot_mydomain=yes\fR", append
#	"\fB.$mydomain\fR" to addresses without ".domain".
# ADDRESS EXTENSION
# .fi
# .ad
#	When a mail address localpart contains the optional recipient delimiter
#	(e.g., \fIuser+foo\fR@\fIdomain\fR), the lookup order becomes:
#	\fIuser+foo\fR@\fIdomain\fR, \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR, \fIuser+foo\fR,
#	\fIuser\fR, and @\fIdomain\fR.
#
#	The \fBpropagate_unmatched_extensions\fR parameter controls whether
#	an unmatched address extension (\fI+foo\fR) is propagated to the 
#	result of table lookup.
# REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES
# .ad
# .fi
#	This section describes how the table lookups change when the table
#	is given in the form of regular expressions. For a description of
#	regular expression lookup table syntax, see \fBregexp_table\fR(5)
#	or \fBpcre_table\fR(5).
#
#	Each pattern is a regular expression that is applied to the entire
#	address being looked up. Thus, \fIuser@domain\fR mail addresses are not
#	broken up into their \fIuser\fR and \fI@domain\fR constituent parts,
#	nor is \fIuser+foo\fR broken up into \fIuser\fR and \fIfoo\fR.
#
#	Patterns are applied in the order as specified in the table, until a
#	pattern is found that matches the search string.
#
#	Results are the same as with indexed file lookups, with
#	the additional feature that parenthesized substrings from the
#	pattern can be interpolated as \fB$1\fR, \fB$2\fR and so on.
# TCP-BASED TABLES
# .ad
# .fi
#	This section describes how the table lookups change when lookups
#	are directed to a TCP-based server. For a description of the TCP
#	client/server lookup protocol, see \fBtcp_table\fR(5).
#	This feature is not available up to and including Postfix version 2.4.
#	
#	Each lookup operation uses the entire address once.  Thus,
#	\fIuser@domain\fR mail addresses are not broken up into their
#	\fIuser\fR and \fI@domain\fR constituent parts, nor is
#	\fIuser+foo\fR broken up into \fIuser\fR and \fIfoo\fR.
#
#	Results are the same as with indexed file lookups.
# BUGS
#	The table format does not understand quoting conventions.
