# NAME
#	generic 5
# SUMMARY
#	Postfix generic table format
# SYNOPSIS
#	\fBpostmap /etc/postfix/generic\fR
#
#	\fBpostmap -q "\fIstring\fB" /etc/postfix/generic\fR
#
#	\fBpostmap -q - /etc/postfix/generic <\fIinputfile\fR
# DESCRIPTION
#	The optional \fBgeneric\fR(5) table specifies an address
#	mapping that applies when mail is delivered. This is the
#	opposite of \fBcanonical\fR(5) mapping, which applies when
#	mail is received.
#
#	Typically, one would use the \fBgeneric\fR(5) table on a
#	system that does not have a valid Internet domain name and
#	that uses something like \fIlocaldomain.local\fR instead.
#	The \fBgeneric\fR(5) table is then used by the \fBsmtp\fR(8)
#	client to transform local mail addresses into valid Internet
#	mail addresses when mail has to be sent across the Internet.
#	See the EXAMPLE section at the end of this document.
#
#	The \fBgeneric\fR(5) mapping affects both message header
#	addresses (i.e. addresses that appear inside messages) and
#	message envelope addresses (for example, the addresses that
#	are used in SMTP protocol commands).
#
#	Normally, the \fBgeneric\fR(5) table is specified as a
#	text file that serves as input to the \fBpostmap\fR(1)
#	command.  The result, an indexed file in \fBdbm\fR or
#	\fBdb\fR format, is used for fast searching by the mail
#	system. Execute the command "\fBpostmap /etc/postfix/generic\fR"
#	to rebuild an indexed file after changing the corresponding
#	text file.
#
#	When the table is provided via other means such as NIS, LDAP
#	or SQL, the same lookups are done as for ordinary indexed files.
#
#	Alternatively, the table can be provided as a regular-expression
#	map where patterns are given as regular expressions, or lookups
#	can be directed to a TCP-based server. In those cases, the lookups
#	are done in a slightly different way as described below under
#	"REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES" or "TCP-BASED TABLES".
# CASE FOLDING
# .ad
# .fi
#	The search string is folded to lowercase before database
#	lookup. As of Postfix 2.3, the search string is not case
#	folded with database types such as regexp: or pcre: whose
#	lookup fields can match both upper and lower case.
# TABLE FORMAT
# .ad
# .fi
#	The input format for the \fBpostmap\fR(1) command is as follows:
# .IP "\fIpattern result\fR"
#	When \fIpattern\fR matches a mail address, replace it by the
#	corresponding \fIresult\fR.
# .IP "blank lines and comments"
#	Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored, as
#	are lines whose first non-whitespace character is a `#'.
# .IP "multi-line text"
#	A logical line starts with non-whitespace text. A line that
#	starts with whitespace continues a logical line.
# TABLE SEARCH ORDER
# .ad
# .fi
#	With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from networked
#	tables such as NIS, LDAP or SQL, each \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR
#	query produces a sequence of query patterns as described below.
#
#	Each query pattern is sent to each specified lookup table
#	before trying the next query pattern, until a match is
#	found.
# .IP "\fIuser\fR@\fIdomain address\fR"
#	Replace \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR by \fIaddress\fR. This form
#	has the highest precedence.
# .IP "\fIuser address\fR"
#	Replace \fIuser\fR@\fIsite\fR by \fIaddress\fR when \fIsite\fR is
#	equal to $\fBmyorigin\fR, when \fIsite\fR is listed in
#	$\fBmydestination\fR, or when it is listed in $\fBinet_interfaces\fR
#	or $\fBproxy_interfaces\fR.
# .IP "@\fIdomain address\fR"
#	Replace other addresses in \fIdomain\fR by \fIaddress\fR.
#	This form has the lowest precedence.
# RESULT ADDRESS REWRITING
# .ad
# .fi
#	The lookup result is subject to address rewriting:
# .IP \(bu
#	When the result has the form @\fIotherdomain\fR, the
#	result becomes the same \fIuser\fR in \fIotherdomain\fR.
# .IP \(bu
#	When "\fBappend_at_myorigin=yes\fR", append "\fB@$myorigin\fR"
#	to addresses without "@domain".
# .IP \(bu
#	When "\fBappend_dot_mydomain=yes\fR", append
#	"\fB.$mydomain\fR" to addresses without ".domain".
# ADDRESS EXTENSION
# .fi
# .ad
#	When a mail address localpart contains the optional recipient delimiter
#	(e.g., \fIuser+foo\fR@\fIdomain\fR), the lookup order becomes:
#	\fIuser+foo\fR@\fIdomain\fR, \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR, \fIuser+foo\fR,
#	\fIuser\fR, and @\fIdomain\fR.
#
#	The \fBpropagate_unmatched_extensions\fR parameter controls whether
#	an unmatched address extension (\fI+foo\fR) is propagated to the 
#	result of table lookup.
# REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES
# .ad
# .fi
#	This section describes how the table lookups change when the table
#	is given in the form of regular expressions. For a description of
#	regular expression lookup table syntax, see \fBregexp_table\fR(5)
#	or \fBpcre_table\fR(5).
#
#	Each pattern is a regular expression that is applied to the entire
#	address being looked up. Thus, \fIuser@domain\fR mail addresses are not
#	broken up into their \fIuser\fR and \fI@domain\fR constituent parts,
#	nor is \fIuser+foo\fR broken up into \fIuser\fR and \fIfoo\fR.
#
#	Patterns are applied in the order as specified in the table, until a
#	pattern is found that matches the search string.
#
#	Results are the same as with indexed file lookups, with
#	the additional feature that parenthesized substrings from the
#	pattern can be interpolated as \fB$1\fR, \fB$2\fR and so on.
# TCP-BASED TABLES
# .ad
# .fi
#	This section describes how the table lookups change when lookups
#	are directed to a TCP-based server. For a description of the TCP
#	client/server lookup protocol, see \fBtcp_table\fR(5).
#	This feature is available in Postfix 2.5 and later.
#	
#	Each lookup operation uses the entire address once.  Thus,
#	\fIuser@domain\fR mail addresses are not broken up into their
#	\fIuser\fR and \fI@domain\fR constituent parts, nor is
#	\fIuser+foo\fR broken up into \fIuser\fR and \fIfoo\fR.
#
#	Results are the same as with indexed file lookups.
# EXAMPLE
# .ad
# .fi
#	The following shows a generic mapping with an indexed file.
#	When mail is sent to a remote host via SMTP, this replaces
#	\fIhis@localdomain.local\fR by his ISP mail address, replaces
#	\fIher@localdomain.local\fR by her ISP mail address, and
#	replaces other local addresses by his ISP account, with
#	an address extension of \fI+local\fR (this example assumes
#	that the ISP supports "+" style address extensions).
#
# .na
# .nf
#	/etc/postfix/main.cf:
#	    smtp_generic_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/generic
#
#	/etc/postfix/generic:
#	    his@localdomain.local   hisaccount@hisisp.example
#	    her@localdomain.local   heraccount@herisp.example
#	    @localdomain.local      hisaccount+local@hisisp.example
#
# .ad
# .fi
#	Execute the command "\fBpostmap /etc/postfix/generic\fR"
#	whenever the table is changed.  Instead of \fBhash\fR, some
#	systems use \fBdbm\fR database files. To find out what
#	tables your system supports use the command "\fBpostconf
#	-m\fR".
# BUGS
#	The table format does not understand quoting conventions.
# CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
