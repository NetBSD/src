# NAME
#	relocated 5
# SUMMARY
#	Postfix relocated table format
# SYNOPSIS
#	\fBpostmap /etc/postfix/relocated\fR
# DESCRIPTION
#	The optional \fBrelocated\fR(5) table provides the information that is
#	used in "user has moved to \fInew_location\fR" bounce messages.
#
#	Normally, the \fBrelocated\fR(5) table is specified as a text file
#	that serves as input to the \fBpostmap\fR(1) command.
#	The result, an indexed file in \fBdbm\fR or \fBdb\fR format,
#	is used for fast searching by the mail system. Execute the command
#	"\fBpostmap /etc/postfix/relocated\fR" to rebuild an indexed
#	file after changing the corresponding relocated table.
#
#	When the table is provided via other means such as NIS, LDAP
#	or SQL, the same lookups are done as for ordinary indexed files.
#
#	Alternatively, the table can be provided as a regular-expression
#	map where patterns are given as regular expressions, or lookups
#	can be directed to a TCP-based server. In those case, the lookups
#	are done in a slightly different way as described below under
#	"REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES" or "TCP-BASED TABLES".
#
#	Table lookups are case insensitive.
# CASE FOLDING
# .ad
# .fi
#	The search string is folded to lowercase before database
#	lookup. As of Postfix 2.3, the search string is not case
#	folded with database types such as regexp: or pcre: whose
#	lookup fields can match both upper and lower case.
# TABLE FORMAT
# .ad
# .fi
#	The input format for the \fBpostmap\fR(1) command is as follows:
# .IP \(bu
#	An entry has one of the following form:
#
# .nf
#	     \fIpattern      new_location\fR
# .fi
#
#	Where \fInew_location\fR specifies contact information such as
#	an email address, or perhaps a street address or telephone number.
# .IP \(bu
#	Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored, as
#	are lines whose first non-whitespace character is a `#'.
# .IP \(bu
#	A logical line starts with non-whitespace text. A line that
#	starts with whitespace continues a logical line.
# TABLE SEARCH ORDER
# .ad
# .fi
#	With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from networked
#	tables such as NIS, LDAP or SQL, patterns are tried in the order as
#	listed below:
# .IP \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR
#	Matches \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR. This form has precedence over all
#	other forms.
# .IP \fIuser\fR
#	Matches \fIuser\fR@\fIsite\fR when \fIsite\fR is $\fBmyorigin\fR,
#	when \fIsite\fR is listed in $\fBmydestination\fR, or when \fIsite\fR
#	is listed in $\fBinet_interfaces\fR or $\fBproxy_interfaces\fR.
# .IP @\fIdomain\fR
#	Matches other addresses in \fIdomain\fR. This form has the lowest
#	precedence.
# ADDRESS EXTENSION
# .fi
# .ad
#	When a mail address localpart contains the optional recipient delimiter
#	(e.g., \fIuser+foo\fR@\fIdomain\fR), the lookup order becomes:
#	\fIuser+foo\fR@\fIdomain\fR, \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR, \fIuser+foo\fR,
#	\fIuser\fR, and @\fIdomain\fR.
# REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES
# .ad
# .fi
#	This section describes how the table lookups change when the table
#	is given in the form of regular expressions or when lookups are
#	directed to a TCP-based server. For a description of regular
#	expression lookup table syntax, see \fBregexp_table\fR(5) or
#	\fBpcre_table\fR(5). For a description of the TCP client/server
#	table lookup protocol, see \fBtcp_table\fR(5).
#	This feature is available in Postfix 2.5 and later.
#
#	Each pattern is a regular expression that is applied to the entire
#	address being looked up. Thus, \fIuser@domain\fR mail addresses are not
#	broken up into their \fIuser\fR and \fI@domain\fR constituent parts,
#	nor is \fIuser+foo\fR broken up into \fIuser\fR and \fIfoo\fR.
#
#	Patterns are applied in the order as specified in the table, until a
#	pattern is found that matches the search string.
#
#	Results are the same as with indexed file lookups, with
#	the additional feature that parenthesized substrings from the
#	pattern can be interpolated as \fB$1\fR, \fB$2\fR and so on.
# TCP-BASED TABLES
# .ad
# .fi
#	This section describes how the table lookups change when lookups
#	are directed to a TCP-based server. For a description of the TCP
#	client/server lookup protocol, see \fBtcp_table\fR(5).
#	This feature is available in Postfix 2.5 and later.
#
#	Each lookup operation uses the entire address once.  Thus,
#	\fIuser@domain\fR mail addresses are not broken up into their
#	\fIuser\fR and \fI@domain\fR constituent parts, nor is
#	\fIuser+foo\fR broken up into \fIuser\fR and \fIfoo\fR.
#
#	Results are the same as with indexed file lookups.
# BUGS
#	The table format does not understand quoting conventions.
# CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
# .ad
# .fi
#	The following \fBmain.cf\fR parameters are especially relevant.  
#	The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
#	\fBpostconf\fR(5) for more details including examples.
# .IP "\fBrelocated_maps (empty)\fR"
#	Optional lookup tables with new contact information for users or
#	domains that no longer exist.
# .PP
#	Other parameters of interest:
# .IP "\fBinet_interfaces (all)\fR"
#	The network interface addresses that this mail system receives
#	mail on.
# .IP "\fBmydestination ($myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost)\fR"
#	The list of domains that are delivered via the $local_transport
#	mail delivery transport.
# .IP "\fBmyorigin ($myhostname)\fR"
#	The domain name that locally-posted mail appears to come
#	from, and that locally posted mail is delivered to.
# .IP "\fBproxy_interfaces (empty)\fR"
#	The network interface addresses that this mail system receives mail
#	on by way of a proxy or network address translation unit.
