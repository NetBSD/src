.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBpostlog\fR(1) command implements a Postfix\-compatible logging
interface for use in, for example, shell scripts.

By default, \fBpostlog\fR(1) logs the \fItext\fR given on the command
line as one record. If no \fItext\fR is specified on the command
line, \fBpostlog\fR(1) reads from standard input and logs each input
line as one record.

By default, logging is sent to \fBsyslogd\fR(8) or
\fBpostlogd\fR(8); when the
standard error stream is connected to a terminal, logging
is sent there as well.

The following options are implemented:
.IP "\fB\-c \fIconfig_dir\fR"
Read the \fBmain.cf\fR configuration file in the named directory
instead of the default configuration directory.
.IP "\fB\-i\fR (obsolete)"
Include the process ID in the logging tag. This flag is ignored as
of Postfix 3.4, where the PID is always included.
.IP "\fB\-p \fIpriority\fR (default: \fBinfo\fR)"
Specifies the logging severity: \fBinfo\fR, \fBwarn\fR,
\fBerror\fR, \fBfatal\fR, or \fBpanic\fR. With Postfix 3.1
and later, the program will pause for 1 second after reporting
a \fBfatal\fR or \fBpanic\fR condition, just like other
Postfix programs.
.IP "\fB\-t \fItag\fR"
Specifies the logging tag, that is, the identifying name that
appears at the beginning of each logging record. A default tag
is used when none is specified.
.IP \fB\-v\fR
Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple \fB\-v\fR
options make the software increasingly verbose.
.SH "SECURITY"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The \fBpostlog\fR(1) command is designed to run with
set\-groupid privileges, so that it can connect to the
\fBpostlogd\fR(8) daemon process (Postfix 3.7 and later;
earlier implementations of this command must not have
set\-groupid or set\-userid permissions).
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
.IP MAIL_CONFIG
Directory with the \fBmain.cf\fR file.
.SH "CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"

The following \fBmain.cf\fR parameters are especially relevant to
this program.

The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
\fBpostconf\fR(5) for more details including examples.
.IP "\fBconfig_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)\fR"
The default location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf
configuration files.
.IP "\fBimport_environment (see 'postconf -d' output)\fR"
The list of environment variables that a privileged Postfix
process will import from a non\-Postfix parent process, or name=value
environment overrides.
.IP "\fBsyslog_facility (mail)\fR"
The syslog facility of Postfix logging.
.IP "\fBsyslog_name (see 'postconf -d' output)\fR"
A prefix that is prepended to the process name in syslog
records, so that, for example, "smtpd" becomes "prefix/smtpd".
.PP
Available in Postfix 3.4 and later:
.IP "\fBmaillog_file (empty)\fR"
The name of an optional logfile that is written by the Postfix
\fBpostlogd\fR(8) service.
.IP "\fBpostlog_service_name (postlog)\fR"
The name of the \fBpostlogd\fR(8) service entry in master.cf.
