.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
\fBsmtp\-source\fR connects to the named \fIhost\fR and TCP \fIport\fR
(default: port 25)
and sends one or more messages to it, either sequentially
or in parallel. The program speaks either SMTP (default) or
LMTP.
Connections can be made to UNIX\-domain and IPv4 or IPv6 servers.
IPv4 and IPv6 are the default.

Note: this is an unsupported test program. No attempt is made
to maintain compatibility between successive versions.

Arguments:
.IP \fB\-4\fR
Connect to the server with IPv4. This option has no effect when
Postfix is built without IPv6 support.
.IP \fB\-6\fR
Connect to the server with IPv6. This option is not available when
Postfix is built without IPv6 support.
.IP "\fB\-A\fR"
Don't abort when the server sends something other than the
expected positive reply code.
.IP \fB\-c\fR
Display a running counter that is incremented each time
an SMTP DATA command completes.
.IP "\fB\-C \fIcount\fR"
When a host sends RESET instead of SYN|ACK, try \fIcount\fR times
before giving up. The default count is 1. Specify a larger count in
order to work around a problem with TCP/IP stacks that send RESET
when the listen queue is full.
.IP \fB\-d\fR
Don't disconnect after sending a message; send the next
message over the same connection.
.IP "\fB\-f \fIfrom\fR"
Use the specified sender address (default: <foo@myhostname>).
.IP "\fB\-F \fIfile\fR"
Send the pre\-formatted message header and body in the
specified \fIfile\fR, while prepending '.' before lines that
begin with '.', and while appending CRLF after each line.
.IP "\fB\-l \fIlength\fR"
Send \fIlength\fR bytes as message payload. The length does not
include message headers.
.IP \fB\-L\fR
Speak LMTP rather than SMTP.
.IP "\fB\-m \fImessage_count\fR"
Send the specified number of messages (default: 1).
.IP "\fB\-M \fImyhostname\fR"
Use the specified hostname or [address] in the HELO command
and in the default sender and recipient addresses, instead
of the machine hostname.
.IP "\fB\-N\fR"
Prepend a non\-repeating sequence number to each recipient
address. This avoids the artificial 100% hit rate in the
resolve and rewrite client caches and exercises the
trivial\-rewrite daemon, better approximating Postfix
performance under real\-life work\-loads.
.IP \fB\-o\fR
Old mode: don't send HELO, and don't send message headers.
.IP "\fB\-r \fIrecipient_count\fR"
Send the specified number of recipients per transaction (default: 1).
Recipient names are generated by prepending a number to the
recipient address.
.IP "\fB\-R \fIinterval\fR"
Wait for a random period of time 0 <= n <= interval between messages.
Suspending one thread does not affect other delivery threads.
.IP "\fB\-s \fIsession_count\fR"
Run the specified number of SMTP sessions in parallel (default: 1).
.IP "\fB\-S \fIsubject\fR"
Send mail with the named subject line (default: none).
.IP "\fB\-t \fIto\fR"
Use the specified recipient address (default: <foo@myhostname>).
.IP "\fB\-T \fIwindowsize\fR"
Override the default TCP window size. To work around
broken TCP window scaling implementations, specify a
value > 0 and < 65536.
.IP \fB\-v\fR
Make the program more verbose, for debugging purposes.
.IP "\fB\-w \fIinterval\fR"
Wait a fixed time between messages.
Suspending one thread does not affect other delivery threads.
.IP [\fBinet:\fR]\fIhost\fR[:\fIport\fR]
Connect via TCP to host \fIhost\fR, port \fIport\fR. The default
port is \fBsmtp\fR.
.IP \fBunix:\fIpathname\fR
Connect to the UNIX\-domain socket at \fIpathname\fR.
