.SH NAME
postlogd
\-
Postfix internal log server
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.na
.nf
\fBpostlogd\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
This program logs events on behalf of Postfix programs
when the maillog configuration parameter specifies a non\-empty
value.
.SH BUGS
.ad
.fi
Non\-daemon Postfix programs don't know that they should log
to the internal logging service before they have processed
command\-line options and main.cf parameters. These programs
still log earlier events to the syslog service.

If Postfix is down, the non\-daemon programs \fBpostfix\fR(1),
\fBpostsuper\fR(1), \fBpostmulti\fR(1), and \fBpostlog\fR(1),
will log directly to \fB$maillog_file\fR. These programs
expect to run with root privileges, for example during
Postfix start\-up, reload, or shutdown.

Other non\-daemon Postfix programs will never write directly to
\fB$maillog_file\fR (also, logging to stdout would interfere
with the operation of some of these programs). These programs
can log to \fBpostlogd\fR(8) if they are run by the super\-user,
or if their executable file has set\-gid permission. Do not
set this permission on programs other than \fBpostdrop\fR(1),
\fBpostqueue\fR(1) and (Postfix >= 3.7) \fBpostlog\fR(1).
.SH "CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
Changes to \fBmain.cf\fR are picked up automatically, as
\fBpostlogd\fR(8) processes run for only a limited amount
of time. Use the command "\fBpostfix reload\fR" to speed
up a change.

The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
\fBpostconf\fR(5) for more details including examples.
.IP "\fBconfig_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)\fR"
The default location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf
configuration files.
.IP "\fBmaillog_file (empty)\fR"
The name of an optional logfile that is written by the Postfix
\fBpostlogd\fR(8) service.
.IP "\fBprocess_id (read\-only)\fR"
The process ID of a Postfix command or daemon process.
.IP "\fBprocess_name (read\-only)\fR"
The process name of a Postfix command or daemon process.
.IP "\fBsyslog_name (see 'postconf -d' output)\fR"
A prefix that is prepended to the process name in syslog
records, so that, for example, "smtpd" becomes "prefix/smtpd".
.IP "\fBservice_name (read\-only)\fR"
The master.cf service name of a Postfix daemon process.
.IP "\fBpostlogd_watchdog_timeout (10s)\fR"
How much time a \fBpostlogd\fR(8) process may take to process a request
before it is terminated by a built\-in watchdog timer.
