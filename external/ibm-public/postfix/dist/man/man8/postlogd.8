.SH NAME
postlogd
\-
Postfix internal log server
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.na
.nf
\fBpostlogd\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
This program logs events on behalf of Postfix programs
when the maillog configuration parameter specifies a non\-empty
value.
.SH BUGS
.ad
.fi
Non\-daemon Postfix programs don't know that they should log
to the internal logging service before they have processed
command\-line options and main.cf parameters. These programs
still log earlier events to the syslog service.

If Postfix is down, the non\-daemon programs \fBpostfix\fR(1),
\fBpostsuper\fR(1), \fBpostmulti\fR(1), and \fBpostlog\fR(1),
will log directly to \fB$maillog_file\fR. These programs
expect to run with root privileges, for example during
Postfix start\-up, reload, or shutdown.

Other non\-daemon Postfix programs will never write directly to
\fB$maillog_file\fR (also, logging to stdout would interfere
with the operation of some of these programs). These programs
can log to \fBpostlogd\fR(8) if they are run by the super\-user,
or if their executable file has set\-gid permission. Do not
set this permission on programs other than \fBpostdrop\fR(1)
and \fBpostqueue\fR(1).
.SH "CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
Changes to \fBmain.cf\fR are picked up automatically, as
\fBpostlogd\fR(8) processes run for only a limited amount
of time. Use the command "\fBpostfix reload\fR" to speed
up a change.

The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
\fBpostconf\fR(5) for more details including examples.
.IP "\fBconfig_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)\fR"
The default location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf
configuration files.
.IP "\fBmaillog_file (empty)\fR"
The name of an optional logfile that is written by the Postfix
\fBpostlogd\fR(8) service.
.IP "\fBprocess_id (read\-only)\fR"
The process ID of a Postfix command or daemon process.
.IP "\fBprocess_name (read\-only)\fR"
The process name of a Postfix command or daemon process.
.IP "\fBsyslog_name (see 'postconf -d' output)\fR"
A prefix that is prepended to the process name in syslog
records, so that, for example, "smtpd" becomes "prefix/smtpd".
.IP "\fBservice_name (read\-only)\fR"
The master.cf service name of a Postfix daemon process.
.IP "\fBpostlogd_watchdog_timeout (10s)\fR"
How much time a \fBpostlogd\fR(8) process may take to process a request
before it is terminated by a built\-in watchdog timer.
