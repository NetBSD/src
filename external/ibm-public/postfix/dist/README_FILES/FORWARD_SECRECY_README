Forward secrecy does not protect against active attacks such as forged DNS
replies or forged TLS server certificates. If such attacks are a concern, then
the SMTP client will need to authenticate the remote SMTP server in a
sufficiently-secure manner. For example, by the fingerprint of a (CA or leaf)
public key or certificate. Conventional PKI relies on many trusted parties and
is easily subverted by a state-funded adversary.

Postfix supports forward secrecy of TLS network communication since version
2.2. This support was adopted from Lutz Jänicke's "Postfix TLS patch" for
earlier Postfix versions. This document will focus on TLS Forward Secrecy in
the Postfix SMTP client and server. See TLS_README for a general description of
Postfix TLS support.

The term "Forward Secrecy" (or sometimes "Perfect Forward Secrecy") is used to
describe security protocols in which the confidentiality of past traffic is not
compromised when long-term keys used by either or both sides are later
disclosed.

Forward secrecy is accomplished by negotiating session keys using per-session
cryptographically-strong random numbers that are not saved, and signing the
exchange with long-term authentication keys. Later disclosure of the long-term
keys allows impersonation of the key holder from that point on, but not
recovery of prior traffic, since with forward secrecy, the discarded random key
agreement inputs are not available to the attacker.

Forward secrecy is only "perfect" when brute-force attacks on the key agreement
algorithm are impractical even for the best-funded adversary and the random-
number generators used by both parties are sufficiently strong. Otherwise,
forward secrecy leaves the attacker with the challenge of cracking the key-
agreement protocol, which is likely quite computationally intensive, but may be
feasible for sessions of sufficiently high value. Thus forward secrecy places
cost constraints on the efficacy of bulk surveillance, recovering all past
traffic is generally infeasible, and even recovery of individual sessions may
be infeasible given a sufficiently-strong key agreement method.

Early implementations of the SSL protocol do not provide forward secrecy (some
provide it only with artificially-weakened "export" cipher suites, but we will
ignore those here). The client sends a random "pre-master secret" to the server
encrypted with the server's RSA public key. The server decrypts this with its
private key, and uses it together with other data exchanged in the clear to
generate the session key. An attacker with access to the server's private key
can perform the same computation at any later time. The TLS library in Windows
XP and Windows Server 2003 only supported cipher suites of this type, and
Exchange 2003 servers largely do not support forward secrecy.

Later revisions to the TLS protocol introduced forward-secrecy cipher suites in
which the client and server implement a key exchange protocol based on
ephemeral secrets. Sessions encrypted with one of these newer cipher suites are
not compromised by future disclosure of long-term authentication keys.

The key-exchange algorithms used for forward secrecy require the TLS server to
designate appropriate "parameters" consisting of a mathematical "group" and an
element of that group called a "generator". Presently, there are two flavors of
"groups" that work with PFS:

  * PPrriimmee--ffiieelldd ggrroouuppss ((EEDDHH)):: The server needs to be configured with a
    suitably-large prime and a corresponding "generator". The acronym for
    forward secrecy over prime fields is EDH for Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (also
    abbreviated as DHE).

  * EElllliippttiicc--ccuurrvvee ggrroouuppss ((EEEECCDDHH)):: The server needs to be configured with a
    "named curve". These offer better security at lower computational cost than
    prime field groups, but are not as widely implemented. The acronym for the
    elliptic curve version is EECDH which is short for Ephemeral Elliptic Curve
    Diffie-Hellman (also abbreviated as ECDHE).

It is not essential to know what these are, but one does need to know that
OpenSSL supports EECDH with version 1.0.0 or later. Thus the configuration
parameters related to Elliptic-Curve forward secrecy are available when Postfix
is linked with OpenSSL >= 1.0.0 (provided EC support has not been disabled by
the vendor, as in some versions of RedHat Linux).

Elliptic curves used in cryptography are typically identified by a "name" that
stands for a set of well-known parameter values, and it is these "names" (or
associated ASN.1 object identifiers) that are used in the TLS protocol. On the
other hand, with TLS there are no specially designated prime field groups, so
each server is free to select its own suitably-strong prime and generator.

The Postfix >= 2.2 SMTP server supports forward secrecy in its default
configuration. If the remote SMTP client prefers cipher suites with forward
secrecy, then the traffic between the server and client will resist decryption
even if the server's long-term authentication keys are later compromised.

Some remote SMTP clients may support forward secrecy, but prefer cipher suites
without forward secrecy. In that case, Postfix >= 2.8 could be configured to
ignore the client's preference with the main.cf setting "tls_preempt_cipherlist
= yes". However, this will likely cause interoperability issues with older
Exchange servers and is not recommended for now.

EEDDHH SSeerrvveerr ssuuppppoorrtt

Postfix >= 2.2 support 1024-bit-prime EDH out of the box, with no additional
configuration, but you may want to override the default prime to be 2048 bits
long, and you may want to regenerate your primes periodically. See the quick-
start section for details.

With prime-field EDH, OpenSSL wants the server to provide two explicitly-
selected (prime, generator) combinations. One for the now long-obsolete
"export" cipher suites, and another for non-export cipher suites. Postfix has
two such default combinations compiled in, but also supports explicitly-
configured overrides.

  * The "export" EDH parameters are used only with the obsolete "export"
    ciphers. To use a non-default prime, generate a 512-bit DH parameter file
    and set smtpd_tls_dh512_param_file to the filename (see the quick-start
    section for details).

  * The non-export EDH parameters are used for all other EDH cipher suites. To
    use a non-default prime, generate a 1024-bit or 2048-bit DH parameter file
    and set smtpd_tls_dh1024_param_file to the filename. Despite the name this
    is simply the non-export parameter file and the prime need not actually be
    1024 bits long (see the quick-start section for details).

It turns out that (inadvisably-patched in some Debian releases) Exim SMTP
clients require a >= 2048-bit length for the non-export prime. See the quick-
start section for the recommended configuration to work around this issue.

Postfix >= 2.6 support NIST P-256 EECDH when built with OpenSSL >= 1.0.0. When
the remote SMTP client also supports EECDH and implements the P-256 curve,
forward secrecy just works.

    Note: With Postfix 2.6 and 2.7, enable EECDH by setting the main.cf
    parameter smtpd_tls_eecdh_grade to "strong".

The elliptic curve situation is evolving, with new curves being introduced to
augment or replace the NIST curves tarnished by the Snowden revelations.
Fortunately, TLS clients advertise the list of supported curves to the server
so that servers can in principle choose newer stronger curves when mutually
supported. The OpenSSL code for making this possible is not yet released as of
late 2013 (it is available only in OpenSSL development snapshots).

At some point Postfix will need to adjust to the new API for setting the
elliptic-curve options. Fortunately, when EECDH support was added to Postfix,
it introduced a layer of indirection:

        smtpd_tls_eecdh_grade = strong | ultra
        tls_eecdh_strong_curve = prime256v1
        tls_eecdh_ultra_curve = secp384r1

When it becomes possible in OpenSSL to support a "menu" of curves, we will
likely extend "tls_eecdh_strong_curve" to be an ordered list of curves and
likewise with the "ultra" version, where the two might now overlap, and differ
mostly in the preference order. As a result most existing configurations will
then support more curves at the desired security level without any changes to
main.cf.

The Postfix >= 2.2 SMTP client supports forward secrecy in its default
configuration. No configuration changes are needed besides turning on elliptic-
curve support with Postfix 2.6 and 2.7 (see the quick-start section). If the
remote SMTP server supports cipher suites with forward secrecy (and does not
override the SMTP client's cipher preference), then the traffic between the
server and client will resist decryption even if the server's long-term
authentication keys are later compromised.

The default Postfix SMTP client cipher lists are correctly ordered to prefer
EECDH and EDH cipher suites ahead of similar cipher suites that don't implement
forward secrecy. Administrators are strongly discouraged from changing the
cipher list definitions. It is likely safe to set "smtp_tls_ciphers = medium"
if you wish to disable the obsolete "export" and "low" grade ciphers even with
opportunistic TLS. Setting a minimum strength does not change the preference
order. Note that strengths higher than "medium" exclude Exchange 2003 and
likely other widely used MTAs, thus "high" grade ciphers should only be used on
a case-by-case basis via the TLS policy table.

With Postfix 2.6 and 2.7, enable elliptic-curve support in the Postfix SMTP
client and server. This is the default with Postfix >= 2.8. Note, however, that
elliptic-curve support may be disabled by the vendor, as in some versions of
RedHat Linux.

    /etc/postfix/main.cf:

Optionally generate non-default Postfix SMTP server EDH parameters for improved
security against pre-computation attacks and for compatibility with Debian-
patched Exim SMTP clients that require a >= 2048-bit length for the non-export
prime.

Execute as root (prime group generation can take a few seconds to a few
minutes):

    # cd /etc/postfix
    # umask 022
    # openssl dhparam -out dh512.tmp 512 && mv dh512.tmp dh512.pem
    # openssl dhparam -out dh1024.tmp 1024 && mv dh1024.tmp dh1024.pem
    # openssl dhparam -out dh2048.tmp 2048 && mv dh2048.tmp dh2048.pem
    # chmod 644 dh512.pem dh1024.pem dh2048.pem

The Postfix SMTP server EDH parameter files are not secret, after all these
parameters are sent to all remote SMTP clients in the clear. Mode 0644 is fine.

You can improve security against pre-computation attacks further by
regenerating the Postfix SMTP server EDH parameters periodically (an hourly or
daily cron job running the above commands as root can automate this task).

Once the parameters are in place, update main.cf as follows:

    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        smtpd_tls_dh1024_param_file = ${config_directory}/dh2048.pem
        smtpd_tls_dh512_param_file = ${config_directory}/dh512.pem

If some of your MSA clients don't support 2048-bit EDH, you may need to adjust
the submission entry in master.cf accordingly:

    /etc/postfix/master.cf:
        submission inet n       -       n       -       -       smtpd
            # Some submission clients may not yet do 2048-bit EDH, if such
            # clients use your MSA, configure 1024-bit EDH instead:
            -o smtpd_tls_dh1024_param_file=${config_directory}/dh1024.pem
            -o smtpd_tls_security_level=encrypt
            -o smtpd_sasl_auth_enable=yes
            ...

Postfix can be configured to report information about the negotiated cipher,
the corresponding key lengths, and the remote peer certificate or public-key
verification status.

  * With "smtp_tls_loglevel = 1" and "smtpd_tls_loglevel = 1", the Postfix SMTP
    client and server will log TLS connection information to the maillog file.
    The general logfile format is:

        postfix/smtp[process-id]: Untrusted TLS connection established
        to host.example.com[192.168.0.2]:25: TLSv1 with cipher cipher-name
        (actual-key-size/raw-key-size bits)

        postfix/smtpd[process-id]: Anonymous TLS connection established
        from host.example.com[192.168.0.2]: TLSv1 with cipher cipher-name
        (actual-key-size/raw-key-size bits)

  * With "smtpd_tls_received_header = yes", the Postfix SMTP server will record
    TLS connection information in the Received: header in the form of comments
    (text inside parentheses). The general format depends on the
    smtpd_tls_ask_ccert setting:

        Received: from host.example.com (host.example.com [192.168.0.2])
                (using TLSv1 with cipher cipher-name
                (actual-key-size/raw-key-size bits))
                (Client CN "host.example.com", Issuer "John Doe" (not
        verified))

        Received: from host.example.com (host.example.com [192.168.0.2])
                (using TLSv1 with cipher cipher-name
                (actual-key-size/raw-key-size bits))
                (No client certificate requested)

The next sections will explain what cipher-name, key-size, and peer
verification status information to expect.

There are dozens of ciphers that support forward secrecy. What follows is the
beginning of a list of 51 ciphers available with OpenSSL 1.0.1e. The list is
sorted in the default Postfix preference order. It excludes null ciphers that
only authenticate and don't encrypt, together with export and low-grade ciphers
whose encryption is too weak to offer meaningful secrecy. The first column
shows the cipher name, and the second shows the key exchange method.

    DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256            Kx=DH
    ...

To date, all ciphers that support forward secrecy have one of five values for
the first component of their OpenSSL name: "AECDH", "ECDHE", "ADH", "EDH" or
"DHE". Ciphers that don't implement forward secrecy have names that don't start
with one of these prefixes. This pattern is likely to persist until some new
key-exchange mechanism is invented that also supports forward secrecy.

The actual key length and raw algorithm key length are generally the same with
non-export ciphers, but may they differ for the legacy export ciphers where the
actual key is artificially shortened.

The verification levels below are subject to man-in-the-middle attacks to
different degrees. If such attacks are a concern, then the SMTP client will
need to authenticate the remote SMTP server in a sufficiently-secure manner.
For example, by the fingerprint of a (CA or leaf) public key or certificate.
Remember that conventional PKI relies on many trusted parties and is easily
subverted by a state-funded adversary.

    Postfix SMTP client does not verify any information in the peer
    certificate. In this case it enables and prefers anonymous cipher suites in
    which the remote SMTP server does not present a certificate (these ciphers
    offer forward secrecy of necessity). When the remote SMTP server also
    supports anonymous TLS, and agrees to such a cipher suite, the verification
    status will be logged as "Anonymous".

    PPoossttffiixx SSMMTTPP sseerrvveerr:: This is by far most common, as client certificates are
    optional, and the Postfix SMTP server does not request client certificates
    by default (see smtpd_tls_ask_ccert). Even when client certificates are
    requested, the remote SMTP client might not send a certificate. Unlike the
    Postfix SMTP client, the Postfix SMTP server "anonymous" verification
    status does not imply that the cipher suite is anonymous, which corresponds
    to the server not sending a certificate.

    configured to verify the destination server name against the certificate,
    or the server certificate did not contain any matching names. This is
    common with opportunistic TLS (smtp_tls_security_level is "may" or else
    "dane" with no usable TLSA DNS records) when the Postfix SMTP client's
    trusted CAs can verify the authenticity of the remote SMTP server's
    certificate, but the client is not configured or unable to verify the
    server name.

    that the Postfix SMTP server trusts. The Postfix SMTP server never verifies
    the remote SMTP client name against the names in the client certificate.
    Since the client chooses to connect to the server, the Postfix SMTP server
    has no expectation of a particular client hostname.

    been just "Trusted".

    PPoossttffiixx SSMMTTPP cclliieenntt:: The "Verified" status may also mean that the Postfix
    SMTP client successfully matched the expected fingerprint against the
    remote SMTP server public key or certificate. The expected fingerprint may
    come from smtp_tls_policy_maps or from TLSA (secure) DNS records. The
    Postfix SMTP client ignores the CA signature.

    PPoossttffiixx SSMMTTPP sseerrvveerr:: The status is never "Verified", because the Postfix
