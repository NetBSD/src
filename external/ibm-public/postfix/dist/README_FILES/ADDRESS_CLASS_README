Postfix version 2.0 introduces the concept of address classes. This is a way of
grouping recipient addresses by their delivery method. The idea comes from
discussions with Victor Duchovni. Although address classes introduced a few
incompatibilities they also made it possible to improve the handling of hosted
domains and of unknown recipients.

This document provides information on the following topics:

  * What are address classes good for?
  * What address classes does Postfix implement?
  * Improvements compared to Postfix 1.1
  * Incompatibilities with Postfix 1.1

Why should you care about address classes? This is how Postfix decides what
mail to accept, and how to deliver it. In other words, address classes are very
important for the operation of Postfix.

An address class is defined by three items.

  * The list of domains that are a member of that address class: for example,
    all local domains, or all relay domains.

  * The default delivery transport for that address class. For example, the
    local, virtual or relay delivery transport (delivery transports are defined
    in master.cf). This helps to keep Postfix configurations simple, by
    avoiding the need for explicit routing information in transport maps.

  * The list of valid recipient addresses for that address class. The Postfix
    SMTP server rejects invalid recipients with "User unknown in <name of
    address class here> table". This helps to keep the Postfix queue free of
    undeliverable MAILER-DAEMON messages.

Initially the list of address classes is hard coded, but this is meant to
become extensible. The summary below describes the main purpose of each class,
and what the relevant configuration parameters are.

The local domain class.

  * Purpose: final delivery for traditional UNIX system accounts and
    traditional Sendmail-style aliases. This is typically used for the
    canonical domains of the machine (for example, $myhostname, $mydomain). For
    a discussion of the difference between canonical domains, hosted domains
    and other domains, see the VIRTUAL_README file.

  * Domain names are listed with the mydestination parameter. This domain class
    also includes mail for user@[ipaddress] when the IP address is listed with
    the inet_interfaces or proxy_interfaces parameters.

  * Valid recipient addresses are listed with the local_recipient_maps
    parameter, as described in LOCAL_RECIPIENT_README. The Postfix SMTP server
    rejects invalid recipients with "User unknown in local recipient table". If
    the local_recipient_maps parameter value is empty, then the Postfix SMTP
    server accepts any address in the local domain class.

  * The mail delivery transport is specified with the local_transport
    parameter. The default value is llooccaall::$$mmyyhhoossttnnaammee for delivery with the
    local(8) delivery agent.

The virtual alias domain class.

  * Purpose: hosted domains where each recipient address is aliased to an
    address in a different domain, for example, a local UNIX system account or
    a remote address. A virtual alias example is given in the VIRTUAL_README
    file.

  * Domain names are listed in virtual_alias_domains. The default value is
    $virtual_alias_maps for Postfix 1.1 compatibility.

  * Valid recipient addresses are listed with the virtual_alias_maps parameter.
    The Postfix SMTP server rejects invalid recipients with "User unknown in
    virtual alias table". The default value is $virtual_maps for Postfix 1.1
    compatibility.

  * There is no mail delivery transport parameter. Every address must be
    aliased to an address in some other domain.

The virtual mailbox domain class.

  * Purpose: final delivery for hosted domains where each recipient address can
    have its own mailbox, and where users do not need to have a UNIX system
    account. A virtual mailbox example is given in the VIRTUAL_README file.

  * Domain names are listed with the virtual_mailbox_domains parameter. The
    default value is $virtual_mailbox_maps for Postfix 1.1 compatibility.

  * Valid recipient addresses are listed with the virtual_mailbox_maps
    parameter. The Postfix SMTP server rejects invalid recipients with "User
    unknown in virtual mailbox table". If this parameter value is empty, the
    Postfix SMTP server accepts all recipients for domains listed in
    $virtual_mailbox_domains.

  * The mail delivery transport is specified with the virtual_transport
    parameter. The default value is vviirrttuuaall for delivery with the virtual(8)
    delivery agent.

The relay domain class.

  * Purpose: mail forwarding to remote destinations that list your system as
    primary or backup MX host. For a discussion of the basic configuration
    details, see the BASIC_CONFIGURATION_README document. For a discussion of
    the difference between canonical domains, hosted domains and other domains,
    see the VIRTUAL_README file.

  * Domain names are listed with the relay_domains parameter.

  * Valid recipient addresses are listed with the relay_recipient_maps
    parameter. The Postfix SMTP server rejects invalid recipients with "User
    unknown in relay recipient table". If this parameter value is empty, the
    Postfix SMTP server accepts all recipients for domains listed with the
    relay_domains parameter.

  * The mail delivery transport is specified with the relay_transport
    parameter. The default value is rreellaayy which is a clone of the smtp(8)
    delivery agent.

The default domain class.

  * Purpose: mail forwarding to the Internet on behalf of authorized clients.
    For a discussion of the basic configuration details, see the
    BASIC_CONFIGURATION_README file. For a discussion of the difference between
    canonical domains, hosted domains and other domains, see the VIRTUAL_README
    file.

  * This class has no destination domain table.

  * This class has no valid recipient address table.

  * The mail delivery transport is specified with the default_transport
    parameter. The default value is ssmmttpp for delivery with the smtp(8) delivery
    agent.

Postfix 2.0 address classes made the following improvements possible over
earlier Postfix versions:

  * You no longer need to specify all the virtual(8) mailbox domains in the
    Postfix transport map. The virtual(8) delivery agent has become a first-
    class citizen just like local(8) or smtp(8).

  * On mail gateway systems, address classes provide separation of inbound mail
    relay traffic ($relay_transport) from outbound traffic
    ($default_transport). This eliminates a problem where inbound mail
    deliveries could become resource starved in the presence of a high volume
    of outbound mail.

  * The SMTP server rejects unknown recipients in a more consistent manner than
    was possible with Postfix version 1. This is needed to keep undeliverable
    mail (and bounced undeliverable mail) out of the mail queue. This is
    controlled by the smtpd_reject_unlisted_recipient configuration parameter.

  * As of Postfix version 2.1, the SMTP server can also reject unknown sender
    addresses (i.e. addresses that it would reject as an unknown recipient
    addresses). Sender "egress filtering" can help to slow down an email worm
    explosion. This is controlled by the smtpd_reject_unlisted_sender
    configuration parameter.

Postfix 2.0 address classes introduce a few incompatible changes in documented
behavior. In order to ease the transitions, new parameters have default values
that are backwards compatible.

  * The virtual_maps parameter is replaced by virtual_alias_maps (for address
    lookups) and by virtual_alias_domains (for the names of what were formerly
    called "Postfix-style virtual domains").

    For backwards compatibility with Postfix version 1.1, the new
    virtual_alias_maps parameter defaults to $virtual_maps, and the new
    virtual_alias_domains parameter defaults to $virtual_alias_maps.

  * The virtual_mailbox_maps parameter now has a companion parameter called
    virtual_mailbox_domains (for the names of domains served by the virtual
    delivery agent). The virtual_mailbox_maps parameter is now used for address
    lookups only.

    For backwards compatibility with Postfix version 1.1, the new
    virtual_mailbox_domains parameter defaults to $virtual_mailbox_maps.

  * Introduction of the relay_recipient_maps parameter. The Postfix SMTP server
    can use this to block mail for relay recipients that don't exist. This list
    is empty by default, which means accept any recipient.

  * The local_recipient_maps feature is now turned on by default. The Postfix
    SMTP server uses this to reject mail for unknown local recipients. See the
    LOCAL_RECIPIENT_README file hints and tips.

  * Introduction of the relay delivery transport in master.cf. This helps to
    avoid mail delivery scheduling problems on inbound mail relays when there
    is a lot of outbound mail, but may require that you update your
    "defer_transports" setting.
