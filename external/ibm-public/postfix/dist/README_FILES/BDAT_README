Postfix SMTP server supports RFC 3030 CHUNKING (the BDAT command) without
BINARYMIME, in both smtpd(8) and postscreen(8). It is enabled by default.

Topics covered in this document:

  * Disabling BDAT support
  * Impact on existing configurations
  * Example SMTP session
  * Benefits of CHUNKING (BDAT) support without BINARYMIME
  * Downsides of CHUNKING (BDAT) support

BDAT support is enabled by default. To disable BDAT support globally:

    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        # The logging alternative:
        smtpd_discard_ehlo_keywords = chunking
        # The non-logging alternative:
        smtpd_discard_ehlo_keywords = chunking, silent_discard

Specify '-o smtpd_discard_ehlo_keywords=' in master.cf for the submission and
smtps services, if you have clients that benefit from CHUNKING support.

  * There are no changes for smtpd_mumble_restrictions, smtpd_proxy_filter,
    smtpd_milters, or for postscreen settings, except for the above mentioned
    option to suppress the SMTP server's CHUNKING service announcement.

  * There are no changes in the Postfix queue file content, no changes for
    down-stream SMTP servers or after-queue content filters, and no changes in
    the envelope or message content that Milters will receive.

The main differences are that the Postfix SMTP server announces "CHUNKING"
support in the EHLO response, and that instead of sending one DATA request, the
remote SMTP client may send one or more BDAT requests. In the example below,
"S:" indicates server responses, and "C:" indicates client requests (bold
font).

Internally in Postfix, there is no difference between mail that was received
with BDAT or with DATA. Postfix smtpd_mumble_restrictions, policy delegation
queries, smtpd_proxy_filter and Milters all behave as if Postfix received (MAIL
+ RCPT + DATA + end-of-data). However, Postfix will log BDAT-related failures
as "xxx after BDAT" to avoid complicating troubleshooting (xxx = 'lost
connection' or 'timeout'), and will log a warning when a client sends a
malformed BDAT command.

Support for CHUNKING (BDAT) was added to improve interoperability with some
clients, a benefit that would reportedly exist even without Postfix support for
BINARYMIME. Since June 2018, Wietse's mail server has received BDAT commands
from a variety of systems.

Postfix does not support BINARYMIME at this time because:

  * BINARYMIME support would require moderately invasive changes to Postfix, to
    support email content that is not line-oriented. With BINARYMIME, the
    Content-Length: message header specifies the length of content that may or
    may not have line boundaries. Without BINARYMIME support, email RFCs
    require that binary content is base64-encoded, and formatted as lines of
    text.

  * For delivery to non-BINARYMIME systems including UNIX mbox, the available
    options are to convert binary content into 8bit text, one of the 7bit forms
    (base64 or quoted-printable), or to return email as undeliverable. Any
    conversion would obviously break digital signatures, so conversion would
    have to happen before signing.

The RFC 3030 authors did not specify any limitations on how clients may
pipeline commands (i.e. send commands without waiting for a server response).
If a server announces PIPELINING support, like Postfix does, then a remote SMTP
client can pipeline all commands following EHLO, for example, MAIL/RCPT/BDAT/
BDAT/MAIL/RCPT/BDAT, without ever having to wait for a server response. This
means that with BDAT, the Postfix SMTP server cannot distinguish between a
well-behaved client and a spambot, based on their command pipelining behavior.
If you require "reject_unauth_pipelining" to block spambots, then turn off
Postfix's CHUNKING announcement as described above.

In RFC 4468, the authors write that a client may pipeline commands, and that
after sending BURL LAST or BDAT LAST, a client must wait for the server's
response. But as this text does not appear in RFC 3030 which defines BDAT, is
it a useless restriction that Postfix will not enforce.
