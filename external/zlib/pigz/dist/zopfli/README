Zopfli Compression Algorithm is a compression library programmed in C to perform
very good, but slow, deflate or zlib compression.

zopfli.c is separate from the library and contains an example program to create
very well compressed gzip files.

The basic functions to compress data are ZopfliDeflate in deflate.h,
ZopfliZlibCompress in zlib_container.h and ZopfliGzipCompress in
gzip_container.h. Use the ZopfliOptions object to set parameters that affect the
speed and compression. Use the ZopfliInitOptions function to place the default
values in the ZopfliOptions first.

Deflate creates a valid deflate stream in memory, see:
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt
ZlibCompress creates a valid zlib stream in memory, see:
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1950.txt
GzipCompress creates a valid gzip stream in memory, see:
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1952.txt

This library can only compress, not decompress. Existing zlib or deflate
libraries can decompress the data.

Zopfli Compression Algorithm was created by Lode Vandevenne and Jyrki
Alakuijala, based on an algorithm by Jyrki Alakuijala.
