/* In alpha gcc prior to 3.4, signed DI comparisons involving constants are
   rearranged from "x < n" to "x+(-n) < 0", which is of course hopelessly
   wrong if that addition overflows.

   The workaround here avoids this bug by ensuring n is not a literal
   constant.  Note that this is alpha specific.  The offending transformation
   is/was in alpha.c alpha_emit_conditional_branch() under "We want to use
   cmpcc/bcc".

   Bizarrely, it turns out this happens also with Cray cc on
   alphaev5-cray-unicosmk2.0.6.X, and has the same solution.  Don't know why

/* Return the value {ptr,size}*2^exp, and negative if sign<0.
   Must have size>=1, and a non-zero high limb ptr[size-1].

   {ptr,size} is truncated towards zero.  This is consistent with other gmp
   conversions, like mpz_set_f or mpz_set_q, and is easy to implement and
   test.

   In the past conversions had attempted (imperfectly) to let the hardware
   float rounding mode take effect, but that gets tricky since multiple
   roundings need to be avoided, or taken into account, and denorms mean the
   effective precision of the mantissa is not constant.  (For reference,
   mpz_get_d on IEEE systems was ok, except it operated on the absolute
   value.  mpf_get_d and mpq_get_d suffered from multiple roundings and from
   not always using enough bits to get the rounding right.)

   It's felt that GMP is not primarily concerned with hardware floats, and
   really isn't enhanced by getting involved with hardware rounding modes
   (which could even be some weird unknown style), so something unambiguous
   and straightforward is best.


   The IEEE code below is the usual case, it knows either a 32-bit or 64-bit
   limb and is done with shifts and masks.  The 64-bit case in particular
   should come out nice and compact.

   The generic code works one bit at a time, which will be quite slow, but
   should support any binary-based "double" and be safe against any rounding
   mode.  Note in particular it works on IEEE systems too.


   Traps:

   Hardware traps for overflow to infinity, underflow to zero, or
   unsupported denorms may or may not be taken.  The IEEE code works bitwise
   and so probably won't trigger them, the generic code works by float
   operations and so probably will.  This difference might be thought less
   than ideal, but again its felt straightforward code is better than trying
   to get intimate with hardware exceptions (of perhaps unknown nature).


   Not done:

   mpz_get_d in the past handled size==1 with a cast limb->double.  This
   might still be worthwhile there (for up to the mantissa many bits), but
   for mpn_get_d here, the cost of applying "exp" to the resulting exponent
   would probably use up any benefit a cast may have over bit twiddling.
   Also, if the exponent is pushed into denorm range then bit twiddling is
   the only option, to ensure the desired truncation is obtained.


   Other:

   For reference, note that HPPA 8000, 8200, 8500 and 8600 trap FCNV,UDW,DBL
   to the kernel for values >= 2^63.  This makes it slow, and worse the kernel
   Linux (what versions?) apparently uses untested code in its trap handling
   routines, and gets the sign wrong.  We don't use such a limb-to-double
   cast, neither in the IEEE or generic code.  */
