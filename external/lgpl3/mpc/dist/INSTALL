                        Installing GNU MPC
                        ==================

This is for the impatient, for deeper explanations see the chapter
"Installing GNU MPC" in the Texinfo documentation (type 'info mpc.info').

0. You first need to install GMP, the GNU Multiprecision Arithmetic Library,
   see <http://gmplib.org/>, and GNU MPFR, see <http://www.mpfr.org>.
   GNU MPC requires GMP version 5.0.0 or later
   and GNU MPFR version 3.0.0 or later.

1. In the directory of the GNU MPC archive, type

      tar xzf mpc-1.1.0.tar.gz
      cd mpc-1.1.0
      ./configure
      make

   This assumes that GMP and GNU MPFR are installed in a directory searched
   by default by the compiler. Otherwise, use --with-gmp=DIR or
   --with-mpfr=DIR with ./configure (see the Texinfo documentation).

2. You should run the test suite, type

      make check

   If any error occurs, please report it on the mailing list
   <mpc-discuss@lists.gforge.inria.fr>, or file a bug at the bug tracker
   <https://gforge.inria.fr/tracker/?atid=607&group_id=131&func=browse> .

3. To install the GNU MPC library, type

      make install

   By default, the files are copied into subdirectories of /usr/local.
   You need write permissions on these directories, or pass an alternative
   installation directory using the --prefix option to ./configure.

4. You can optionally create documentation, type

      make dvi

   or

      make ps

   This requires the Texinfo package (version 4.2 at least).

In case of difficulties, please send a description of the problem to
<mpc-discuss@lists.gforge.inria.fr>.

Note for AIX users:
===================

If GMP was built with the 64-bit ABI, before building and testing GNU MPC,
it might be necessary to set the OBJECT_MODE environment variable to 64
by, e.g.,
   export OBJECT_MODE=64
This has been tested with the C compiler IBM XL C/C++ Enterprise Edition
V8.0 for AIX, version: 08.00.0000.0021, GMP 4.2.4 and GNU MPFR 2.4.1.

Note for Windows users:
=======================

There is a special file Makefile.vc for Windows, contributed by MickaÃ«l
Gastineau. This file works both for the Windows Server 2003 R2 Platform SDK,
and for the Windows SDK of Vista. To use it, simply replace "make" by
"nmake /f makefile.vc" in the above instructions:

compilation :
nmake /f makefile.vc GMP=<gmp_install_dir> MPFR=<mpfr_install_dir>

clean :
nmake /f makefile.vc GMP=<gmp_install_dir> MPFR=<mpfr_install_dir> clean

check :
nmake /f makefile.vc GMP=<gmp_install_dir> MPFR=<mpfr_install_dir> check

If you want to compile mpc with mingw in the msys shell, you might need to
add the following to the configure command (or in your environment):

LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include

In addition, you might need to give the following additional argument to
configure (reported for mpc-0.9):

CPP="x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -E"
