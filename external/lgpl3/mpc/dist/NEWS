      are over- or underflows during the computation

      infinite part and equals output variable is corrected

  - Speed-ups:
    - mpc_pow_si through binary exponentiation
    - mpc_pow_z when the exponent fits in a long
    - mpc_tan through the use of mpc_sin_cos
  - Bug fixes:
    - trigonometric functions: infinite loop due to overflow for large
      arguments
    - mpc_exp: close to infinite loop for argument close to 0
    - mpc_sqrt: close to infinite loop for argument close to 1
    - mpc_add_si: replaced macro by function, since the macro evaluated the
      same expression twice
  - Logging feature for debugging:
      ./configure --enable-logging
      #include "mpc-log.h" instead of #include "mpc.h"
  - Minimally required library versions: gmp 4.3.2, mpfr 2.4.2
