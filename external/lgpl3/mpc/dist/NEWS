    stdio.h.

Changes in version 1.3.0 ("Ipomoea batatas"), released in December 2022:

  - New experimental function: mpc_eta_fund
  - Bug fixes:
    - mpc_asin for asin(z) with small |Re(z)| and tiny |Im(z)|

      the same real and imaginary part, and the exponent is an even
      positive integer
    - mpc_fma: the returned 'int' value was incorrect in some cases (indicating
      whether the rounded real/imaginary parts were smaller/equal/greater
      than the exact values), but the computed complex value was correct.
