# The line format respects the parameter order in function prototype as
# follow:
#
# INEX PREC_ROP  ROP  PREC_ROP_IM  ROP_IM  PREC_OP_RE  OP_RE  PREC_OP_IM  OP_IM  RND
#
# where op = op_re + i * op_im,
# rop is ROP rounded to nearest to the precision of PREC_ROP
# op_re is OP_RE rounded to nearest to the precision of PREC_OP_RE
# op_im is OP_IM rounded to nearest to the precision of PREC_OP_IM
# ROP is checked against abs(op) rounded to the precision PREC_ROP
# in the direction RND
# INEX is the ternary value with the following notation:
# "?" ternary value not checked
# "+" if ROP is greater than the exact mathematical result
# "0" if ROP is exactly the mathematical result
# "-" if ROP is less than the exact mathematical result
# rounding modes notation:
# "N" is rounding to nearest
# "Z" is rounding towards zero
# "U" is rounding towards plus infinity
# "D" is rounding towards minus infinity
# Use prefixes "0b" for values in base two, "0x" for values in base sixteen,
#   no prefix for value in base ten.
# In all bases, "nan" is NaN, "inf" is infinity;
# The sign of the result is checked with "+inf", "-inf", "-0", or "+0".
