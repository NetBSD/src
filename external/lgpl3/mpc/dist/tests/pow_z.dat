# The line format respects the parameter order in function prototype as

# INEX_RE INEX_IM PREC_ROP_RE  ROP_RE  PREC_ROP_IM  ROP_IM  PREC_OP1_RE  OP1_RE  PREC_OP1_IM  OP1_IM  OP2  RND_RE  RND_IM
#
# where op1 = op1_re + i * op1_im, rop = rop_re + i * rop_im,
# The data are read from the file and stored in variables op1, op2, rop using
# rounding to nearest when needed, for instance: rop_re is ROP_RE rounded to
# nearest to the precision of PREC_ROP_RE.
# ROP_RE is checked against Re(op1^op2) rounded to the precision PREC_ROP_RE
#   in the direction RND_RE
# ROP_IM is checked against Im(op1^op2) rounded to the precision PREC_ROP_IM
#   in the direction RND_IM
# INEX_RE is the ternary value for the real part with the following notation:
# "?" ternary value not checked
# "+" if ROP_RE is greater than the exact mathematical result
# "0" if ROP_RE is exactly the mathematical result
# "-" if ROP_RE is less than the exact mathematical result
# (m.m. INEX_IM)
# rounding modes notation:
# "N" is rounding to nearest
# "Z" is rounding towards zero
# "U" is rounding towards plus infinity
# "D" is rounding towards minus infinity
# Use prefixes "0b" for values in base two, "0x" for values in base sixteen,
#   no prefix for value in base ten.
# In all bases, "nan" is NaN, "inf" is infinity;
# The sign of the result is checked with "+inf", "-inf", "-0", or "+0".
