/* Each block allocated is a separate malloc, for the benefit of a redzoning
   malloc debugger during development or when bug hunting.

   Sizes passed when reallocating or freeing are checked (the default
   routines don't care about these).

   Memory leaks are checked by requiring that all blocks have been freed
   when tests_memory_end() is called.  Test programs must be sure to have
   "clear"s for all temporary variables used.  */

/* Note about error messages
   -------------------------
   Error messages in MPFR are usually written to stdout. However, those
   coming from the memory allocator need to be written to stderr in order
   to be visible when the standard output is redirected, e.g. in the tests
   of I/O functions (like tprintf). For consistency, all error messages in
   this file should be written to stderr. */

/* The memory limit can be changed with the MPFR_TESTS_MEMORY_LIMIT
   environment variable. This is normally not necessary (a failure
   would mean a bug), thus not recommended, for "make check". But
   some test programs can take arguments for particular tests, which
   may need more memory. This variable is exported, so that such
   programs may also change the memory limit. */
