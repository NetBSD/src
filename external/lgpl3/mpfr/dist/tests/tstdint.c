/* One of the goals of this test is to detect potential issues with the
 * following case in user code:
 *
 * #include <some_lib.h>
 * #include <stdint.h>
 * #define MPFR_USE_INTMAX_T
 * #include <mpfr.h>
 *
 * where some_lib.h has "#include <mpfr.h>". So, the mpfr.h header file
 * is included multiple times, a first time without <stdint.h> before,
 * and a second time with <stdint.h> support. We need to make sure that
 * the second inclusion is not a no-op due to some #include guard. This
 * was fixed in r7320.
 *
 * With mini-gmp, mpfr-impl.h is included first, but this should not
 * affect this test.
 *
 * Note: If _MPFR_EXP_FORMAT == 4 (which is never the case by default),
 * a part of the above check is not done because <stdint.h> is included
 * before the first mpfr.h inclusion (see above).
 *
 * Moreover, assuming that this test is run on a platform that has
 * <stdint.h> (most platforms do nowadays), without mini-gmp, this
 * test also allows one to detect that mpfr.h can be included without
 * any other inclusion before[*] (such as <stdio.h>). For instance,
 * it can detect any unprotected use of FILE in the mpfr.h header
 * file.
 * [*] possibly except config.h when used, which is normally not the
 *     case with a normal build. Anyway, if we decided to change that,
 *     this inclusion would not change anything as config.h would only
 *     have defines (such as HAVE_STDINT_H) currently provided as "-D"
 *     compiler arguments.
