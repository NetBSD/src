  /* We do not want to use mpfr_add1sp because if MPFR_WANT_ASSERT >= 2,
     mpfr_init is used. The following test is based on the fact that
     MPFR_TMP_LIMBS_ALLOC is used in mpfr_add1 before any other form
     of memory allocation. In r9454, this crashes because the memory
     allocation function used by this macro (under the condition that
     the size is > MPFR_ALLOCA_MAX) isn't defined yet. This bug comes
     from r8813.
     WARNING! Do not add MPFR calls before this test. Otherwise the
     mentioned problem may no longer be actually tested, making this
     test useless. For other allocation tests, it is better to use a
     different test file. */
