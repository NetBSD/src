dnl AC_CANONICAL_HOST is needed by this configure.ac file.
dnl AC_CANONICAL_TARGET is not explicitly needed, but may be required by
dnl some other macros (e.g. AX_PTHREAD 29, committed on 2021-02-19) and
dnl must be called quite early in order to avoid the following warning:
dnl   warning: AC_ARG_PROGRAM was called before AC_CANONICAL_TARGET
dnl (we don't use AC_ARG_PROGRAM explicitly, but again, it is invoked by
dnl another macro, apparently AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE). This has eventually been
dnl fixed in AX_PTHREAD 31.
dnl Due to this bug in AX_PTHREAD 29, AC_CANONICAL_HOST was moved here and
dnl AC_CANONICAL_TARGET was added in r14481. However, it is unlikely that
dnl we need AC_CANONICAL_TARGET in the future; see the comments at
dnl   https://github.com/autoconf-archive/autoconf-archive/commit/2567e0ce0f3a11b535c6b527386197fb49ff172b
dnl (introducing AX_PTHREAD 29). Thus it is probably better to avoid it,
dnl as it could cause confusion. But let's keep AC_CANONICAL_HOST here,
dnl since this may be a better place than later.

dnl Older Automake versions than 1.13 may still be supported, but no longer
dnl tested, and many things have changed in 1.13. Moreover the INSTALL file
dnl and MPFR manual assume that MPFR has been built using Automake 1.13+
dnl (due to parallel tests, introduced by default in Automake 1.13).
dnl The subdir-objects option is needed due to configuration related to
dnl mini-gmp, which has sources in an external directory.

dnl Some AC_RUN_IFELSE programs need to be able to return several values
dnl (e.g., in a format detection, one for each possible format). But the
dnl Autoconf manual says: "This exit status might be that of a failed
dnl compilation, or it might be that of a failed program execution."
dnl Unfortunately, we cannot know whether a non-zero exit status comes
dnl from a failed compilation, so that the detection may be incorrect.
dnl Since failures generally occur with a small exit status, the value 77
dnl is reserved for skipped tests by Autoconf, and values larger than 125
dnl have special meanings in POSIX[*], good candidates for success are 0
dnl and values from 80 to 125.
dnl https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exitcodes.html suggests the range 64-113
dnl but note that /usr/include/sysexits.h now allocates previously unused
dnl exit codes from 64 - 78 (for various kinds of errors).
dnl
dnl Alternatively, the test program could output the result to a file and
dnl return with the 0 exit status if it could do that successfully.

dnl AM_PROG_AR is needed so that ar-lib (wrapper for Microsoft lib.exe)
dnl gets installed by "automake -i" (if absent, "automake --warnings=all"
dnl gives a warning).
dnl However, if GMP chooses a non-default mode (a.k.a. ABI), this test may
dnl fail. The reason is that GMP provides GMP_CC and GMP_CFLAGS to get the
dnl right commands to compile (and link?) in the chosen non-default mode,
dnl but does not provide a macro for the archiver (if such a special command
dnl is needed). In case of failure, the user needs to either force GMP to
dnl use the default mode or provide an AR variable for MPFR's configure.
dnl Example: on power-aix, "gcc -c -O2 -maix64 -mpowerpc64 -mtune=power7"
dnl is used, but "ar cru" fails. Solution: use AR="ar -X64" NM="nm -B -X64"

dnl Add -long_double flags? Don't use -pc64 !
dnl Notes (VL):
dnl   * With icc 10.1 20080212 on itanium, the __ICC macro is not defined,
dnl     even when the -icc option is used (contrary to what is documented
dnl     on the icc man page).
dnl   * When ICC is correctly detected (__ICC macro defined), unsetting
dnl     the GCC variable confuses libtool. See:
dnl       https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=485421
dnl   * If need be, the gcc predefined macros __GNUC_* can be disabled
dnl     thanks to the -no-gcc option.
dnl   * Now use -mieee-fp instead of -mp (ICC 13 says: option '-mp' is
dnl     deprecated and will be removed in a future release.). According
dnl     to "icc -help", both options are equivalent; it also suggests
dnl     to use -fp-model <arg> instead of -mp, but what is <arg>? Anyway
dnl     -mieee-fp solves the tset_d failure due to a negative zero. This
dnl     option has been introduced in ICC 9.0 for Linux (2005-06):
