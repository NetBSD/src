# Note: The default Texinfo rules are heuristics allowing one to get
# typography correct by default in most cases, but it is also easy to
# leave errors if one does not check the generated info file. Thus it
# is better to make typography explicit concerning punctuation marks.
# The above test checks lines ending with a capital letter possibly
# followed by a closing parenthesis, followed by one of the concerned
# punctuation marks; menu items and comments are ignored.
