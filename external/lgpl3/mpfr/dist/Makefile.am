# Warning! Do not add rules for DISTFILES files (such as ChangeLog),
# because GNU Automake will create a "distdir-am: $(DISTFILES)" rule,
# which could regenerate such files, and this is not allowed as this
# changes files from the source directory; for this reason, this
# makes "make distcheck" fail. To update the ChangeLog file, use
# "make update-changelog" or run the tools/update-changelog script
# directly.


# The ".POSIX" line is needed in particular for GNU "make", so that
# recipes are invoked as if the shell had been passed the -e flag.
# But note that since GNU Automake adds non-comment lines before it
# in its generated Makefile, this does not ensure POSIX behavior with
# other "make" implementations.

# ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS will be fully deprecated in Automake 2.0;
# AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS (introduced in Automake 1.13) is now used instead,
# but we still set ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS to avoid a warning message from
# libtoolize and in case some developer needs to switch back to an
# old Automake version.

# has modified it for some reason. But since this script is small, we
# distribute it just in case it would be used.

# Various checks for "make dist" / "make distcheck".
# Warning! With "make distcheck", neither the top-level directory nor
# the tools directory is writable.
# * Check consistency concerning -version-info. Moreover if the VERSION
#   file doesn't end with "-dev", check that the -version-info value is
#   up-to-date. Note: this is a heuristic, to detect some mistakes.
# * Check that copyright notices exist and appear to be correct.
# * Check the NEWS file.
# * Check the __clz_tab sizes.
# * Check the mparam.h files.
# * Check typography in mpfr.texi (Texinfo rules).
