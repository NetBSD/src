/* The computation of y = x^(1/3) is done as follows.

   Let n = PREC(y), or PREC(y) + 1 if the rounding mode is MPFR_RNDN.
   We seek to compute an integer cube root in precision n and the
   associated inexact bit (non-zero iff the remainder is non-zero).

   Let us write x, possibly truncated, under the form sign * m * 2^(3*e)
   where m is an integer such that 2^(3n-3) <= m < 2^(3n), i.e. m has
   between 3n-2 and 3n bits.

   Let s be the integer cube root of m, i.e. the maximum integer such that
   m = s^3 + t with t >= 0. Thus 2^(n-1) <= s < 2^n, i.e. s has n bits.

   Then |x|^(1/3) = s * 2^e or (s+1) * 2^e depending on the rounding mode,
   the sign, and whether s is "inexact" (i.e. t > 0 or the truncation of x
   was not equal to x).

   Note: The truncation of x was allowed because any breakpoint has n bits
   and its cube has at most 3n bits. Thus the truncation of x cannot yield
   a cube root below RNDZ(x^(1/3)) in precision n. [TODO: add details.]
