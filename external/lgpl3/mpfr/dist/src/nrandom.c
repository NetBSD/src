/*
 * Sampling from the normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance.
 * This uses Algorithm N given in:
 *   Charles F. F. Karney,
 *   "Sampling exactly from the normal distribution",
 *   ACM Trans. Math. Software 42(1), 3:1-14 (Jan. 2016).
 *   https://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2710016
 *   http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.6257
 *
 * The implementation here closely follows the C++ one given in the paper
 * above.  However, here, C is simplified by using gmp_urandomm_ui; the initial
 * rejection step in H just tests the leading bit of p; and the assignment of
 * the sign to the deviate using gmp_urandomb_ui.  Finally, the C++
 * implementation benefits from caching temporary random deviates across calls.
 * This isn't possible in C without additional machinery which would complicate
 * the interface.
 *
 * There are a few "weasel words" regarding the accuracy of this
 * implementation.  The algorithm produces exactly rounded normal deviates
 * provided that gmp's random number engine delivers truly random bits.  If it
 * did, the algorithm would be perfect; however, this implementation would have
 * problems, e.g., in that the integer part of the normal deviate is
 * represented by an unsigned long, whereas in reality the integer part in
 * unbounded.  In this implementation, asserts catch overflow in the integer
 * part and similar (very, very) unlikely events.  In reality, of course, gmp's
 * random number engine has a finite internal state (19937 bits in the case of
 * the MT19937 method).  This means that these unlikely events in fact won't
 * occur.  If the asserts are triggered, then this is an indication that the
 * random number engine is defective.  (Even if a hardware random number
 * generator were used, the most likely explanation for the triggering of the
 * asserts would be that the hardware generator was broken.)
