/* FIXME: mpfr_log_ui is much slower than mpfr_log on some values of n,
   e.g. about 4 times as slow for n around ULONG_MAX/3 on an
   x86_64 Linux machine, for 10^6 bits of precision. The reason is that
   for say n=6148914691236517205 and prec=10^6, the value of T computed
   has more than 50M bits, which is much more than needed. Indeed the
   binary splitting algorithm for series with a finite radius of convergence
   gives rationals of size n*log(n) for a target precision n. One might
   truncate the rationals inside the algorithm, but then the error analysis
   should be redone. */
