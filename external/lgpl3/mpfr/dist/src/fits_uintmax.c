/* Note: though mpfr-impl.h is included in fits_u.h, we also include it
   above so that it gets included even when _MPFR_H_HAVE_INTMAX_T is not
   defined; this is necessary to avoid an empty translation unit, which
   is forbidden by ISO C. Without this, a failing test can be reproduced
   by creating an invalid stdint.h somewhere in the default include path
   and by compiling MPFR with "gcc -ansi -pedantic-errors". */
