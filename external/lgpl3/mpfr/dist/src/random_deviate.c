 * A mpfr_random_deviate represents the initial portion e bits of a random
 * deviate uniformly distributed in (0,1) as
 *
 *  typedef struct {
 *    unsigned long e;            // bits in the fraction
 *    unsigned long h;            // the high W bits of the fraction
 *    mpz_t f;                    // the rest of the fraction
 *  } mpfr_random_deviate_t[1];
 *
 * e is always a multiple of RANDOM_CHUNK.  The first RANDOM_CHUNK bits, the
 * high fraction, are held in an unsigned long, h, and the rest are held in an
 * mpz_t, f.  The data in h is undefined if e == 0 and, similarly the data in f
 * is undefined if e <= RANDOM_CHUNK.

/*
 * RANDOM_CHUNK can be picked in the range 1 <= RANDOM_CHUNK <= 64.  Low values
 * of RANDOM_CHUNK are good for testing, since they are more likely to make
 * bugs obvious.  For portability, pick RANDOM_CHUNK <= 32 (since an unsigned
 * long may only hold 32 bits).  For reproducibility across platforms,
 * standardize on RANDOM_CHUNK = 32.
 *
 * When RANDOM_CHUNK = 32, this representation largely avoids manipulating
 * mpz's (until the final cast to an mpfr is done).  In addition
 * mpfr_random_deviate_less usually entails just a single comparison of
 * unsigned longs.  In this way, we can stick with the published interface for
 * extracting portions of an mpz (namely through mpz_tstbit) without hurting
 * efficiency.

   * bits through the 1/8 position need to be generated; assume that these bits
   * are 1.010 = 10/8 which represents a deviate in the range (10,11)/8.
   *
   * If the rounding mode is one of RNDZ, RNDU, RNDD, RNDA, we add a 1 bit to
   * the result to give 1.0101 = (10+1/2)/8.  When this is converted to a MPFR
   * the result is rounded to 10/8, 11/8, 10/8, 11/8, respectively, and the
   * inexact flag is set to -1, 1, -1, 1.
   *
   * If the rounding mode is RNDN, an additional random bit must be generated
   * to determine if the result is in (10,10+1/2)/8 or (10+1/2,11)/8.  Assume
   * that this random bit is 0, so the result is 1.0100 = (10+0/2)/8.  Then an
   * additional 1 bit is added to give 1.010101 = (10+1/4)/8.  This last bit
   * avoids the "round ties to even rule" (because there are no ties) and sets
   * the inexact flag so that the result is 10/8 with the inexact flag = 1.
   *
   * Here we always generate at least 2 additional random bits, so that bit
   * position 2^-(p+1-s*l) is generated.  (The result often contains more
   * random bits than this because random bits are added in batches of W and
   * because additional bits may have been required in the process of
   * generating the random deviate.)  The integer and all the bits in the
   * fraction are then copied into an mpz, the least significant bit is
   * unconditionally set to 1, the sign is set, and the result together with
   * the exponent -x->e is used to generate an mpfr using mpfr_set_z_2exp.
   *
   * If random bits were very expensive, we would only need to generate to the
   * 2^-(p-1-s*l) bit (no extra bits) for the RNDZ, RNDU, RNDD, RNDA modes and
   * to the 2^-(p-s*l) bit (1 extra bit) for RNDN.  By always generating 2 bits
   * we save on some bit shuffling when formed the mpz to be converted to an
   * mpfr.  The implementation of the RandomNumber class in RandomLib
   * illustrates the more parsimonious approach (which was taken to allow
