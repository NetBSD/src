TODO [VL, after a discussion with James Demmel]: Compared to
  James Demmel and Yozo Hida, Fast and accurate floating-point summation
  with application to computational geometry, Numerical Algorithms,
  volume 37, number 1-4, pages 101--112, 2004.
sorting is not necessary here. It is not done because in the most common
cases (where big cancellations are rare), it would take time and be
useless. However the lack of sorting increases the worst case complexity.
For instance, consider many inputs that cancel one another (two by two).
One would need n/2 iterations, where each iteration reads the exponent
of each input, therefore n*n/2 read operations. Using a worst-case sort
in O(n log n) could give a O(n log n) worst-case complexity. As we don't
want to slow down the most common cases, this could be done at the 3rd
iteration. But are there practical applications which would be used as
tests?

   1. check that the ulp of each regular input has an exponent >= MPFR_EXP_MIN
      (with an assertion failure if this is not the case);
   2. set minexp to MPFR_EXP_MIN and shift the accumulator accordingly
      (the sum will then be exact).
   However, such cases, which involve huge precisions, will probably
   never occur in practice (at least with a 64-bit ABI) and are not
   easily testable due to these huge precisions. Moreover, switching
   to a 64-bit ABI would be a better solution for such computations.

/* Function sum_raw
 * ================
 *
 * Accumulate a new [minexp,maxexp[ block into (wp,ws). If e and err denote
 * the exponents of the computed result and of the error bound respectively,
 * while e - err is less than some given bound (due to cancellation), shift
 * the accumulator and reiterate.
 *
 * Inputs:
 *   wp: pointer to the accumulator (least significant limb first).
 *   ws: size of the accumulator (in limbs).
 *   wq: precision of the accumulator (ws * GMP_NUMB_BITS).
 *   x: array of the input numbers.
 *   n: size of this array (number of inputs, regular or not).
 *   minexp: exponent of the least significant bit of the first block.
 *   maxexp: exponent of the first block (exponent of its MSB + 1).
 *   tp: pointer to a temporary area (pre-allocated).
 *   ts: size of this temporary area.
 *   logn: ceil(log2(rn)), where rn is the number of regular inputs.
 *   prec: lower bound for e - err (as described above).
 *   ep: pointer to mpfr_exp_t (see below), or a null pointer.
 *   minexpp: pointer to mpfr_exp_t (see below), or a null pointer.
 *   maxexpp: pointer to mpfr_exp_t (see below), or a null pointer.
 *
 * Preconditions:
 *   prec >= 1
 *   wq >= logn + prec + 2
 *
 * This function returns 0 if the accumulator is 0 (which implies that
 * the exact sum for this sum_raw invocation is 0), otherwise the number
 * of cancelled bits (>= 1), defined as the number of identical bits on
 * the most significant part of the accumulator. In the latter case, it
 * also returns the following data in variables passed by reference, if
 * the pointers are not NULL:
 * - in ep: the exponent e of the computed result;
 * - in minexpp: the last value of minexp;
 * - in maxexpp: the new value of maxexp (for the next iteration after
 *   the first invocation of sum_raw in the main code).
 *
 * Notes:
 * - minexp is also the exponent of the least significant bit of the
 *   accumulator;
 * - the temporary area must be large enough to hold a shifted input
 *   block, and the value of ts is used only when the full assertions
 *   are checked (i.e. with the --enable-assert configure option), to
 *   check that a buffer overflow doesn't occur;
 * - contrary to the returned value of minexp (the value in the last
 *   iteration), the returned value of maxexp is the one for the next
 *   iteration (= maxexp2 of the last iteration).
