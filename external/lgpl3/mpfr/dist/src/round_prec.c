         Then we surely cannot round when rnd2 = RNDZ, since b or b+c round to

         implies b-c >= 2^h - 1/4*ulp(2^h), and b <= 2^h + 1/2*ulp(2^h);
         since ulp(2^h) = ulp(b), this implies c <= 3/4*ulp(b), thus
         err > prec.
         For (RNDN,RNDN) we can round only when b-c and b+c round to 2^h,
         which implies b-c >= 2^h - 1/4*ulp(2^h), and
         b+c <= 2^h + 1/2*ulp(2^h);
         since ulp(2^h) = ulp(b), this implies 2*c <= 3/4*ulp(b), thus
