   This is currently equivalent to freeing the caches (and pools) since
   they are allocated with GMP's current allocator. But this might change
   in the future to avoid the drawback of having to free the caches just
   because the allocators are changed: the caches could optionally be
   allocated with malloc().
   This function returns 0 in case of success, non-zero in case of error.
   Errors are currently not possible. But let's avoid a prototype change
   in the future, in case errors would be possible. */
