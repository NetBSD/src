# The above tests should leave input in cbreak mode, switch back to
# no cbreak mode and check.  Set a timeout and input delay such that
# the input delay is greater than the timeout.  IFF we are not in cbreak
# mode the timeouts will be ignored (canonical processing) so we should
# see all the characters arrive, if the nocbreak() does not work then
# we will get timeouts and fail.
