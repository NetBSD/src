/* Test for message: argument #%d is converted from '%s' to '%s' due to prototype [259] */

/*
 * This warning detects function calls that are translated in very different
 * translation environments, one where prototypes are omitted, and one where
 * prototypes are active.  It is possible to make such code interoperable,
 * but that requires that each argument is converted to its proper type by
 * the caller of the function.
 *
 * When lint is run with the '-s' flag, it no longer warns about code with
 * incompatibilities between traditional C and C90, therefore this test omits
 * all of the options '-t', '-s', '-S' and '-Ac11'.
 *
 * See also msg_297, which is about lossy integer conversions, but that
 * requires the flags -a -p -P, which are not enabled in the default NetBSD
 * build.
