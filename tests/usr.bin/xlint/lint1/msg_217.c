/*
 * The pattern 'do { } while (0)' is often used in statement macros.
 * Putting a 'return' at the end of such a macro is legitimate, the embracing
 * 'do { } while (0)' is probably there to conform to a coding standard or
 * to otherwise reduce confusion.
 *
 * Seen in external/bsd/libevent/dist/event_tagging.c, function
 * encode_int_internal.
 *
 * Before tree.c 1.243 from 2021-03-21, lint wrongly reported that the
 * 'while 0' was unreachable.  This has been fixed by allowing the 'while 0'
 * in a do-while-false loop to be unreachable.  The same could be useful for a
 * do-while-true.
 *
 * Before func.c 1.83 from 2021-03-21, lint wrongly reported that the function
 * would fall off the bottom.
