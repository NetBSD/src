/*
 * C90 3.5.2.1 allows 'int', 'signed int', 'unsigned int' as bit-field types.
 *
 * C99 6.7.2.1 significantly changed the wording of the allowable types for
 * bit-fields.  For example, 6.7.2.1p4 does not mention plain 'int' at all.
 * The rationale for C99 6.7.2.1 mentions plain int though, and it would have
 * broken a lot of existing code to disallow plain 'int' as a bit-field type.
 * Footnote 104 explicitly mentions plain 'int' as well and it even allows
 * typedef-types for bit-fields.
