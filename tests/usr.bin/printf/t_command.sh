# The printf command to test (if not a full path, $PATH will be examined)
# Do not use relative (./ or ../) paths when running under ATF.
: ${TEST_PRINTF:=/usr/bin/printf}

# This tests an external (filesystem) printf command

# For the actual code/tests see printf.sh
# (shared with tests for the shell builtin printf

# These tests are designed to be able to be run by ATF, or standalone
#
# That is, either
#	atf_run t_command | atf-report		(or whatever is needed)
# or
#	sh t_command [sub_test]...	( default is to run all sub_tests )
#
# nb: for standalone runs, do not attempt ./t_builtin as the #! line
# added will force ATF which will complain about the incorrect method
# of running the test.  Instead use some Bourne shell compatible shell
# (any will do, caveat any bugs it might have), and run the script explicitly.
