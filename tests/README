When adding new tests, please try to follow the directory structure of
the real source tree. For instance, interfaces available via the C library
should follow:

	src/lib/libc/gen -> src/tests/lib/libc/gen
	src/lib/libc/sys -> src/tests/lib/libc/sys

Equivalently, tests for a program residing in src/usr.bin/program should be
added to the src/tests/usr.bin/program subdirectory.
