# PROVIDE: wpa_supplicant
# REQUIRE: network mountcritlocal
# BEFORE:  NETWORKING dhclient
#
#	We need to run a command that resides in /usr/sbin, and the
#	/usr file system is traditionally mounted by mountcritremote.
#	However, we cannot depend on mountcritremote, because that
#	would introduce a circular dependency.	Therefore, if you need
#	wpa_supplicant to start during the boot process, you should
#	ensure that the /usr file system is mounted by mountcritlocal,
#	not by mountcritremote.
