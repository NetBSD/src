NetBSD ?.? (UNKNOWN)

Welcome to NetBSD!

This system is running a beta release of the NetBSD operating system, aimed
at stabilizing the next formal release.  It is close to formal release quality,
but may still contain bugs, even serious ones.  Please bear this in mind and
use the system with care.

You are encouraged to test this version as thoroughly as possible.  Should you
encounter any problem, please report it back to the development team using the
send-pr(1) utility (requires a working MTA).  If yours is not properly set up,
use the web interface at: https://www.NetBSD.org/support/send-pr.html

Thank you for helping us test and improve this beta NetBSD release.
