#

# Disk geometry and partition layout tables. 
# Key:
#	dt	controller type
#	ty	type of disk (fixed, removeable, simulated)
#	d[0-4]	drive-type-dependent parameters
#	ns	#sectors/track
#	nt	#tracks/cylinder
#	nc	#cylinders/disk
#	sc	#sectors/cylinder, nc*nt default
#	su	#sectors/unit, sc*nc default
#	se	sector size, DEV_BSIZE default
#	rm	rpm, 3600 default
#	sf	supports bad144-style bad sector forwarding
#	sk	sector skew per track, default 0
#	cs	sector skew per cylinder, default 0
#	hs	headswitch time, default 0
#	ts	one-cylinder seek time, default 0
#	il	sector interleave (n:1), 1 default
#	bs	boot block size, default BBSIZE
#	sb	superblock size, default SBSIZE
#	o[a-h]	partition offsets in sectors
#	p[a-h]	partition sizes in sectors
#	b[a-h]	partition block sizes in bytes
#	f[a-h]	partition fragment sizes in bytes
#	t[a-h]	partition types (filesystem, swap, etc)
#	b[0-1]	primary and secondary bootstraps, optional
#
# All partition sizes contain space for bad sector tables unless
# the device drivers fail to support this. Smaller disks may
# not have all partitions and all disks have no defaults for
# the `h' partition. The strategy here is that `a' always
# has the same amount for all disks (currently 65536 sectors or 32megs).
# The `b' partition is approx 48 megs while `c' is always the entire disk.
# The sum of `d', `e', and `f' is equal to `g' which is everything else.
