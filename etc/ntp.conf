# NetBSD default Network Time Protocol (NTP) configuration file for ntpd

# This file is intended to be both a usable default, and a Quick-Start
# Guide. The directives and options listed here are not at all complete.
# A great deal of additional documentation, including links to FAQS and
# other guides, may be found on the official NTP web site, in particular
#
#	http://www.ntp.org/documentation.html

# Process ID file, so that the daemon can be signalled from scripts

# The correction calculated by ntpd(8) for the local system clock's
# drift is stored here.

# Suppress the syslog(3) message for each peer synchronization change.

# This will help minimize disruptions due to network congestion. Don't
# do this if you configure only one server!

# Hereafter should be "server" or "peer" statements to configure other
# hosts to exchange NTP packets with. Peers should be selected in such
# a way that the network path to them is symmetric (that is, the series
# of links and routers used to get to the peer is the same one that the
# peer uses to get back. NTP assumes such symmetry in its network delay
# calculation. NTP will apply an incorrect adjustment to timestamps
# received from the peer if the path is not symmetric. This can result
# in clock skew (your system clock being maintained consistently wrong
# by a certain amount).
#
# The best way to select symmetric peers is to make sure that the
# network path to them is as short as possible (this reduces the chance
# that there is more than one network path between you and your peer).
# You can measure these distances with the traceroute(8)  program. The
# best place to start looking for NTP peers for your system is within
# your own network, or at your Internet Service Provider (ISP).
#
# Ideally, you should select at least three other systems to talk NTP
# with, for an "what I tell you three times is true" effect.

# Public servers from the pool.ntp.org project. Volunteer's servers
# are dynamically assigned to the CNAMES below via DNS round-robin.
# The pool.ntp.org project needs more volunteers! The only criteria to
# join are a nailed-up connection and a static IP address. For details,
# see the web page:
#
#	http://www.pool.ntp.org/join.html
#

# Depending on the vagaries of DNS can occasionally pull in the same
# server twice. The following CNAMES are guaranteed to be disjoint, at
# least over some short interval. The following servers are allocated
# to the NetBSD project.
