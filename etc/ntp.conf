# NetBSD default Network Time Protocol (NTP) configuration file for ntpd

# This file is intended to be both a usable default, and a Quick-Start
# Guide. The directives and options listed here are not at all complete.
# A great deal of additional documentation, including links to FAQS and
# other guides, may be found on the official NTP web site, in particular

# Process ID file, so that the daemon can be signalled from scripts

# The correction calculated by ntpd(8) for the local system clock's
# drift is stored here.

driftfile	/var/db/ntp.drift

# Suppress the syslog(3) message for each peer synchronization change.

logconfig	-syncstatus

# Refuse to set the local clock if there are too few good peers or servers.
# This may help minimize disruptions due to network congestion. Don't
# do this if you configure only one server!

# Some of the more common keywords are:
#   ignore      Deny packets of all kinds.
#   kod         Send "kiss-o'-death" packets if clients exceed rate
#               limits.
#   nomodify    Deny attempts to modify the state of the server via
#               ntpq or ntpdc queries.
#   noquery     Deny all ntpq and ntpdc queries.  Does not affect time
#               synchronisation.
#   nopeer      Prevent establishing new peer associations.
#               Does not affect peers configured using "peer" lines.
#               Does not affect client/server time synchronisation.
#   noserve     Deny all time synchronisation.  Does not affect ntpq or
#               ntpdc queries.
#   notrap      Deny the trap subset of the ntpdc control message protocol.
#   notrust     Deny packets that are not cryptographically authenticated.
#
# By default, allow client/server time exchange without prior
# arrangement, but deny configuration changes, queries, and peer
# associations that were not explicitly configured.
#

# for advice.
#
# Peers or servers should be selected in such a way that the network
# path to them is short, uncongested, and symmetric (that is, the series
# of links and routers used to get to the peer is the same one that
# the peer uses to get back).  The best place to start looking for NTP
# peers for your system is within your own network, or at your Internet
# Service Provider (ISP).
#
# Ideally, you should select at least three other systems to talk NTP
# with, for an "what I tell you three times is true" effect.

# The pool.ntp.org project coordinates public time servers provided by
# volunteers.  See <http://www.pool.ntp.org>.  The *.netbsd.pool.ntp.org
# servers are intended to be used by default on NetBSD hosts, but
# servers that are closer to you are likely to be better.  Consider
# using servers specific to your country, a nearby country, or your
# continent.
#
# The pool.ntp.org project needs more volunteers! The only criteria to
# join are a nailed-up connection and a static IP address. For details,
