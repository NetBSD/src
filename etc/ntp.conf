# NetBSD default Network Time Protocol (NTP) configuration file for ntpd

# This file is intended to be both a usable default, and a Quick-Start
# Guide. The directives and options listed here are not at all complete.
# A great deal of additional documentation, including links to FAQS and
# other guides, may be found on the official NTP web site, in particular
#
#	http://www.ntp.org/documentation.html

# Process ID file, so that the daemon can be signalled from scripts

pidfile		/var/run/ntpd.pid

# The correction calculated by ntpd(8) for the local system clock's
# drift is stored here.

driftfile	/var/db/ntp.drift

# Suppress the syslog(3) message for each peer synchronization change.

logconfig	-syncstatus

# Refuse to set the local clock if there are too few good peers or servers.
# This may help minimize disruptions due to network congestion. Don't
# do this if you configure only one server!

# Some of the more common keywords are:
#   ignore      Deny packets of all kinds.
#   kod         Send "kiss-o'-death" packets if clients exceed rate
#               limits.
#   nomodify    Deny attempts to modify the state of the server via
#               ntpq or ntpdc queries.
#   noquery     Deny all ntpq and ntpdc queries.  Does not affect time
#               synchronisation.
#   nopeer      Prevent establishing an new peer association.
#               Does not affect preconfigured peer associations.
#               Does not affect client/server time synchronisation.
#   noserve     Deny all time synchronisation.  Does not affect ntpq or
#               ntpdc queries.
#   notrap      Deny the trap subset of the ntpdc control message protocol.
#   notrust     Deny packets that are not cryptographically authenticated.
#
# By default, either deny everything, or allow client/server time exchange
# but deny configuration changes, queries, and peer associations that were not
# explicitly configured.
# (Uncomment one of the following "restrict default" lines.)
#
#restrict default ignore
restrict default kod nopeer noquery

# Fewer restrictions for the local subnet.
# (Uncomment and adjust as appropriate.)
#
#restrict 192.0.2.0 mask 255.255.255.0 kod nomodify notrap nopeer
#restrict 2001:db8:: mask ffff:ffff::  kod nomodify notrap nopeer

# No restrictions for localhost.
#
restrict 127.0.0.1
restrict ::1

# Hereafter should be "server" or "peer" statements to configure other
# hosts to exchange NTP packets with.
#
# See <http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/DesigningYourNTPNetwork>
# and <http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/SelectingOffsiteNTPServers>
# for advice.
#
# Peers should be selected in such a way that the network path to them
# is short, uncongested, and symmetric (that is, the series of links
# and routers used to get to the peer is the same one that the peer
# uses to get back).  The best place to start looking for NTP peers for
# your system is within your own network, or at your Internet Service
# Provider (ISP).
#
# Ideally, you should select at least three other systems to talk NTP
# with, for an "what I tell you three times is true" effect.

# The pool.ntp.org project coordinates public time servers provided by
# volunteers.  See <http://www.pool.ntp.org>.  The *.netbsd.pool.ntp.org
# servers are intended to be used by default on NetBSD hosts, but
# servers that are closer to you are likely to be better.  Consider
# using servers specific to your country, a nearby country, or your
# continent.
#
# The pool.ntp.org project needs more volunteers! The only criteria to
# join are a nailed-up connection and a static IP address. For details,
