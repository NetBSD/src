# NetBSD default Network Time Protocol (NTP) configuration file for ntpd

# This file is intended to be both a usable default, and a Quick-Start
# Guide. The directives and options listed here are not at all complete.
# A great deal of additional documentation, including links to FAQS and
# other guides, may be found on the official NTP web site, in particular

# The correction calculated by ntpd(8) for the local system clock's

# Refuse to set the local clock if there are too few good peers or servers.
# This may help minimize disruptions due to network congestion. Don't
# do this if you configure only one server!

# Set the target and limit for adding servers configured via pool statements
# or discovered dynamically via mechanisms such as broadcast and manycast.
# Ntpd automatically adds maxclock-1 servers from configured pools, and may
# add as many as maxclock*2 if necessary to ensure that at least minclock
# servers are providing good consistent time.

# Some of the more common keywords are:
#   ignore      Deny packets of all kinds.
#   limited     Deny time service if the packet violates the rate limits
#               established by the discard command. Does not affect ntpq or
#               ntpdc queries.
#   kod         Send "kiss-o'-death" packets if clients exceed rate limits.
#               No affect without the limited flag.
#   nomodify    Deny attempts to modify the state of the server via ntpq or
#               ntpdc queries.
#   noquery     Deny all ntpq and ntpdc queries.  Does not affect time
#               synchronisation.
#   nopeer      Prevent establishing new peer associations.
#               Does not affect peers configured using "peer" lines.
#               Does not affect client/server time synchronisation.
#   noserve     Deny all time synchronisation.  Does not affect ntpq or
#               ntpdc queries.
#   notrap      Deny the trap subset of the ntpdc control message protocol.
#   notrust     Deny packets that are not cryptographically authenticated.
#
# By default, allow client/server time exchange without prior
# arrangement, but deny configuration changes, queries, and peer
# associations that were not explicitly configured.

#
# Peers or servers should be selected in such a way that the network
# path to them is short, uncongested, and symmetric (that is, the series
# of links and routers used to get to the peer is the same one that
# the peer uses to get back).  The best place to start looking for NTP
# peers for your system is within your own network, or at your Internet
# Service Provider (ISP).
#
# Ideally, you should select at least three other systems to talk NTP
# with, for an "what I tell you three times is true" effect.

# The pool.ntp.org project coordinates public time servers provided by
# volunteers.  See <http://www.pool.ntp.org>.  The *.netbsd.pool.ntp.org
# servers are intended to be used by default on NetBSD hosts.
#
# The following pool statement will give you a random set of NTP servers
# geographically close to you.  A single pool statement adds multiple
# servers from the pool, according to the tos minclock/maxclock targets.
# The "2" host is used to obtain both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
#
# The pool.ntp.org project needs more volunteers! The only criteria to
# join are a nailed-up connection and a static IP address. For details,
# see the web page <http://www.pool.ntp.org/join.html>
