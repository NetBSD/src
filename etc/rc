# We have to deal with the following constraints:
#
#  * There may be no writable file systems early in the boot, so
#    any use of temporary files would be problematic.
#
#  * Scripts run during the boot may clear /tmp and/var/run, so even
#    if they are writable, using those directories too early may be
#    problematic.  We assume that it's safe to write to our log file
#    after the mountcritlocal script has run.
#
#  * /usr/bin/tee cannot be used because the /usr file system may not
#    be mounted early in the boot.
#
#  * All calls to the rc_log_message and rc_log_flush functions must be
#    from the same subshell, otherwise the use of a shell variable to
#    buffer log messages will fail.
