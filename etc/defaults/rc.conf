# sendmail can now be run either as a suid root binary or as a sgid
# smmsp binary.  In the former case, you must not have the file
# /etc/mail/submit.cf, otherwise sendmail will behave as if it was
# sgid.  This can result in mail not being delivered.  You must also
# manually set the owner and mode on the sendmail binary.
#
# The smmsp process is a sendmail helper that periodically flushes the
# "client" queue in the sgid case.  If you are using sendmail as a
# suid root program, then smmsp is not needed.
#
# The default setting for sendmail here is NO, but gets re-examined by
# the rc.d/sendmail startup script when it runs.  The script sets
# _rc_d_sendmail to "check", and then causes all rc.conf settings to
# be re-evaluated.  If the value of $sendmail after this is "check",
# the script then checks to see if any changes have been made to the
# default mailer configuration.  If no changes are detected, the value
# of $sendmail is set to YES to cause the sendmail daemon to be
# started.  This is so that local processes can send mail without it
# getting left in the submission queue.  Changes are defined as any of
# the following:
#
#	* path to sendmail in mailer.conf is different
#	* sendmail not found at the default path
#	* sendmail_suidroot is yes
#	* if the binary is not sgid to smmsp
#
# If $sendmail is set to YES or NO in /etc/rc.conf, these checks are
# skipped.
