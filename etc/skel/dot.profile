# Set your editor. Default to explicitly setting vi, as otherwise some
# software will run ed and other software will fail. Can be set to
# emacs or nano or whatever other editor you may prefer, but of course
# those editors must be installed before you can use them.

# VISUAL sets the "visual" editor, i.e., vi rather than ed, which if
# set will be run by preference to $EDITOR by some software. It is
# mostly historical and usually does not need to be set.

# Set the pager. This is used by, among other things, man(1) for
# showing man pages. The default is "more". Another reasonable choice
# (included with the system by default) is "less".

# Set your default printer, if desired.
#export PRINTER=change-this-to-a-printer
