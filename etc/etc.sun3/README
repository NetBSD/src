NOTE: THESE INSTRUCTIONS MAY CHANGE WITH EACH SNAPSHOT.

How to set up your NFS server so your Sun3 can boot NetBSD from it:

1.  Get the Ethernet address of the client.  (It is printed on
    the console when you power-up the machine.)  Add an entry to
    the /etc/ethers file so rarpd(8) will know about the client.

2.  Assign an IP address for the machine.  Add it to /etc/hosts
    (or the DNS or YP database on the server)

3.  Find a copy of the SunOS diskless boot program and copy it into
    your /tftpboot directory; then make a link...
	cd /tftpboot
	cp -p /usr/kvm/stand/boot.sun3 .
	ln -s boot.sun3 C0E914C3.SUN3
    where the link basename is the client IP address in hex.

4.  Add the client to your bootparams database.  In /etc/bootparams:
	client	root=server:/export/client/root \
		swap=server:/export/client/swap

5.  Create the directory hierarchies on your NFS server.  First, put
    the *.tar.gz files someplace where they can be read.  Then:

	# Once per server:
	cd /export
	mkdir netbsd.sun3
	cd    netbsd.sun3
	TARDIR=/somewhere	# (where to find *.tar.gz)
	sh install.sh		# (unpacks *.tar.gz here)

	# Once per client:
	cd /export
	mkdir client client/root
	dd if=/dev/zero of=client/swap bs=8k count=1024
	cd client/root
	mkdir bin sbin
	(cd ../../netbsd.sun3 ; tar cf - dev etc var) | tar xvf -
	(cd ../../netbsd.sun3/bin  ; ln * /export/client/root/bin)
	(cd ../../netbsd.sun3/sbin ; ln * /export/client/root/sbin)
	(cd dev ; sh MAKEDEV)
	cp -p ../../netbsd.sun3/netbsd.dl60 netbsd
	ln -s netbsd vmunix

6.  Customize the following files in /export/client/root:
	cp etc/fstab.nfs etc/fstab
	cp /etc/hosts etc/hosts
	echo client > etc/myname
	echo client > etc/hostname.le0

7.  Export the above.  On sunos, /etc/exports needs:
	/export/netbsd.sun3/usr -ro
	/export/client -rw=client,root=client

Booting a Sun3/60 client:

Tell the PROM to boot from Ethernet, i.e.

	> b le()

To make the above permanent do:
Under SunOS: "eeprom bootdev=le(0,0,0)"
In the PROM: "q???" (see PROM manual)

The kernel is currently "hot-wired" to do a breakpoint into DDB
and force a single-user shell.  To continue from DDB do:

db> cont

Then, to go multi user, do:

	# mount -u /
	# exit

Please let me know of any errors in these instructions.
Good luck!
