# Sample fstab for IDE disk based system
# see fstab(5) for details on what the fields mean
# Notes:
# All swap devices are now configured by swapctl(8), so a swap entry
# is now needed for all swap partitions so that the "swapctl -A" in
# /etc/rc will find them, or you will have no swap space.
# /tmp is on a 10M mfs partition; see mount_mfs(8) for details.
# the CD-ROM entry is commented out because IDE controller based
# machines often do not have SCSI CD devices.
