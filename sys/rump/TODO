	$NetBSD: TODO,v 1.7.6.1 2011/06/06 09:10:04 jruoho Exp $

* fix the build structure to work better on non-NetBSD
  = available in pkgsrc/misc/rump
* figure out how to handle mount parameters in fs-independent
  fashion (requires kernel changes)
  = generic fs-mounting, GSoC 2009
* integrate build framework with config(1) to stop the need to
  maintain a separate build infrastructure.  the remaining step
  is to rewrite the Makefiles to use  source file lists generated
  with config(1) (where possible)
  + this will also benefit kernel modules
* find a better solution for rumpdefs.h, the sed "solution"
  doesn't really scale nicely
* make rumpuser interface fully portable
  + get rid of all non-standard binary types
  + limit use of ioctl
* the .a semantics do not make sense for rump components.
  additionally, they cannot be loaded as modules since they are
  ar's instead of elf objects.  make the build produce and use elf
  objects instead of archives
* cleanup remaining uses of __ in the kernel
