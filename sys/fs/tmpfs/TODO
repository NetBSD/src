- File meta-data is stored using memory pools.  These use, at the moment,
  wired kernel memory, which is not acceptable because it is easy to turn
  the system unstable by exhausting it.  Therefore, a pool allocator that
  uses anonymous memory has to be written.

- Verify that file holes work (they should, but must be checked).  Add a
  regression test for this feature.

- Fix and complete code marked with `XXX' and `TODO' tags.

- Adjust code style - remove the /* ---- */ markers and use standard
  struct vop_*_args assignment into *ap with comment like:
        struct vop_link_args /* {
                struct vnode *a_dvp;
                struct vnode *a_vp;
                struct componentname *a_cnp;
        } */ *ap = v;

  jmmv: I may agree with the removal of the visual lines, but not with the
  vop_*_args assignment.  Those are very ugly and add a lot of redundancy.

- Check and fix KNOTE_* calls (e.g. missing NOTE_LINK on link(2), perhaps
  others)
