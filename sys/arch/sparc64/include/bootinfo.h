/*
 * The bootloader v1.9 and higher makes a call into a kernel with the following
 * arguments:
 *
 * %o0		OpenFirmware entry point, to keep Sun's updaters happy
 * %o1		Address of boot information vector (see below)
 * %o2		Length of the vector, in bytes
 * %o3		OpenFirmware entry point, to mimic Sun bootloader behavior
 * %o4		OpenFirmware entry point, to meet earlier NetBSD kernels
 *              expectations
 *
 * All parameters are of void* type except for vector length which is of
 * integer type.
 *
 * The boot information vector format was dictated by earlier kernels and
 * starting from ofwboot v1.9 has four entries:
 *
 *      +-------------------------------------+
 * #0   | NetBSD boot magic number ('DDB2')   |
 *      +-------------------------------------+
 * #1   | ksyms' table end address            |
 *      +-------------------------------------+
 * #2   | ksyms' table start address          |
 *      +-------------------------------------+
 * #3   | Pointer to a bootinfo binary object |
 *      +-------------------------------------+
 *
 * Kernels written for pre-v1.8 ofwboot require first three cells to present
 * in this particular order, those that rely on v1.9 and higher won't work if
 * the last pointer is not in the table; therefore, the vector cannot be
 * shorter than 4 * sizeof(uint32_t) or 4 * sizeof(uint64_t) for 32-bit and
 * 64-bit boot loader, respectively.
 *
 * As of ofwboot v1.9,  bootinfo binary object is placed right after the kernel
 * data segment end, i.e. in the permanently locked 4MB page. There is no order
 * for the data located in bootinfo binary object. The kernel however expects
 * at least following parameters to exist in there:
 *
 * - Symbol information (size, start, end; see struct btinfo_symtab)
 * - Kernel end address, calculated as true kernel end address plus size of
 *   space reserved for bootinfo binary object (struct btinfo_kernend)
 * - Number of text segment pages (struct btinfo_count)
 * - Number of data segment pages (struct btinfo_count)
 * - Array of text pages VA/PA (struct btinfo_tlb)
 * - Array of data pages VA/PA (struct btinfo_tlb)
 *
 * The last four data structures fully describe kernel mappings. ofwboot v1.9
 * and higher map the kernel with 4MB permanent pages and this is the only 
 * way to let kernel know how exactly it was mapped.
