 * System calls.  `pc' is just a copy of tf->tf_pc.
 *
 * Note that the things labelled `out' registers in the trapframe were the
 * `in' registers within the syscall trap code (because of the automatic
 * `save' effect of each trap).  They are, however, the %o registers of the
 * thing that made the system call, and are named that way here.
 *
 * 32-bit system calls on a 64-bit system are a problem.  Each system call
 * argument is stored in the smaller of the argument's true size or a
 * `register_t'.  Now on a 64-bit machine all normal types can be stored in a
 * `register_t'.  (The only exceptions would be 128-bit `quad's or 128-bit
 * extended precision floating point values, which we don't support.)  For
 * 32-bit syscalls, 64-bit integers like `off_t's, double precision floating
 * point values, and several other types cannot fit in a 32-bit `register_t'.
 * These will require reading in two `register_t' values for one argument.
 *
 * In order to calculate the true size of the arguments and therefore whether
 * any argument needs to be split into two slots, the system call args
 * structure needs to be built with the appropriately sized register_t.
 * Otherwise the emul needs to do some magic to split oversized arguments.
 *
 * We can handle most this stuff for normal syscalls by using either a 32-bit
 * or 64-bit array of `register_t' arguments.  Unfortunately ktrace always
 * expects arguments to be `register_t's, so it loses badly.  What's worse,
 * ktrace may need to do size translations to massage the argument array
 * appropriately according to the emulation that is doing the ktrace.
