 * The spitfire has a 16K two-way set-associative L1 I$ and a separate
 * 16K L2 D$.  The I$ can be invalidated using the FLUSH instructions,
 * so we don't really need to worry about it much.  The D$ is a 16K
 * write-through, direct mapped virtually-addressed cache with two 16-byte
 * sub-blocks per line.  The E$ is a 512KB to 4MB direct mapped
 * physically-indexed physically-tagged cache.  Since the L1 caches
 * are write-through, they don't need flushing and can be invalidated directly.
 *
 * The spitfire sees virtual addresses as:
 *
 *	struct cache_va {
 *		uint64_t	:22,		(unused; VAs are only 40 bits)
 *				cva_tag:28,	(tag ID)
 *				cva_line:9,	(cache line number)
 *				cva_byte:5;	(byte within line)
 *	};
 *
 * Since there is one bit of overlap between the page offset and the line index,
 * all we need to do is make sure that bit 14 of the va remains constant
 * and we have no aliasing problems.
 *
 * Let me try again...
 * Page size is 8K, cache size is 16K so if (va1 & 0x3fff != va2 & 0x3fff)
 * then we have a problem.  Bit 14 *must* be the same for all mappings
 * of a page to be cacheable in the D$.  (The I$ is 16K 2-way
 * set-associative -- each bank is 8K.  No conflict there.)
