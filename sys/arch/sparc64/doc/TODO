/* $NetBSD: TODO,v 1.47 2022/01/15 18:45:13 palle Exp $ */

Things to be done:

common:
- make %g6 point to curcpu
- make %g7 point to curlwp
- change run-time checks for cpu type to function pointers

sun4u:
- GENERIC.UP kernel hangs on v445 (missing interrupt?)

sun4v:
 - current status
     T5 ldom with 2 VCPU and 4GB  (primary ldom is Solaris 11.4 SRU30)::
       - kernel boots from miniroot.fs via ldom disk (vdsk)
	   - ldom virtual network interface (vnet) is working
	     (verified by exiting sysinst and issuing a ping command)
	   - the sysinst tool starts, disk setup is working, network configuration is working,
	     but after the selected (minimal) sets have been downloaded and installed
		 the 'sh MAKEDEV all' command hangs.
	 T2000 ldom with 8 VCPU and 4GB:
	   - crashes in /sbin/init doing an access() call where %o0 is corrupted (zero)
	   - device pci/ebus/com failes to enable interrupts (hv_intr_settarget() fails returning 6)
	 S7 ldom with 8 VCPU and 16GB (primary ldom is Solaris 11.4 SRU33):
	   - same status as T5 ldom
- 64-bit kernel support
- 32-bit kernel support
- libkvm
- ofwboot: tlb_init_sun4v() hardcodes number of slots to 64
- locore.s: sun4v_datatrap missing implementation for trap level 1
- check build without SUN4V defined
- replace relevant references to %ver with GET_MAXCWP
- pmap_mp_init(): sun4v missing handling
- replace constructs like "wrpr %g0, PSTATE_KERN, %pstate" with NORMAL_GLOBALS
- replace constructs line "wrpr %g0, PSTATE_INTR, %pstate" with ALTERNATE_GOBALS
- sun4v tsb no need to lock... per cpu... anyway...
- ci_tsb_desc->td_ctxidx: -1 or 1?
- MP support - currently bypassed in pmap_bootstrap() for sun4v
- vpci.c/vpcivar.h: cleanup FIXMEs
- interrupts not handled properly (com at ebus only...)
- mpt(4) complains: mpt0: Phy 0: Link Status Unknown
- man pages for drivers imported from OpenBSD lke vpci, vbus, cbus, vdsk, ldc etc.
- vdsk and ldc drivers: code maked with OPENBSD_BUSDMA - make the bus_dma stuff work properly
- vbus.c: handle prom_getprop() memory leaks
- locore.s: rft_user (sun4v specific manual fill) - seems to work, but is it good enough (compared to openbsds rft_user?
- openfirmware interface
    bounce handlng could need rework
      - only #if __arch64__ independent for SUN4V, as OF for all ultrasparcs is
        plain 32bit code too (and this #if only because the point below becomes
        always false otherwise)
      - only bounce if the address is >= 1UL<<32
      - perhaps apply the lock to OF calls in general, not only the bounce'd ones
        (in other words: let's protect the OF context with the lock, not
        only the bounce buffer contents).
	  - Are there any other bounce-worthy OF calls? If so, apply handling 
	    to all of them now
      - consider method used by Solaris/OpenSolaris/Illumos (look for PROM_32BIT_ADDRS in
	    the Illumos codebase)
 - platforms tested so far:
 -- qemu sun4v/niagara - reaches the point where the kernel needs to mount a root fs
 -- T2000 - mmu fault somewhere
 -- T5 - stickcmpr is not properly initialized ???
