MIPS models and architecture levels
-----------------------------------

Since this is a complex and confusing topic and there's a shortage of
information (especially, a shortage of reliable information), I'm
creating this document as a reference for people doing MIPS stuff on
NetBSD (and elsewhere).

Citations appear in []. With luck all important facts have citations.


------------------------------------------------------------
1. Architecture levels.

These architecture levels exist:

        32-bit     64-bit

        MIPS-I
        MIPS-II
                   MIPS-III
                   MIPS-IV
                   MIPS-V
        MIPS32     MIPS64
        MIPS32r2   MIPS64r2
        MIPS32r3   MIPS64r3
        MIPS32r4   MIPS64r4
        MIPS32r5   MIPS64r5
        MIPS32r6   MIPS64r6

Note that while MIPS32 is a 32-bit subset of MIPS64, each
corresponding pair of MIPS32rN and MIPS64rN are comparable in age and
properties. Later revisions (further down the list) are mostly supersets
of earlier revisions, although some exceptions exist.


------------------------------------------------------------
2. CPU models.

For vintage MIPS these are the standard models as of fall 1996 [idt96
A-198] and the corresponding architecture levels. (There were many
additional models put out by licensees or by the MIPS company itself,
which have model numbers with fewer zeros.)

	R2000		MIPS-I (32-bit)		[idt96 1-5]
	R3000		MIPS-I (32-bit)		[idt96 1-5]
	R4000		MIPS-III (64-bit)	[idt96 A-197]
	R4200		MIPS-III (64-bit)	[idt96 A-197]
	R4300		MIPS-III (64-bit)	[idt96 A-197]
	R4400		MIPS-III (64-bit)	[idt96 A-197]
	R4600		MIPS-III (64-bit)	[idt96 A-197]
	R5000		MIPS-IV (64-bit)	[idt96 1-5]
	R6000		MIPS-II ??
	R8000		MIPS-IV (64-bit)	[idt96 1-5]
	R10000		MIPS-IV (64-bit)	[idt96 1-5]
	R1x000		MIPS-IV (64-bit)

For later models than this I currently have no information.


------------------------------------------------------------
3. CPU models present in various systems.

These are the CPU models found in various systems NetBSD does and
doesn't support. This table also notes endianness; MIPS chips are
bi-endian but are wired up one way or the other on motherboards.

4. FPU properties

TBD... this is complex and messy (XXX / ??)


------------------------------------------------------------
5. Exception handling properties

TBD... (XXX / ??)


------------------------------------------------------------
6. MMU properties

TBD... (XXX / ??)


------------------------------------------------------------
7. Cache properties

TBD... (XXX / ??)


------------------------------------------------------------
8. Instruction ordering properties and hazards

TBD... (XXX / ??)

In the absence of the SYNC instruction before MIPS-II [idt96 A-172,
mips32insn 215], apparently on a R3000 you can force pending memory
writes to complete by doing an uncached read. [idt96 11-13]

Apparently also on some models but not others the state of the write
buffer is wired to the coprocessor 0 condition bit and you can also do
this by using the otherwise useless bc0f instruction (branch on
coprocessor 0 false) to loop. [no citation, I found this in passing
the other day with Google while looking for something else]


------------------------------------------------------------
9. Pipeline hazards

TBD... (XXX / ??)

On MIPS-I a load instruction requires an explicit one-cycle wait
before using the result. This restriction was lifted in MIPS-II,
with the addition of an interlock in the pipeline. [idt96 A-2]

A multiply should not be started within two cycles of a MFHI or MFLO
instruction, as an interrupt that requires restarting the MFHI or MFLO
might (will) get the result from the subsequent multiply. At least on
MIPS-I. [idt96 2-4]  I guess this is true for divides as well.


------------------------------------------------------------
10. Coprocessor 0 hazards

TBD... (XXX / ??)


----------------------------------------------------------------------
11. Deprecated/removed material.

When the exception handling model was changed for MIPS-III
(introducing the ERET instruction) the RFE instruction supporting the
old model was removed.  [idt96 A-134]

Coprocessor 3 (that is, the ability to have a third coprocessor, which
had never been used for anything) was removed in MIPS-III [idt96 A-197].

The branch likely instructions (e.g. BEQL) were added in MIPS-II
[mips32insn 56] and deprecated not long after, at least by MIPS32
[mips32insn 57] and were removed in release MIPS32 Release 6
[mips32newinsn2a 71].

SSNOP as a special NOP was deprecated in MIPS32/64 Release 6
[mips32newinsn2a 375] and sequences using SSNOP should include the
new EHB which counts as an SSNOP on older implementations
[mips32newinsn2a 174] ... and possibly SYNC/SYNCI ???
[mips32newinsn2a 394-401]

... ??

12. Conditional compilation in NetBSD

TBD... (XXX / ??)
