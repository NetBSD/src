TODO list for MP branch (incomplete):

showstoppers for merge back to -current:

 - rewrite interrupt dispatch so that multi-level shared interrupts
   are no longer broken.

 - figure out why ahc on serverworks fails to find its interrupt.

 - careful code review of all diffs from -current

 - test and fix npx on i386 (npx exceptions through ISA interrupts).

"would be nice":

 - use atomic ops to modify ci_flags and cpu_feature to avoid losing bits.

 - verify that cyrix 486 isn't blown out of the water by machdep changes.

 - verify that cyrix clock chip bug fix isn't broken.

 - make sure BSP always attaches first!

 - stop all cpu's on shutdown.

 - try out mpbios+ioapic w/o MULTIPROCESSOR

 - implement MI softint API

 - figure out why cpu time accounting screws up bigtime:

DONE:

 - Figure out why things are broken on !MULTIPROCESSOR
[2001/01/08  22:29:56  sommerfeld]
fixed three bugs; !MP kernel now comes up multiuser.

 - Sort out:
	- cpu feature probes [runs on new cpu]
	- identify_cpu() output [runs on BSP] 
	- cpu initialization [runs on new cpu];
   finish banishing most global variables containing cpu configuration 
   information to struct cpu_info
[2001/01/09  22:27:38  sommerfeld]
completed.  significant rewrite of cpu spinup required.
