 * Magic number value and checksum calculation are identical.  Subtle

 * numbers while SunOS label has cylinder number.
 *
 * It is found that LUNA Mach2.5 has BSD label embedded at offset 64
 * retaining UniOS/ISI label at the end of label block.  LUNA Mach
 * manipulates BSD disklabel in the same manner as 4.4BSD.  It's
 * uncertain LUNA Mach can create a disklabel on fresh disks since
 * Mach writedisklabel logic seems to fail when no BSD label is found.
 *
 * Kernel handles disklabel in this way;
 *	- searchs BSD label at offset 64
 *	- if not found, searchs UniOS/ISI label at the end of block
 *	- kernel can distinguish whether it was SunOS label or UniOS/ISI
 *	  label and understand both
 *	- kernel writes UniOS/ISI label combined with BSD label to update
 *	  the label block
