NOTE ANY CHANGES YOU MAKE TO THE BOOTBLOCKS HERE.  The format of this
file is important - make sure the entries are appended on end, last item
is taken as the current.

1.0:	Initial import.
1.1:	Bunch of small fixes to make boot work on most VAXen.
1.2:	Use common routines to identify CPU type.
	Set up a SCB to be able to handle clock interrupts in the boot program.
	Now timer countdown should work on all types of vaxen.
1.3:	Unify the ra and tmscp driver.
	Standalone driver for the Digital Equipment Unibus Network Adapter
	(DEUNA). This allows 11/750 owners to install from a single TU58
	cassette.
	Adopt to the RPB changes. Complete change of how network devices are
	handled. No more hacks to find bus addresses.
1.5:	Standalone device driver for DEBNx (ni) ethernet controllers.
1.6:	Add support for VAX 6000 + VAX 8000. Tweak console routines.
	Create a fake RPB if either netbooted (on machine without RPB) or
	loaded from console storage (without VMB intervention).
1.7:	Add support for loading a 2nd stage boot in either a.out or ELF.
	Add support for loading a 2nd stage boot directly to its desired
	address if possible.
	Cleanup use of u_int/size_t.
1.8:	Switch to loadfile instead of exec.  Now we can load a.out or ELF
	kernels.
1.9:	Support verbose/quiet boot.
1.10:	loadfile() update:  ELF symbols no longer need backward seeks.
1.11:	loadfile() update to avoid backwards seeks for ELF Program Headers.
1.12:	Disable slow gunzip CRC32 calculation.
