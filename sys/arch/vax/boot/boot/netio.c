/*
 * This module implements a "raw device" interface suitable for
 * use by the stand-alone I/O library NFS code.	 This interface
 * does not support any "block" access, and exists only for the
 * purpose of initializing the network interface, getting boot
 * parameters, and performing the NFS mount.
 *
 * At open time, this does:
 *
 * find interface      - netif_open()
 * RARP for IP address - rarp_getipaddress()
 * RPC/bootparams      - callrpc(d, RPC_BOOTPARAMS, ...)
 * RPC/mountd	       - nfs_mount(sock, ip, path)
 *
 * the root file handle from mountd is saved in a global
 * for use by the NFS open code (NFS/lookup).
