 * Brief description of how sendsig() works:
 * A struct sigcontext is allocated on the user stack. The relevant
 * registers are saved in it. Below it is a struct trampframe constructed, it
 * is actually an argument list for callg. The user
 * stack pointer is put below all structs.
 *
 * The registers will contain when the signal handler is called:
 * pc, psl	- Obvious
 * sp		- An address below all structs
 * fp 		- The address of the signal handler
 * ap		- The address to the callg frame
 *
 * The trampoline code will save r0-r5 before doing anything else.
