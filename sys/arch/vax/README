	TK50 (TMSCP) on Q22 bus.
		Other TMSCP ctlrs may also work, but haven't tried.


NOTE: NetBSD/VAX is still a developers-only port.

I have only included relevant files from old berkeley VAX distributions.
If you want to look at other files get them from nearest ftp site with
an 4.4BSD distribution, or from ftp.luth.se:/pub/unix/4_4bsd_l directory.

We who have done parts of this is:
	Joachim Isaksson, first pmap and lots of help with gcc functionality.
	Mattias Gr|nlund, locore assembler and interrupt handling.
	Mattias ]slund, lots of help and ideas everywhere.
	Bertram Barth, bootblocks and boot routines for uVAX.
	Rick Macklem, fixed all uVAXII, tmscp and deqna support.
	Anders Magnusson (ragge), that's me, who put things together
		and wrote the rest.
