Some information and status of VAX port:

We are trying to make a more easy-to-port-to-new-vax-cpu structure than the old
Berkeley code provides. autoconf.c was a real mess! We will here try to keep 
cpu-dependent autoconfig code in ka???.c, so we don't have to bother with
those old structures. 

The file skit.c shouldn't exist; it contains all currently undefined symbols 
(even undefined pointers, bleh!) It is actually created from an awk script 
taking input from ld :) Things are taken out of there as soon they are 
implemented.

Device drivers for UDA50 and DELUA are almost unchanged from the 4.4BSD
release, and at least uda/ra routines seem to work.

Config code isn't working yet, there are more important things to fix
first :) To glue together IO devices there are a file glue.c. Config.new
just creates some header files right now.

Current state of VAX port of NetBSD:

- Some locore init works fine.
- Virtual memory starts ok.
- It may find some devices :)
- It mounts root filesystem from RA81 OK.
- It loads init and fork it to process 3 to exec /bin/sh, but 
  something is wrong, copy-on-write on stack area doesn't work...

Lots important things to do:
- Boot blocks and routines. (We currently use old 4.3 boot)
- Whole skit.c should be emptied.
- Clean the code almost everywhere from foolish printouts. :)

As base code for our work we have used 0.9b distribution. For development 
we used gas 1.35 with patches for bit instructions and gcc 2.5.8.
The kernel can currently only be compiled without -O option, because
we lacks some volatile definitions in device code. It anyway takes
about 2 1/2 hours to recompile the whole kernel...

We are developing on 11/750's with Massbuss disks, because of the ease to share
disks between computers, but have root filesystem on an RA81 on an UDA50.
In the future we have the possibility to try it out on almost all VAX cpu
types, ka730, ka780, ka420, ka630, ka650, ka8200, ka8600 and ka8800. Phew :)

I have only included relevant files from old berkeley VAX distributions.
If you want to look at other files get them from nearest ftp site with
an 4.4BSD distribution, or from ftp.luth.se:/pub/unix/4_4bsd_l directory.
