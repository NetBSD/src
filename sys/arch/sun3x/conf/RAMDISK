# RAMDISK: Root/swap on ramdisk
# This kernel is used to:
#	format the disk (not yet implemented)
#	partition the disk (disklabel)
#	install the miniroot in the swap partition

# Needs to be set per system.  i.e change these as you see fit

# Standard system options

# Enable the hooks used for initializing the ram-disk.
options 	MEMORY_DISK_HOOKS
options 	MINIROOTSIZE=512	# 256K

# Filesystem options
# May need NFS to get miniroot image
file-system	NFS		# nfs client support
# Need FFS for the ramdisk image
file-system	FFS		# ufs file system

options 	FIFO		# named pipes used during install

# Networking options
options 	INET		# IP prototol stack support
options 	TCP_COMPAT_42	# TCP bug compatibility with 4.2BSD
# XXX - Work-around for root on slow servers (insurance...)

# Note the flags on the esp entries below, that work around
# deficiencies in the old driver: (may not be needed anymore)
#	bits 0-7:  disable disconnect/reselect for the corresponding target
#	bits 8-15: disable synch negotiation for target [bit-8]
#	Note: targets 4-7 have disconnect/reselect enabled on the premise
#	      that tape devices normally have one of these targets. Tape
#	      devices should be allowed to disconnect for the SCSI bus
#	      to operate acceptably.
