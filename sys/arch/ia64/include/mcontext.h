/*
 * The mc_flags field provides the necessary clues when dealing with the gory
 * details of ia64 specific contexts. A comprehensive explanation is added for
 * everybody's sanity, including the author's.
 *
 * The first and foremost variation in the context is synchronous contexts
 * (= synctx) versus asynchronous contexts (= asynctx). A synctx is created
 * synchronously WRT program execution and has the advantage that none of the
 * scratch registers have to be saved. They are assumed to be clobbered by the
 * call to the function that creates the context. An asynctx needs to have the
 * scratch registers preserved because it can describe any point in a thread's
 * (or process') execution.
 * The second variation is for synchronous contexts. When the kernel creates
 * a synchronous context if needs to preserve the scratch registers, because
 * the syscall argument and return values are stored there in the trapframe
 * and they need to be preserved in order to restart a syscall or return the
 * proper return values. Also, the IIP and CFM fields need to be preserved
 * as they point to the syscall stub, which the kernel saves as a favor to
 * userland (it keeps the stubs small and simple).
 *
 * Below a description of the flags and their meaning:
 *
 *	_MC_FLAGS_ASYNC_CONTEXT
 *		If set, indicates that mc_scratch and mc_scratch_fp are both
 *		valid. IFF not set, _MC_FLAGS_SYSCALL_CONTEXT indicates if the
 *		synchronous context is one corresponding to a syscall or not.
 *		Only the kernel is expected to create such a context and it's
 *		probably wise to let the kernel restore it.
 *	_MC_FLAGS_HIGHFP_VALID
 *		If set, indicates that the high FP registers (f32-f127) are
 *		valid. This flag is very likely not going to be set for any
 *		sensible synctx, but is not explicitly disallowed. Any synctx
 *		that has this flag may or may not have the high FP registers
 *		restored. In short: don't do it.
 *	_MC_FLAGS_SYSCALL_CONTEXT
 *		If set (hence _MC_FLAGS_ASYNC_CONTEXT is not set) indicates
 *		that the scratch registers contain syscall arguments and
 *		return values and that additionally IIP and CFM are valid.
 *		Only the kernel is expected to create such a context. It's
 *		probably wise to let the kernel restore it.
