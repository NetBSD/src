 * The following code is copied to the top of the user stack when each
 * process is exec'ed, and signals are `trampolined' off it.
 *
 * When this code is run, the stack looks like:
 *	[%sp]		64 bytes to which registers can be dumped
 *	[%sp + 64]	signal number (goes in %o0)
 *	[%sp + 64 + 4]	signal code (goes in %o1)
 *	[%sp + 64 + 8]	placeholder
 *	[%sp + 64 + 12]	argument for %o3, currently unsupported (always 0)
 *	[%sp + 64 + 16]	first word of saved state (sigcontext)
 *	    .
 *	    .
 *	    .
 *	[%sp + NNN]	last word of saved state
 * (followed by previous stack contents or top of signal stack).
 * The address of the function to call is in %g1; the old %g1 and %o0
 * have already been saved in the sigcontext.  We are running in a clean
 * window, all previous windows now being saved to the stack.
 *
 * Note that [%sp + 64 + 8] == %sp + 64 + 16.  The copy at %sp+64+8
 * will eventually be removed, with a hole left in its place, if things
 * work out.
