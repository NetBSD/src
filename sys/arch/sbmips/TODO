NetBSD/sbmips to-do list


REALLY REALLY SHOULD ("MUST") BE DONE BEFORE INTEGRATION INTO NetBSD:

	* pass1 workarounds code should be removed (i.e. not put into
	  public libc). 

	  NOTE- no pass1 workarounds are in libc or the toolchain.
	  Remove the pass1 workarounds in the kernel at some future stage?


SHOULD BE DONE BEFORE INTEGRATION INTO NetBSD:

	* redo the softintr code.  should use arch/mips/mips/softintr.c.

	* clean as many changes off of 'stand' as possible.  the files
	  in there were the most part derived from other ports (alpha
	  and followers of that style of boot block).

General features needed:

	* SMP

	* bus.h support.

	* pci/ldt support (requires bus.h support).

	* ide on generic bus (requires bus.h support).

	* generic smbus support.  currently the 'generic' sibyte
	  code in arch/mips/sibyte knows board-specific information,
	  and is not very clean.

	* board-level configuration details.

		* swarm LEDs.

		* MAC vs. fifo

		* sync serial vs. duart.

	* fifo driver.

	* sync serial driver.

Cleanups / Improvements:

	* sb-1 cache error handler.

	* clean up ethernet driver & tune.

	* interrupt handling/routing.

	* systemsw bits should be made more generic.  possibly apply to
	  mips.

	* sbscn should be made split into a driver per channel, w/
	  the features for which that's not possible in pass1 disabled.
