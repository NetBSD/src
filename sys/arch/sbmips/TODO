NetBSD/sbmips to-do list


REALLY REALLY SHOULD ("MUST") BE DONE BEFORE INTEGRATION INTO NetBSD:

	* pass1 workarounds code should be removed (i.e. not put into
	  public libc). 

	  NOTE- no pass1 workarounds are in libc or the toolchain.
	  Remove the pass1 workarounds in the kernel at some future stage?


SHOULD BE DONE BEFORE INTEGRATION INTO NetBSD:

	* redo the softintr code.  it's fairly icky.

	* clean as many changes off of 'stand' as possible.  the files
	  in there were the most part derived from other ports (alpha
	  and followers of that style of boot block).

	  NOTE- 'stand' has not been imported to the NetBSD source tree
	  yet.

General features needed:

	* SMP

	* bus.h support.

	* pci/ldt support (requires bus.h support).

	* ide on generic bus (requires bus.h support).

	* generic smbus support, and support for our controller.

		* TOD clock on smbus.

	* board-level configuration details.

		* swarm LEDs.

		* MAC vs. fifo

		* sync serial vs. duart.

	* fifo driver.

	* sync serial driver.


Cleanups / Improvements:

	* mips cache code / pmap for coherent system.

	* sb-1 cache error handler.

	* clean up ethernet driver & tune.

	* interrupt handling/routing.

	* systemsw bits should be made more generic.  possibly apply to
	  mips.

	* sbscn should be made split into a driver per channel, w/
	  the features for which that's not possible in pass1 disabled.
