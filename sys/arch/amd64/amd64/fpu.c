 * We do lazy initialization and switching using the TS bit in cr0 and the

 *
 * 1) If there is no FPU, return and go to the emulator.
 * 2) If someone else has used the FPU, save its state into that lwp's PCB.
 * 3a) If MDP_USEDFPU is not set, set it and initialize the FPU.
 * 3b) Otherwise, reload the lwp's previous FPU state.
 *
 * When a lwp is created or exec()s, its saved cr0 image has the TS bit
 * set and the MDP_USEDFPU bit clear.  The MDP_USEDFPU bit is set when the
 * lwp first gets a DNA and the FPU is initialized.  The TS bit is turned
 * off when the FPU is used, and turned on again later when the lwp's FPU
 * state is saved.
