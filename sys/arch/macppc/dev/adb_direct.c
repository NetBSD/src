/*
 * This code is rather messy, but I don't have time right now
 * to clean it up as much as I would like.
 * But it works, so I'm happy. :-) jpw
 */
 
/*
 * TO DO:
 *  - We could reduce the time spent in the adb_intr_* routines
 *    by having them save the incoming and outgoing data directly 
 *    in the adbInbound and adbOutbound queues, as it would reduce
 *    the number of times we need to copy the data around. It
 *    would also make the code more readable and easier to follow.
 *  - (Related to above) Use the header part of adbCommand to 
 *    reduce the number of copies we have to do of the data.
 *  - (Related to above) Actually implement the adbOutbound queue.
 *    This is fairly easy once you switch all the intr routines
 *    over to using adbCommand structs directly.
 *  - There is a bug in the state machine of adb_intr_cuda
 *    code that causes hangs, especially on 030 machines, probably
 *    because of some timing issues. Because I have been unable to 
 *    determine the exact cause of this bug, I used the timeout function 
 *    to check for and recover from this condition. If anyone finds 
 *    the actual cause of this bug, the calls to timeout and the 
 *    adb_cuda_tickle routine can be removed.
