	 * For historic reasons core dumps and ptrace all use the old save87
	 * layout.  Convert the important parts.
	 * getucontext gets what we give it.
	 * setucontext should return something given by getucontext, but
	 * we are (at the moment) willing to change it.
	 *
	 * It really isn't worth setting the 'tag' bits to 01 (zero) or
	 * 10 (NaN etc) since the processor will set any internal bits
	 * correctly when the value is loaded (the 287 believed them).
	 *
	 * Additionally the s87_tw and s87_tw are 'indexed' by the actual
	 * register numbers, whereas the registers themselves have ST(0)
	 * first. Pairing the values and tags can only be done with
	 * reference to the 'top of stack'.
	 *
	 * If any x87 registers are used, they will typically be from
	 * r7 downwards - so the high bits of the tag register indicate
	 * used registers. The conversions are not optimised for this.
	 *
	 * The ABI we use requires the FP stack to be empty on every
	 * function call. I think this means that the stack isn't expected
	 * to overflow - overflow doesn't drop a core in my testing.
	 *
	 * Note that this code writes to all of the 's87' structure that
	 * actually gets written to userspace.
