/*
 * Interface to the debugger for virtual memory read/write.
 * This file is shared by DDB and KGDB, and must work even
 * when only KGDB is included (thus no db_printf calls).
 *
 * To write in the text segment, we have to first make
 * the page writable, do the write, then restore the PTE.
 * For writes outside the text segment, and all reads,
 * just do the access -- if it causes a fault, the debugger
 * will recover with a longjmp to an appropriate place.
 *
 * ALERT!  If you want to access device registers with a
 * specific size, then the read/write functions have to
 * make sure to do the correct sized pointer access.
 *
 * Modified for i386 from hp300 version by
 * Jason R. Thorpe <thorpej@zembu.com>.
 *
 * Basic copy to amd64 by fvdl.
 * 
 * i386 and amd64 merge by jym.
