 * The Sun2 enable register is the ancestor of the Sun3 interrupt
 * register.  It can't be memory-mapped (and thus be manipulated with
 * the single-instruction (read: atomic) bit instructions) since it's
 * in control space.  SunOS seems reluctant to raise SPL (maybe it
 * doesn't help?) to manipulate it, so we won't either, but that means
 * we have to also do as it does and have these bizarre functions.
