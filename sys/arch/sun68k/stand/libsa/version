NOTE ANY CHANGES YOU MAKE TO THE BOOTBLOCKS HERE.  The format of this
file is important - make sure the entries are appended on end, last item
is taken as the current.

1.1:	Initial commit.
1.2:	Changed dvdma.c and netif_sun.c in libsa.
1.5:	Merge arch/sun3x into arch/sun3.
1.6:	Both netboot and ufsboot now look for any of:
	{ "netbsd", "netbsd.old", "netbsd.$arch" } where arch=sun3 or
	arch=sun3x based on the running machine type.  Boot media can
	support both sun3 and sun3x by providing two kernels.
1.7:	Common boot programs run on both Sun 3 and 3X
	machines, with different default kernel names
	on each so shared root images are possible.
1.8:	Changed to use MI sys/conf/newvers_stand.sh & vers.c.
1.9:	Convert to ELF and use MI loadfile().
1.10:	loadfile() update:  ELF symbols no longer need backward seeks.
1.11:	loadfile() update to avoid backwards seeks for ELF Program Headers.
1.12:	tapeboot: file seek bug fixed, sun2 support added
