# XXXX pcic here because it needs to be late.  The catch: pcic needs
# to be late, so devices which attach to it are attached late.  But it
# needs to be before its isa and pci attachments.  This answer is
# non-optimal, but I don't have a better answer right now.

# PCIC pcmcia contoller
# XXX this needs to be done very late, so it's done here.  This feels
# like a kludge, but it might be for the best.
