/*
 * DIO ranges from select codes 0-63 at physical addresses given by:
 *	0x600000 + (sc - 32) * 0x10000
 * DIO cards are addressed in the range 0-31 [0x600000-0x800000) for
 * their control space and the remaining areas, [0x200000-0x400000) and
 * [0x800000-0x1000000), are for additional space required by a card;
 * e.g. a display framebuffer.
 *
 * DIO-II ranges from select codes 132-255 at physical addresses given by:
 *	0x1000000 + (sc - 132) * 0x400000
 * The address range of DIO-II space is thus [0x1000000-0x20000000).
 *
 * DIO/DIO-II space is too large to map in its entirety, instead devices
 * are mapped into kernel virtual address space allocated from a range
 * of EIOMAPSIZE pages (vmparam.h) starting at ``extiobase''.
