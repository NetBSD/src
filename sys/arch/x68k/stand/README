Primary bootloaders:
	boot_ufs/
		contains xxboot_ufs.
		It is placed in ffs's boot area and loads secondary bootloader
		from its filesystem (ffsv1/v2).
		This historical primary bootloader uses custom ffs op
		functions.

	xxboot/
		contains following variants.
		* cdboot_cd9660
			is placed in CD and loads secondary bootloader
			from cd9660 filesystem.
		* fdboot_ustarfs
			is placed in floppy's sector#0 and loads secondary
			bootloader from subsequent USTARFS.
		* xxboot_ffsv1
		* xxboot_ffsv2
		* xxboot_lfsv1
		* xxboot_lfsv2
			is placed in each specified filesystem's boot area,
			and loads secondary bootloader from its filesystem.

		These primary bootloaders use MI ffs/lfs op functions in
		src/sys/lib/libsa.

Secondary bootloaders:
	boot/
		boot is placed to / (root directory) and loads the kernel.

	netboot/
		netboot is the same as /boot except default boot device is
		nfs using network interface and DHCP.
		Currently only NE2000 based Neptune-X and Nereid are
		supported.

Other bootloaders:
	mboot/
		mboot is 0-th bootloader.
		It is placed to sector#0 (as 1024byte/sector) of hard disk
		as an alternative to genuine boot selector.  And loads
		active partition's +0 sector (sector size depends media)
		which should have primary bootloader.

	loadbsd/
		loadbsd.x is a Human68k executable and loads the kernel from
		Human68k filesystem.

Utility tools:
	newdisk/
		newdisk is a utility to create the "disk mark" for X680x0
		SCSI IPL using mboot bootloader to make a disk bootable.
