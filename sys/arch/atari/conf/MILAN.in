# Ok, the stuff below requires some explanation...
# Initially, when Atari started with IDE on the Falcon, they decided to
# swap the bytelanes on the IDE controller. So all data on the disk was
# byteswapped and all CDROM drivers had to byteswap the data to make
# this nice idea work... To remain compatible with the 'current' drivers,
# this scheme was adopted by the Hades hardware (hence wdc_mb.c). On the Milan
# however, the change was reverted. But... now the hardware is connected to
# a little endian (ISA) bus, in PIO mode this is essentially the same as
# swapping the bytelanes. The fun starts when you use the PCIIDE DMA mode
# provided by the PCI_ISA bridge on the Milan. CDROM's are OK, but the data
# on the disk is swapped :-( Now luckily, both the Milan and HDDRIVER
# developers have thought up a solution, you can make a byteswapped disk
# during the partioning with HDDRIVER and TOS supports booting from it!
# Ok, now you have to choose:
#   - If _none_ of your disks are marked byteswapped by HDDRIVER, choose
#     the MILAN_ISAIDE version.
#   - If _all_ of your disks are byteswapped, use the  MILAN_PCIIDE version
# The is no way to mix things!
