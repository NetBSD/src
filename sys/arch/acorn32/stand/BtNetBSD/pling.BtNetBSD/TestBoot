*Set NetBSD$FastBoot 0

REM Test for either ALT keys

IF (INKEY(-3) <> 0) THEN
  alt% = TRUE
  *Set NetBSD$FastBoot 1
ELSE
  alt% = FALSE
ENDIF

REM Get byte 80 from the CMOS RAM. This is a RiscIX byte that we are using.
REM bits are as follows :
REM bit 0 - configure bootNetBSD
REM bit 1 - automatic reboot required.

SYS "OS_Byte", 161, 80 TO ,,value%

REM Has the user configured a NetBSD boot ?
REM If a NetBSD boot has been configured ALT can be used to
REM select a RISC OS boot

IF (value% AND &01) THEN
  *Set NetBSD$FastBoot 2
ENDIF

REM Did the kernel request a automatic reboot ?

IF (value% AND &02) THEN
  *Set NetBSD$FastBoot 3
 
  REM Clear the automatic reboot flag
 
  SYS "OS_Byte", 162, 80, value% AND &fd
ENDIF

REM If the CMOS bits dictate a reboot then allow ALT to override.
IF (value% AND &03) THEN
  IF (alt% = TRUE) THEN
    *Set NetBSD$FastBoot 0
  ENDIF
ENDIF


REM Test for CTRL key - This does a fastconf and will override a reboot

IF (INKEY(-2) <> 0) THEN
  *Set NetBSD$FastBoot 4
ENDIF

ON ERROR END

*If <NetBSD$FastBoot> > 0 then RMLoad <BtNetBSD$Dir>.Banner
