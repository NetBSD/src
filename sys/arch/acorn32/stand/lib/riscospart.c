 * static int filecore_checksum(u_char *bootblock)
 *
 * Calculates the filecore boot block checksum. This is used to validate
 * a filecore boot block on the disk.  If a boot block is validated then
 * it is used to locate the partition table. If the boot block is not
 * validated, it is assumed that the whole disk is NetBSD.
 *
 * The basic algorithm is:
 *
 *	for (each byte in block, excluding checksum) {
 *		sum += byte;
 *		if (sum > 255)
 *			sum -= 255;
 *	}
 *
 * That's equivalent to summing all of the bytes in the block
 * (excluding the checksum byte, of course), then calculating the
 * checksum as "cksum = sum - ((sum - 1) / 255) * 255)".  That
 * expression may or may not yield a faster checksum function,
 * but it's easier to reason about.
 *
 * Note that if you have a block filled with bytes of a single
 * value "X" (regardless of that value!) and calculate the cksum
 * of the block (excluding the checksum byte), you will _always_
 * end up with a checksum of X.  (Do the math; that can be derived
 * from the checksum calculation function!)  That means that
 * blocks which contain bytes which all have the same value will
 * always checksum properly.  That's a _very_ unlikely occurence
 * (probably impossible, actually) for a valid filecore boot block,
 * so we treat such blocks as invalid.
