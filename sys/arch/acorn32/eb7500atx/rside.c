/*
 * RiscStation IDE device.
 *
 * This probes and attaches the top level IDE device to the rsbus.
 * It then configures any children of the IDE device.
 * The attach args specify whether it is configuring the primary or
 * secondary channel.
 * The children are expected to be wdc devices using rside attachments.
 *
 * The hardware notes are:
 * Two ide ports are fitted, each with registers spaced 0x40 bytes apart
 * with the extra control register at offset 0x380 from the base of the
 * port.
 *
 * Primary:
 * 	Registers at 0x302b800 (nPCCS1 + 0x0) 
 * 	IRQ connected to nEvent1 (IRQ register D)
 *
 * Secondary:
 * 	Registers at 0x302bc00 (nPCCS1 + 0x400)
 * 	IRQ connected to nEvent2 (IRQ register D)
 *
 * PIO timings can be changed by modifying the access speed register in the
 * IOMD, as there is nothing else in the nPCCS1 space.
 *
 * The Reset line is asserted by unsetting bit 4 in IO register
 * IOMD + 0x121CC.
