 * the CS network interface is accessed at the following address locations:

 * 030114f1 		CS8920 PNP High
 * 03014000 03016000	CS8920 Default Memory
 *
 * IRQ is mapped as:
 * CS8920 IRQ 3 	INT5
 * 
 * It must be configured as the following:
 * The CS8920 PNP address should be configured for ISA base at 0x300
 * to achieve the default register mapping as specified. 
 * Note memory addresses are all have bit 23 tied high in hardware.
 * This only effects the value programmed into the CS8920 memory offset
 * registers. 
 * 
 * Just to add to the fun the I/O registers are layed out as:
 * xxxxR1R0
 * xxxxR3R2
 * xxxxR5R4
 *
 * This works fine for 16bit accesses, but it makes access to single
 * register hard (which does happen on a reset, as we've got to toggle
 * the chip into 16bit mode)
 * 
 * Network DRQ is connected to DRQ5
