/*
 * Hardware interrupt handler.
 *
 * If I80321_HPI_ENABLED is defined, this code attempts to deal with
 * HPI interrupts as best it can.
 *
 * The problem is that HPIs cannot be masked at the interrupt controller;
 * they can only be masked by disabling IRQs in the XScale core.
 *
 * So, if an HPI comes in and we determine that it should be masked at
 * the current IPL then we mark it pending in the usual way and set
 * I32_bit in the interrupt frame. This ensures that when we return from
 * i80321_intr_dispatch(), IRQs will be disabled in the XScale core. (To
 * ensure IRQs are enabled later, i80321_splx() has been modified to do
 * just that when a pending HPI interrupt is unmasked.) Additionally,
 * because HPIs are level-triggered, the registered handler for the HPI
 * interrupt will also be invoked with IRQs disabled. If a masked HPI
 * occurs at the same time as another unmasked higher priority interrupt,
 * the higher priority handler will also be invoked with IRQs disabled.
 * As a result, the system could end up executing a lot of code with IRQs
 * completely disabled if the HPI's IPL is relatively low.
 *
 * At the present time, the only known use of HPI is for the console UART
 * on a couple of boards. This is probably the least intrusive use of HPI
 * as IPL_SERIAL is the highest priority IPL in the system anyway. The
 * code has not been tested with HPI hooked up to a class of device which
 * interrupts below IPL_SERIAL. Indeed, such a configuration is likely to
 * perform very poorly if at all, even though the following code has been
 * designed (hopefully) to cope with it.
