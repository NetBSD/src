     *     granularity.

     *     prevent unbounded stack usage. Whatever the purpose, we expect
     *     that the mask will be asserted only for short periods at a time,
     *     and so the likelihood of a 'spurious' IPI is suitably small.
     * The mask is read before making an event upcall to the guest: a
     * non-zero mask therefore guarantees that the VCPU will not receive
     * an upcall activation. The mask is cleared when the VCPU requests
     * to block: this avoids wakeup-waiting races.

     *     source.
     *  3. Virtual interrupts ('events'). A domain can bind an event-channel
     *     port to a virtual interrupt source, such as the virtual-timer
     *     device or the emergency console.
     * 
     * Event channels are addressed by a "port index". Each channel is
     * associated with two bits of information:
     *  1. PENDING -- notifies the domain that there is a pending notification
     *     to be processed. This bit is cleared by the guest.
     *  2. MASK -- if this bit is clear then a 0->1 transition of PENDING

     *     pending notifications as no upcall will be scheduled by Xen).
     * 
     * To expedite scanning of pending notifications, any 0->1 pending
     * transition on an unmasked channel causes a corresponding bit in a
     * per-vcpu selector word to be set. Each bit in the selector covers a
     * 'C long' in the PENDING bitfield array.
