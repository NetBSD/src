/* This file describes the Kexec / Kdump hypercall interface for Xen.
 *
 * Kexec under vanilla Linux allows a user to reboot the physical machine 
 * into a new user-specified kernel. The Xen port extends this idea
 * to allow rebooting of the machine from dom0. When kexec for dom0
 * is used to reboot,  both the hypervisor and the domains get replaced
 * with some other kernel. It is possible to kexec between vanilla
 * Linux and Xen and back again. Xen to Xen works well too.
 *
 * The hypercall interface for kexec can be divided into three main
 * types of hypercall operations:
 *
 * 1) Range information:
 *    This is used by the dom0 kernel to ask the hypervisor about various 
 *    address information. This information is needed to allow kexec-tools 
 *    to fill in the ELF headers for /proc/vmcore properly.
 *
 * 2) Load and unload of images:
 *    There are no big surprises here, the kexec binary from kexec-tools
 *    runs in userspace in dom0. The tool loads/unloads data into the
 *    dom0 kernel such as new kernel, initramfs and hypervisor. When
 *    loaded the dom0 kernel performs a load hypercall operation, and
 *    before releasing all page references the dom0 kernel calls unload.
 *
 * 3) Kexec operation:
 *    This is used to start a previously loaded kernel.
