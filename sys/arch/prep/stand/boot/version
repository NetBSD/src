NOTE ANY CHANGES YOU MAKE TO THE BOOTBLOCKS HERE.  The format of this
file is important - make sure the entries are appended on end, last item
is taken as the current.

1.1:		Boot program for IBM Power Serise 830; initial revision
1.2:		Support verbose/quiet boot.
1.3:		loadfile() update:  ELF symbols no longer need backward seeks.
1.4:		loadfile() update to avoid backwards seeks for ELF Program
		Headers.
1.5:		Support MPC601.
1.6:		Remove fd.c, video.c.  Compile without DB_MONITOR. Cleanup,
		KNF.
1.7:		Rewrite vreset.c, make it work and always run it. Stop using
		cd9660 and ufs, replace with nullfs because we don't need one.
1.8:		Do not always run vreset.  When resetting, only do the pci
		stuff when we find an actual pci card.
