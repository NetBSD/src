# FOUR_TTYS Sun3 (3/50, 3/60, 3/110, 3/160, 3/260)
# like GENERIC but both zs chips are used as ttys

include "arch/sun3/conf/GENERIC"

#
# Note that by ommitting "kdb0" and "ms0" one can build
# a kernel that operates four plain serial lines, where
# two of them are data-leads-only ports wired up using
# a custom cable on the keyboard connector.  The flags 1
# part sets TIOCFLAG_SOFTCAR (remember, data-leads-only).
# Note: the signal levels on these are 0/5 Volt TTL.

no kbd0	at zsc0
no ms0	at zsc0
zstty2	at zsc0 channel 0 flags 1 # ttyc
zstty3	at zsc0 channel 1 flags 1 # ttyd
