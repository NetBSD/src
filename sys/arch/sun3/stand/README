The sun bootblocks are split into two parts: a small 1st-level program that
gets written right after the superblock in a partition (and is hence limited
in size to SBSIZE - DEV_BSIZE bytes), and a 2nd-level program that resides
in the filesystem proper.

The 1st-level program is loaded into memory by the PROM. It loads the second
stage program from a set of filesystem block numbers that are hard-coded
into it by the `installboot' program. The prototype code for the 1st-level
bootblocks are in `bootxx'.

The 2nd-level program (`boot') is normally installed in the root directory
as `/boot'. It uses the device drivers in the PROM and the stand-alone
filesystem code in `libsa.a' to locate and load the kernel.

Use the following command to install the 1st-level bootblocks in the
root filesystem (on `sd0a') using the file `/boot' as the second level
boot program:

	installboot /boot bootxx /dev/rsd0a
