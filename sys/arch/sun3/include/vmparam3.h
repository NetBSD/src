/*
 * Machine dependent constants for Sun3
 *
 * The Sun3 has limited total kernel virtual space (32MB) and
 * can not use main memory for page tables.  (All active PTEs
 * must be installed in special translation RAM in the MMU).
 * Therefore, parameters that would normally configure the
 * size of various page tables are irrelevant.  Only things
 * that consume portions of kernel virtual (KV) space matter,
 * and those things should be chosen to conserve KV space.
 */

/*
 * Virtual memory related constants, all in bytes.
 * The Sun3 has only 224 MB of user-virtual space,
 * so we need to be conservative with these limits.
