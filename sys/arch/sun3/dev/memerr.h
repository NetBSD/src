/*
 * Sun3 memory error register.
 *
 * All Sun3 memory systems use either parity checking or
 * Error Correction Coding (ECC).  A memory error causes
 * the Memory Error Register (MER) to latch information
 * about the location and type of error, and if the MER
 * interrupt is enabled, generateds a level 7 interrupt.
 * The latched information persists (even if more errors
 * occur) until the MER is cleared by a write (at mer_er).
