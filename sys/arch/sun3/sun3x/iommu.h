 * Structure and definition of descriptors used in the I/O Mapper.

#ifndef _SUN3X_IOMMU_H
#define _SUN3X_IOMMU_H

/* The I/O Mapper is a special type of MMU in the sun3x architecture
 * (and supposedly in the sun4m as well) that translates an address used by a
 * device during a DMA transfer into an address on the internal system bus.
 * In other words, it is an MMU that stands between devices wishing to do DMA
 * transfers and main memory.  In this description, the address issued by a
 * DMA device is called a ``DVMA address'', while the address as it is
 * translated and output from the I/O mapper is called a ``system bus address''
 * (sometimes known as a ``physical address'').
 *
 * The DVMA address space in the sun3x architecture is 24 bits wide, in
 * contrast with the system bus address space, which is 32.  The mapping of a
 * DVMA address to a system bus address is accomplished by dividing the DVMA
 * address space into 2048 8K pages.  Each DVMA page is then mapped to a
 * system bus address using a mapping described by a page descriptor entry
 * within the I/O Mapper.  This 2048 entry, page descriptor table is located
 * at physical address 0x60000000 in the sun3x architecture and can be
 * manipulated by the CPU with normal read and write cycles.
 *
 * In addition to describing an address mapping, a page descriptor entry also
 * indicates whether the DVMA page is read-only, should be inhibited from
 * caching by system caches, and whether or not DMA write transfers to it will
 * be completed in 16 byte aligned blocks.  (This last item is used for cache
 * optimization in sun3x systems with special DMA caches.)
 *
 * Since not every DMA device is capable of addressing all 24 bits of the
 * DVMA address space, each is wired so that the end of its address space is
 * always flush against the end of the DVMA address space.  That is, a device
 * with a 16 bit address space (and hence an address space size of 64k) is
 * wired such that it accesses the top 64k of DVMA space.
