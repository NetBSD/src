 * Machine-dependent clock routines.  Sun3X machines may have
 * either the Mostek 48T02 or the Intersil 7170 clock.
 *
 * It is tricky to determine which you have, because there is
 * always something responding at the address where the Mostek
 * clock might be found: either a Mostek or plain-old EEPROM.
 * Therefore, we cheat.  If we find an Intersil clock, assume
 * that what responds at the end of the EEPROM space is just
 * plain-old EEPROM (not a Mostek clock).  Worse, there are
 * H/W problems with probing for an Intersil on the 3/80, so
 * on that machine we "know" there is a Mostek clock.
 *
 * Note that the probing algorithm described above requires
 * that we probe the intersil before we probe the mostek!
