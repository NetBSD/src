| First we need to set it up so we can access the sun MMU, and be otherwise
| undisturbed.  Until otherwise noted, all code must be position independent
| as the boot loader put us low in memory, but we are linked high.

| In order to "move" the kernel to high memory, we are going to copy the
| first 4 Mb of pmegs such that we will be mapped at the linked address.
| This is all done by copying in the segment map (top-level MMU table).
| We will unscramble which PMEGs we actually need later.

| Note curpcb was already set in _bootstrap().
| Will do fpu initialization during autoconfig (see fpu.c)
| The interrupt vector table and stack are now ready.
| Interrupts will be enabled later, AFTER  autoconfiguration
| is finished, to avoid spurrious interrupts.
