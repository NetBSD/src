$NetBSD: TODO,v 1.6 2000/03/03 12:32:15 soda Exp $

To do list (not in any particular order).

    o	Move the RO and WIRED attribute from the pte to the pv table.
	This saves four instructions in the tlb miss handler.

    o   Boot. Standalone boot program instead of booting the kernel directly?

    o   Find out why bitmap load to S3-928 flashes screen. (X server)
	Know why (enable linear mode). Need S3 info.

    o   Can we have 32 double registers?

    o	64bit kernel/userland

    o	repair DeskStation and Algor support

	-   64bit device physical address space for Tyne (see OpenBSD pmap.c)

	-   requires bus_dma

    o	source code structure is quite obsolete,
	general clean up is needed as nisimura-san suggested.
	especially:

 	-   introduce struct platform and remove ugly ``switch (cputype)''
	    in many places.

	-   implement and use bus_dma

	-   clean up bus_space implementation, remove inb/outb

    o	fix kernel start address

    o	merge new wscons

    o	parse ARC BIOS configuration information and use it

    o	omit __BROKEN_CONFIG_UNIT_USAGE

    o	omit __SWAP_BROKEN in <mips/types.h>

    o	fix implementation of DELAY(), clean up clock implementation

    o	asc.c scsi clock/NCR53CF94 handling clean up

    o	if_sn.c ether address handling clean up

    o	com_lbus.c clock handling clean up

    o	implement NCR 53c700(?) driver for NEC RISCserver 2200
	based on amiga siop driver?

    o	audio driver

    o	use MI driver

	-   use MI ncr53c9x driver instead of home grown asc

	-   use MI bha driver instead of home grown btl

	-   make sonic driver MI, and share it with mac68k, newsmips/apbus

	-   make fd driver MI, and share it with i386
	    (contact christos about MI fd driver)

	-   make pccons MI, and share it with i386,
	    or simply eliminate pccons

	-   LKM

    o	ARC boot device name -> NetBSD root device conversion

    o	and missing MI devices
		ses?, lkm, vcoda, ...

    o	way to specify serial console

    o resolve "XXX"

Lots of other things.....
