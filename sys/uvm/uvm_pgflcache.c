 * uvm_pgflcache.c: page freelist cache.
 *
 * This implements a tiny per-CPU cache of pages that sits between the main
 * page allocator and the freelists.  By allocating and freeing pages in
 * batch, it reduces freelist contention by an order of magnitude.
 *
 * The cache can be paused & resumed at runtime so that UVM_HOTPLUG,
 * uvm_pglistalloc() and uvm_page_redim() can have a consistent view of the
 * world.  On system with one CPU per physical package (e.g. a uniprocessor)
 * the cache is not enabled.

 * MAXPGS - maximum pages per color, per bucket.
 * FILLPGS - number of pages to allocate at once, per color, per bucket.
 *
 * Why the chosen values:
 *
 * (1) In 2019, an average Intel system has 4kB pages and 8x L2 cache
 * colors.  We make the assumption that most of the time allocation activity
 * will be centered around one UVM freelist, so most of the time there will
 * be no more than 224kB worth of cached pages per-CPU.  That's tiny, but
 * enough to hugely reduce contention on the freelist locks, and give us a
 * small pool of pages which if we're very lucky may have some L1/L2 cache
 * locality, and do so without subtracting too much from the L2/L3 cache
 * benefits of having per-package free lists in the page allocator.
 *
 * (2) With the chosen values on _LP64, the data structure for each color
 * takes up a single cache line (64 bytes) giving this very low overhead
 * even in the "miss" case.
 *
 * (3) We don't want to cause too much pressure by hiding away memory that
 * could otherwise be put to good use.
