# standard MI 'options'
#
# this file is for options which can't be off-by-default for some reasons.
# "it's commonly used" is NOT a good reason to enable options here.

#
# Always include "kern" attribute (module).  Other attributes don't need to
# depend on "kern".
#
select	kern

# Always include the "vfs" attribute (module).  Although all of the
# ufs/xxx file systems depend on the vfs attribute, it is not required
# that any file system actually be built-in to the kernel.  (At least
# on some architectures, file system modules can be loaded at boot
# time.)

# the following options are on-by-default to keep
# kernel config file compatibility.

# Kernel entropy pool and random-number generator pseudodevice.
# The pseudodevice might stop being "std" when the two are torn
# apart some day but the entropy pool itself never will (they are
