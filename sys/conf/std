# standard MI 'options'
#
# this file is for options which can't be off-by-default for some reasons.
# "it's commonly used" is NOT a good reason to enable options here.

# the following options are on-by-default to keep
# kernel config file compatibility.
options	VMSWAP		# Swap device/file support
options	BUFQ_FCFS	# First-come First-serve strategy
options	BUFQ_DISKSORT	# Traditional min seek sort strategy
options	RFC2292		# Previous version of Adv. Sockets API for IPv6 
options	PTRACE		# Include ptrace(2)
options	COREDUMP	# allow processes to coredump.
options	AIO		# POSIX asynchronous I/O
options	MQUEUE		# POSIX message queues

#
# Security model.
#
options	secmodel_bsd44	# Traditional 4.4BSD security model

#
# Scheduling algorithm
#
options	SCHED_4BSD

pseudo-device	cpuctl

#
# Kernel entropy pool and random-number generator pseudodevice.
# The pseudodevice might stop being "std" when the two are torn
# apart some day but the entropy pool itself never will (they are
# presently implemented in the same source file)
#
pseudo-device	rnd
