                           Kernel Developer's Manual

DESCRIPTION
     The kernel example dynamic modules.

     This directory contains the following example modules:
     * hello           - the simplest `hello world' module
     * properties      - handle incoming properties during the module load
     * readhappy       - basic implementation of read(9) with happy numbers
     * ping            - basic ioctl(9)
     * luahello        - the simplest `hello world' Lua module

     To build the examples you need a local copy of NetBSD sources. You also
     need the comp set with toolchain. To build the module just enter a
     directory with example modules and use make(1):

         # make

     To load, unload, and stat the module use modload(8), modunload(8) and
     modstat(8).

     The S parameter in the Makefile files points to src/sys and it can be
     overloaded in this way:

         # make S=/data/netbsd/src/sys

     The code of a module does not need to be in src/sys unless you use
     the autoconf(9) framework.

     A cross-built of a module for a target platform is possible with the
     build.sh framework. You need to generate the toolchain and set
     appropriately PATH to point bin/ in the TOOLDIR path. An example command
     to cross-build a module with the amd64 toolchain is as follows:

        # nbmake-amd64 S=/data/netbsd/src/sys


     The example modules should not be used on a production machine.

     All modules that create a cdevsw should be verified that the major number
     should not conflict with a real device.

HISTORY
     An example of handling incoming properties first appeared in NetBSD 5.0
     and was written by Julio Merino with further modifications by Martin
     Husemann, Adam Hamsik, John Nemeth and Mindaugas Rasiukevicius.

     This document and additional modules (hello, readhappy, properties,
     ping, and luahello) first appeared in NetBSD 8.0; they were written
     by Kamil Rytarowski.
