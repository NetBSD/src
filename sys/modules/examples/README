                           Kernel Developer's Manual

DESCRIPTION
     The kernel example dynamic modules.

     This directory contains the following example modules:
     * current_time    - prints current date and time in GMT/UTC
     * executor        - basic implementation of callout and RUN_ONCE
     * fopsmapper      - basic implementation of mmap with fileops fo_mmap
     * hello           - the simplest `hello world' module
     * luahello        - the simplest `hello world' Lua module
     * luareadhappy    - demonstrates calling Lua code from C
     * mapper          - basic implementation of mmap
     * panic_string    - shows how panic is being called through a device
     * ping            - basic ioctl(9)
     * ping_block      - basic ioctl(9) with a block device
     * properties      - handle incoming properties during the module load
     * pollpal         - implementation of basic poll(9) using palindrome
     * readhappy       - basic implementation of read(9) with happy numbers
     * readhappy_mpsafe- demonstrates how to make a module MPSAFE
     * sysctl          - demonstrates adding a sysctl handle dynamically

     To build the examples you need a local copy of NetBSD sources. You also
     need the comp set with toolchain. To build the module just enter a
     directory with example modules and use make(1):

         # make

     To load, unload, and stat the module use modload(8), modunload(8) and
     modstat(8).

     The S parameter in the Makefile files points to src/sys and it can be
     overloaded in this way:

         # make S=/data/netbsd/src/sys

     The code of a module does not need to be in src/sys unless it uses
     the autoconf(9) framework.

     A cross-build of a module for a target platform is possible with the
     build.sh framework. You need to generate the toolchain and set
     appropriately PATH to point bin/ in the TOOLDIR path. An example command
     to cross-build a module with the amd64 toolchain is as follows:

        # nbmake-amd64 S=/data/netbsd/src/sys


     The example modules should not be used on a production machine.

     All modules that create a cdevsw (or bdevsw) should be verified that
     the major number(s) should not conflict with a real device.

     ping, luahello and luareadhappy) first appeared in NetBSD 8.0; they were
     written by Kamil Rytarowski.

     9.0 and were authored by Siddharth Muralee.

     The panic_string module first appeared in NetBSD 9.0 and was authored by
     Harry Pantazis.

     The mapper module first appeared in NetBSD 9.0 and was authored by
     Akul Pillai.
     
     The ping_block module first appeared in NetBSD 10.0 and was authored by
     Nisarg Joshi.
