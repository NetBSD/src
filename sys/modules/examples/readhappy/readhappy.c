/*
 * Create a device /dev/happy from which you can read sequential
 * happy numbers.
 *
 * To use this device you need to do:
 *     mknod /dev/happy c 210 0
 *
 * Commentary:
 * A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with
 * any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its
 * digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will
 * stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those
 * numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that
 * do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers (or sad numbers).
 *
 * For more information on happy numbers, and the algorithms, see
 *	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_number 
 *
 * The happy number generator is here only to have something that the user
 * can read from our device.  Any other arbitrary data generator could
 * have been used.  The algorithm is not critical to the implementation
 * of the module.
