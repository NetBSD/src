 * This module is a modification of the readhappy module to illustrate
 * how to make a device MPSAFE (Multiprocessor Safe).
 *
 *  1. Supports opening device by multiple processes but allows only one at a time.
 *  2. Supports multiple read() functions but allows only one at a time.
 *  3. Uses mutex for ensuring synchonization.
 *
 * Create a device /dev/happy_mpsafe from which you can read sequential happy numbers.
 *
 * To use this device you need to do:
 *     mknod /dev/happy_mpsafe c 210 0
 *
 * To test whether the device is MPSAFE. Compile and run the test_readhappy file
 * provided.
