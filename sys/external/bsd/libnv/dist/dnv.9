.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm libnv
library permits easy management of name/value pairs and can send and receive
them over sockets.
For more information, also see
.Xr nv 9 .
.Pp
The
.Nm dnvlist_get
family of functions returns the value associated with the specified name.
If an element of the specified name does not exist, the function returns the
value provided in
.Fa defval .
Returned strings, nvlists, descriptors, binaries, or arrays must not be modified
by the user.
They still belong to the nvlist.
If the nvlist is in an error state, attempts to use any of these functions will
cause the program to abort.
.Pp
The
.Nm dnvlist_take
family of functions returns the value associated with the specified name and
removes the element from the nvlist.
If an element of the supplied name does not exist, the value provided in
.Nm defval
is returned.
When the value is a string, binary, or array value, the caller is
responsible for freeing returned memory with
.Fn free 3 .
When the value is an nvlist, the caller is responsible for destroying the
returned nvlist with
.Fn nvlist_destroy .
When the value is a descriptor, the caller is responsible for closing the
returned descriptor with
.Fn close 2 .
