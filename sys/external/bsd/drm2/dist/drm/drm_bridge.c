/**
 * DOC: overview
 *
 * drm_bridge represents a device that hangs on to an encoder. These are handy
 * when a regular drm_encoder entity isn't enough to represent the entire
 * encoder chain.
 *
 * A bridge is always associated to a single drm_encoder at a time, but can be
 * either connected to it directly, or through an intermediate bridge:
 *
 * encoder ---> bridge B ---> bridge A
 *
 * Here, the output of the encoder feeds to bridge B, and that furthers feeds to
 * bridge A.
 *
 * The driver using the bridge is responsible to make the associations between
 * the encoder and bridges. Once these links are made, the bridges will
 * participate along with encoder functions to perform mode_set/enable/disable
 * through the ops provided in drm_bridge_funcs.
 *
 * drm_bridge, like drm_panel, aren't drm_mode_object entities like planes,
 * crtcs, encoders or connectors. They just provide additional hooks to get the
 * desired output at the end of the encoder chain.

/**
 * DOC: bridge callbacks
 *
 * The drm_bridge_funcs ops are populated by the bridge driver. The drm
 * internals(atomic and crtc helpers) use the helpers defined in drm_bridge.c
 * These helpers call a specific drm_bridge_funcs op for all the bridges
 * during encoder configuration.
 *
 * When creating a bridge driver, one can implement drm_bridge_funcs op with
 * the help of these rough rules:
 *
 * pre_enable: this contains things needed to be done for the bridge before
 * its clock and timings are enabled by its source. For a bridge, its source
 * is generally the encoder or bridge just before it in the encoder chain.
 *
 * enable: this contains things needed to be done for the bridge once its
 * source is enabled. In other words, enable is called once the source is
 * ready with clock and timing needed by the bridge.
 *
 * disable: this contains things needed to be done for the bridge assuming
 * that its source is still enabled, i.e. clock and timings are still on.
 *
 * post_disable: this contains things needed to be done for the bridge once
 * its source is disabled, i.e. once clocks and timings are off.
 *
 * mode_fixup: this should fixup the given mode for the bridge. It is called
 * after the encoder's mode fixup. mode_fixup can also reject a mode completely
 * if it's unsuitable for the hardware.
 *
 * mode_set: this sets up the mode for the bridge. It assumes that its source
 * (an encoder or a bridge) has set the mode too.
