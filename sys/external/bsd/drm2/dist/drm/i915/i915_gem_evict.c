	 * The goal is to evict objects and amalgamate space in LRU order.
	 * The oldest idle objects reside on the inactive list, which is in
	 * retirement order. The next objects to retire are those on the (per
	 * ring) active list that do not have an outstanding flush. Once the
	 * hardware reports completion (the seqno is updated after the
	 * batchbuffer has been finished) the clean buffer objects would
	 * be retired to the inactive list. Any dirty objects would be added
	 * to the tail of the flushing list. So after processing the clean
	 * active objects we need to emit a MI_FLUSH to retire the flushing
	 * list, hence the retirement order of the flushing list is in
	 * advance of the dirty objects on the active lists.
	 *
	 * The retirement sequence is thus:
	 *   1. Inactive objects (already retired)
	 *   2. Clean active objects
	 *   3. Flushing list
	 *   4. Dirty active objects.
	 *
	 * On each list, the oldest objects lie at the HEAD with the freshest
	 * object on the TAIL.
