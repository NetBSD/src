/* QXL fencing-

   When we submit operations to the GPU we pass a release reference to the GPU
   with them, the release reference is then added to the release ring when
   the GPU is finished with that particular operation and has removed it from
   its tree.

   So we have can have multiple outstanding non linear fences per object.

   From a TTM POV we only care if the object has any outstanding releases on
   it.

   we wait until all outstanding releases are processeed.

   sync object is just a list of release ids that represent that fence on
   that buffer.

   we just add new releases onto the sync object attached to the object.

   This currently uses a radix tree to store the list of release ids.

   For some reason every so often qxl hw fails to release, things go wrong.
