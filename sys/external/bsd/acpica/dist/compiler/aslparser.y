 * Global Notes:
 *
 * October 2005: The following list terms have been optimized (from the
 * original ASL grammar in the ACPI specification) to force the immediate
 * reduction of each list item so that the parse stack use doesn't increase on
 * each list element and possibly overflow on very large lists (>4000 items).
 * This dramatically reduces use of the parse stack overall.
