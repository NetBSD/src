acpica-unix
-----------

This source release includes:


1) a cross-OS AML interpreter

This is intended to allow commercial and open source operating systems
to be enabled for ACPI. OS specific code is still needed, but the
AML interpreter should greatly improve the development speed of ACPI
support.

The AML interpreter source should be integrated into the kernel's
build process. We recommend establishing an automated method for
this, so later versions can also be incorporated easily. Please see
the documentation on the website for API and other implementation
information.


2) iasl, an ASL compiler/decompiler

iasl compiles ASL (ACPI Source Language) into AML (ACPI Machine
Language). This AML is suitable for inclusion as a DSDT in system
firmware. It also can disassemble AML, for debugging purposes.

To compile:

cd compiler
make

It has been compiled on Linux, but should easily port to other Unix
environments.

Run 'iasl -h' for more information, or download the binary version for
documentation in PDF format.


3) acpisrc, a source code conversion tool

acpisrc converts the standard form of the acpica source release (included
here) into a version that meets Linux coding guidelines. This consists
mainly of performing a series of string replacements and transformations
to the code.

To compile:

cd tools/acpisrc
make

It has been compiled on Linux, but should easily port to other Unix
environments.


4) acpibin, an AML file tool

acpibin compares AML files, dumps AML binary files to text files,
extracts binary AML from text files, and other AML file
manipulation.

To compile:

cd tools/acpibin
make


5) acpiexec, a user-space AML interpreter

acpiexec allows the loading of ACPI tables and execution of control
methods from user space.  Useful for debugging AML code and testing
the AML interpreter.

To compile:

cd tools/acpiexec
make
