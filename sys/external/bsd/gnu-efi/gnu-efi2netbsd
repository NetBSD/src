# gnu-efi2netbsd:  convert an gnu-efi source tree into a
# NetBSD gnu-efi source tree, under src/sys/external/bsd,
#
# Rough instructions for importing new gnu-efi release:
#
#	$ cd /some/where/temporary
#	$ tar xpfz /new/gnu-efi/release/tar/file
#	$ sh /usr/src/sys/external/bsd/gnu-efi/gnu-efi2netbsd gnu-efi-x.y
#	$ cd gnu-efi-x.y
#	$ cvs -d cvs.netbsd.org:/cvsroot import -m "Import gnu-efi-x.yz" src/sys/external/bsd/gnu-efi/dist GNU_EFI gnu-efi-x_y_z
#	- check makefiles to see if any extra sources have been added.
#	- update distrib/sets if necessary.
