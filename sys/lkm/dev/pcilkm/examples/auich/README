The auich module is provided as an example of the use of the pcilkm layer.

It should be noted that it has limitations.  First, it cannot be unloaded.
This is because auich(4) does not provide a detach() method, thus neither
the underlying audio(4) device nor the auich(4) device can be detached.
Therefore the pcilkm layer prevents the auich module from being removed.

Second, auich(4) has some dependencies, listed in dev/pci/files.pci, which
are required for the module to work properly.  This includes audio, ac97
and some other components that may interact with each other.

For example, the aurateconv component, needed by auich(4), is optional in
the NetBSD kernel for audio(4) operations, and does not change the API.
If aurateconv is lacking, loading the auich module will result in a
panic.  It might be considered as a bug, but it is not really relevant
since most of the kernel is not ready for device drivers modules.

To test that module, I recommend that you keep in your kernel config file
the definition for auvia* at pci?, since auvia(4) has the same list of
requirements as auich(4).
