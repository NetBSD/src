o  Change file naming pattern: Other drivers (adb, if) use a prefix. 
   We could use 

	iwm.s		(was: iwm.s)
	iwm_regs.s	(was: iwmRegs.s)
	iwm_fd.c	(was: fd.c)
	iwm_fdvar.h	(was: fdvar.h)
	iwm_reg.h	(was: iwmreg.h)

   and "swim_*" when it comes to it...
   The lkm sources would then be

	iwm_mod.c	(was: iwmModule.c)
	iwm_mod.h	(was: fdmod.h)

o  location: Is obio fine, or should the driver files be placed in dev?

o  LKM location: Is /sys/arch/mac68k/lkm appropriate or should the 
   lkm rather go to sys/lkm?

o  Do statistics in fdstart() about retries and errors.

o  send-pr because disklabel(8) displays transition times in milliseconds
   whereas <sys/disklabel.h> has them in microseconds (us).


980606

o  The Performa 630, a CLASS_Q2 machine according to mac68k/mac68k/machdep.c,
   fails to attach (initialize) the IWM. Apparently the driver tickles 
   the right spot, though: Booting with an inserted disk lets the driver
   "find" two (unsupported) HD drives. What IWM chip does that box have?
   [SWIM II] 
   Has Apple changed the IWM register layout with introducing 
   manual-insertion floppy drives? 
   [Yes; All 040 Macs need System 7 which does not fit on an 800k disk, 
   so the 800k code is legacy and need not be present at boot time.]


980602

o  send-pr because static array fscknames[] cannot be disabled in 
   <sys/disklabel.h> 
   [FIXED as of 11/98 by J. Thorpe]

o  send-pr because <bsd.kmod.mk> tries to unload a kernel module 
   under a different name than it was loaded and fails miserably.
   [bin/4701]

o  finish manpage

o  Just how much KNF can I take (CAPITALIZATION, __P() noise) ?


Old stuff

o  Consistent motor on/off management
o  Order of responsibilities for iwm_softc_t <-> fd_softc_t
o  Service SCC during floppy access
o  Implement track buffer
o  Support SWIM mode (720K/1440K MFM)
o  Check for IWM/SWIM (original 800k Mac II's)
o  Test driver with 2 drives
