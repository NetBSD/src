These are not necessarily in order of importance:

Support hardware breakpoints on processors/machines
that have them (e.g. 386)(maybe, use them only
for watchpoints, since their number is limited).

Support debugging a single process only (breakpoints only
stop when hit by the correct process).

Support additional registers (CRx, FPU etc.)

Support interrupting a debugging handshake when the
protocol hangs (Is this necessary? easily possible?).

Support handling of pagefaults so the debugger sees the
same memory contents as the kernel (Extremely questionable,
since it would need to much interaction between debugger
and the rest of the kernel, I think).

Support prespecification of debugging host in the config file
to better control access to the debuggee.

Allow different source debugging ports for debugging multiple
machines from one debugger machine.
