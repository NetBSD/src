Things to do for scheduler activations/LWP code.

Bugs:
 
- MD bug: i386 code needs to handle SSE format FP.

- MD bug: i386 npx handling. cpu_getcontext() may call npxsave(), which
  can only be run at spl0, which is a problem. Options
   * Change npxsave to avoid that requirement.
   * Don't save FP context at getcontext() time, but do something
     More Clever with lazy FPU switching.

- MD bug: tetts/thread2 panics the alpha somewhere after the first
  unblocked upcall. The kernel appears to jump into space.

- lwp-exit2: kill -9 should succeed against processes whose LWPs are
  all suspended.

- Implement better management of the lwp cache for a sa process. High-water 
  mark needed, at the very least.

- Prevent multiple PREEMPTED upcalls from being delivered before a
  process ever returns to userspace.

- Prevent race conditions between asynchronous upcall-generating
  events (realtimerexpire, maybe signals?) and sa_yield().

- Signals should not wake up sleeping normal LWPs of SA processes -
  the kernel doesn't know what the signal mask of the executing thread
  is, and can't make the decision about whether to wake them. Defer to
  userland, in true SA style.

Wishlist:

- exit1() is too fragile. A cleaner solution to the LWPWAIT_EXITCONTROL
  problem is also needed.

- Document! Not everyone wants to read the thesis. Man pages, etc.

- Rethink scheduler. Verify that behavior is still correct for a system
  of single-LWP ("traditional") processes (I believe it is, but it should 
  still be verified). Study scheduling behavior of multi-LWP and SA processes.
  Notions of fairness and appropriate scheduling may need changing.
  XXX when combined with multiprocessor support, usefully scheduling multi-lwp
  processes requires a whole new kind of scheduling. Implementing such a thing
  (such as an "equal-space" scheduler) is a major project unto itself.

- Debugging interface needs work; ptrace(2) interface can't handle multi-LWP
  or SA processes. 

- ddb needs a way to trace specific LWPs, instead of just the
  "representative" LWP of a process.

- Lazy FPU upcall notifications.
