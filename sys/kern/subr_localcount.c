 * CPU-local reference counts

 *	localcount(9) is a reference-counting scheme that involves no

 *	expensive interprocessor synchronization to drain references.
 *
 *	localcount(9) references may be held across sleeps, may be
 *	transferred from CPU to CPU or thread to thread: they behave
 *	semantically like typical reference counts, with different
