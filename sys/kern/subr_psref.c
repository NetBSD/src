/*
 * Passive references
 *
 *	Passive references are references to objects that guarantee the
 *	object will not be destroyed until the reference is released.
 *
 *	Passive references require no interprocessor synchronization to
 *	acquire or release.  However, destroying the target of passive
 *	references requires expensive interprocessor synchronization --
 *	xcalls to determine on which CPUs the object is still in use.
 *
 *	Passive references may be held only on a single CPU and by a
 *	single LWP.  They require the caller to allocate a little stack
 *	space, a struct psref object.  Sleeping while a passive
 *	reference is held is allowed, provided that the owner's LWP is
 *	bound to a CPU -- e.g., the owner is a softint or a bound
 *	kthread.  However, sleeping should be kept to a short duration,
 *	e.g. sleeping on an adaptive lock.
 *
 *	Passive references serve as an intermediate stage between
 *	reference counting and passive serialization (pserialize(9)):
 *
 *	- If you need references to transfer from CPU to CPU or LWP to
 *	  LWP, or if you need long-term references, you must use
 *	  reference counting, e.g. with atomic operations or locks,
 *	  which incurs interprocessor synchronization for every use --
 *	  cheaper than an xcall, but not scalable.
 *
 *	- If all users *guarantee* that they will not sleep, then it is
 *	  not necessary to use passive references: you may as well just
 *	  use the even cheaper pserialize(9), because you have
 *	  satisfied the requirements of a pserialize read section.
