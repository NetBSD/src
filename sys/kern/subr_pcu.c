/*
 * Per CPU Unit (PCU) - is an interface to manage synchronization of any
 * per CPU context (unit) tied with LWP context.  Typical use: FPU state.
 *
 * Concurrency notes:
 *
 *	PCU state may be loaded only by the current LWP, that is, curlwp.
 *	Therefore, only LWP itself can set a CPU for lwp_t::l_pcu_cpu[id].
 *
 *	Request for a PCU release can be from owner LWP (whether PCU state
 *	is on current CPU or remote CPU) or any other LWP running on that
 *	CPU (in such case, owner LWP is on a remote CPU or sleeping).
 *
 *	In any case, PCU state can only be changed from the running CPU.
 *	If said PCU state is on the remote CPU, a cross-call will be sent
 *	by the owner LWP.  Therefore struct cpu_info::ci_pcu_curlwp[id]
 *	may only be changed by current CPU, and lwp_t::l_pcu_cpu[id] may
 *	only be unset by the CPU which has PCU state loaded.
 *
 *	There is a race condition: LWP may have a PCU state on a remote CPU,
 *	which it requests to be released via cross-call.  At the same time,
 *	other LWP on remote CPU might release existing PCU state and load
 *	its own one.  Cross-call may arrive after this and release different
 *	PCU state than intended.  In such case, such LWP would re-load its
 *	PCU state again.
