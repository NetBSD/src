 * int of_network_decode_media(phandle, nmediap, defmediap)

 *
 * Arguments:
 *	phandle		OFW phandle of device whos network media properties

 *	defmediap	Pointer to an integer which will be initialized

 * Return Values:
 *	An array of integers, allocated with malloc(), containing the

 *	be stored in the location pointed to by the `nmediap' argument.
 *	The default media will be stored in the location pointed to by
