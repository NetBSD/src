Some things that need to be done:
---------------------------------

High priority:
--------------

Fix flow control in ucom (copy from com driver).

Use some encapsulation in the upl driver to allow multiple protocols.

Get the uezcom driver (with Doug Ambrisko's firmware) running.


General:
--------

Figure out why uvisor is so slow.
Try to get specs, and check if Linux driver is really right.

Do bandwidth accounting.

Throw out more USBDI gunk.

Make hub driver notice transition between self and bus powered state.
Some hubs change the number of available ports on this transition. :(
Handle overcurrent conditions.

Make it possible to open any device in a "generic" way, i.e., like ugen.
Perhaps usbdevfs?

Rotate the QHs for bulk transport to get fairer scheduling.

Change HC drivers to queue multiple request for an endpoint
to get better performance.

uaudio problems:
	mixer names are awful, use some heuristics.
	implement selector units
	debug input

Stylistic changes:
	use usb_ and usbd_ consistently
	rearrange the contents and names of some files (Nick)

Use usbnet in if_umb(4).  Figure out how to use it for wifi.

Keyspan serial driver

Clean up umass driver


Documentation:
--------------

Complete documentation of device driver API.

Complete documentation of HC driver API.

Update ugen(4)
