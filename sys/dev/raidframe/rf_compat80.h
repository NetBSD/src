/*
 * These ioctls were versioned after NetBSD 8.x.
 *
 * RAIDFRAME_FAIL_DISK had unused pointers removed from the structure.
 * RAIDFRAME_CHECK_*EXT and RAIDFRAME_GET_COMPONENT_LABEL were converted
 * from pointers to full structures so that ioctl framework does the copyout.
 * RAIDFRAME_GET_INFO80 had the containing structure reorganised so that
 * the layout became bitsize neutral.
 *
 * These 6 changes enable COMPAT_NETBSD32 support to work sanely with
 * these ioctls, leaving only RAIDFRAME_CONFIGURE needing extra help.
