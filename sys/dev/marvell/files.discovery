# Config file and device description for machine-independent support for
# the Moverll (formerly Galileo Technologies) Discovery system controllers.
#
# Ports that include this must also supply some glue code of their own.
# Notably:
#	* devices here are indirectly configured by the configuration
# 	  file since difference systems will be configured somewhat
#	  differently,
#	* The Multi-Purpose Port (MPP) is configured differently on
#	  different systems,
#	* CPU attachment is handled in largely a machine-independent
#	  fashion,
#	* The interrupts on different systems will be handled differently.
#
# Systems with multiple GT controllers are not currently handled by this
# code.
