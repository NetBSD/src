Bugs
----

mvsata, siisata - fix all 'XXX slot' 

test wd* at umass?, confirm the ata_channel kludge works

is ata_exec_xfer() + POLL safe wrt. more outstanding I/Os? why is it waiting
until xfer is head of queue? also layer violation with the ata_xfer_free() call

NCQ PRIO/ICC handling
---------------------
fix handling of ATA 'devices' value to be full 16-bit value, to prepare for
the ICC/AUXILIARY support

set PRIO/ICC for NCQ transfers for BPRIO_TIMECRITICAL/BPRIO_TIMELIMITED
NCQ ICC - investigate and set/get the behaviour with timeouts (WDNC, RDNC)

Other random notes (maybe do outside the NCQ branch):
-----------------------------------------------------
add support for the NCQ TRIM if supported by device?

protect more of wddone() with mutex?

refactor mvsata to reuse (more of) ata_wdc.c? duplicates e.g. mode selection
logic

implement DIOCGCACHE/DIOCCACHESYNC for ld@ataraid? just passthrough, like ccd

MSI/MSI-X support for AHCI

malloc(M_CANFAIL) actually doesn't do anything
