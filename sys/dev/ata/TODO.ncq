test crashdump with ahci

siisata - fix all 'XXX slot' 

test wd* at umass?, confirm the ata_channel kludge works

is ata_exec_xfer() + POLL safe wrt. more outstanding I/Os? why is it waiting
until xfer is head of queue? also layer violation with the ata_xfer_free() call

Other random notes (do outside the NCQ branch):
-----------------------------------------------------
add nibble to control number of tags (1==disable NCQ)?

add support for the NCQ TRIM if supported by device?

protect more of wddone() with mutex?

implement DIOCGCACHE/DIOCCACHESYNC for ld@ataraid? just passthrough, like ccd

MSI/MSI-X support for AHCI and mvsata(4)

mvsata - constify mvsata_pci_products and move pci-specific code to
the pci attach code

mvsata(4) 64-bit DMA
- at least with AHA1430SA does not really work, crash in mvsata_intr() on boot

malloc(M_CANFAIL) actually doesn't do anything
