test crashdump with ahci

siisata - fix all new XXX and unmergable bits

test crashdump with siisata

test wd* at umass?, confirm the ata_channel kludge works

is ata_exec_xfer() + POLL safe wrt. more outstanding I/Os? why is it waiting
until xfer is head of queue? also layer violation with the ata_xfer_free() call

further test port multipliers (currently appears to not work)

test device error handling (currently appears to not work well, at least in NCQ case)

do proper NCQ error recovery (currently not even really attempted)

maybe do device error handling in not-interrupt-context (maybe this should be
done on a mpata branch?)

atabus(4) queue depth can only shrink, causing NCQ to not be available if NCQ
drive rescaned after detach of non-NCQ drive

Other random notes (do outside the NCQ branch):
-----------------------------------------------------
add nibble to control number of tags (1==disable NCQ)?

add support for the NCQ TRIM if supported by device?

protect more of wddone() with mutex?

implement DIOCGCACHE/DIOCCACHESYNC for ld@ataraid? just passthrough, like ccd

MSI/MSI-X support for AHCI and mvsata(4)

mvsata - constify mvsata_pci_products and move pci-specific code to
the pci attach code

mvsata(4) 64-bit DMA
- at least with AHA1430SA does not really work, crash in mvsata_intr() on boot

malloc(M_CANFAIL) actually doesn't do anything
