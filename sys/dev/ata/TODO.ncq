test wd* at umass?, confirm the ata_channel kludge works

Other random notes (do outside the NCQ branch):
-----------------------------------------------------
do biodone() in wddone() starting the dump to not leak bufs when dumping from
active system? make sure to not trigger atastart()
- call ata_kill_active() + ata_kill_pending() when dumping

implement support for PM FIS-based switching, remove restriction in atastart()
for hw which supports it, adjust error handling in controller drivers to handle
xfers for several different drives

maybe do device error handling in not-interrupt-context (maybe this should be
done on a mpata branch?)

queue is allocated regardless if there are any drives, fix? 

dump to unopened disk fails (e.g. dump do wd1b when wd1a not mounted), due
to the open path executing ata_get_params(), which eventually tsleeps()
while waiting for the command to finish; specifically, if WDF_LOADED is not
set 
- happens due to wd_get_params() with just AT_WAIT in wdopen()
- not easy to fix, open needs to read disklabel and all this mechanics
  is too much for emergency crash dump code path
- old bug - kern/16789

add support for the NCQ TRIM if supported by device?

implement DIOCGCACHE/DIOCCACHESYNC for ld@ataraid? just passthrough, like ccd

MSI/MSI-X support for AHCI and mvsata(4)

mvsata - constify mvsata_pci_products and move pci-specific code to
the pci attach code

mvsata(4) 64-bit DMA
- at least with AHA1430SA does not really work, crash in mvsata_intr() on boot

malloc(M_CANFAIL) actually doesn't do anything
