ahci with NCQ gets frequent timeouts, something's amiss

under QEMU, the mounted AHCI drive doesn't show directories for ls,
but cd, mkdir, stat and creating files wroks just fine - what do?

ata_xfer_*() uses wd->drvp->chnl_softc as ata_channel, but it's umass
softc for wd? at umass*

protect more of wddone() with mutex?

refactor mvsata to reuse (more of) ata_wdc.c?

NCQ ICC - investigate and set/get the behaviour with timeouts

implement DIOCGCACHE/DIOCCACHESYNC for ld@ataraid? just passthrough, like ccd

MSI/MSI-X support for AHCI

fix all 'XXX slot' 

malloc(M_CANFAIL) actually doesn't do anything
