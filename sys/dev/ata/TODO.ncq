Bugs
----

under QEMU, the mounted AHCI drive doesn't show directories for ls,
but cd, mkdir, stat and creating files wroks just fine - what do?
- https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-current/2011-September/027294.html
- somewhat critical since we use QEMU for babylon builds

ahci driver - fix error handling to iterate over all relevant xfers

mvsata, siisata - fix all 'XXX slot' 

test wd* at umass?, confirm the ata_channel kludge works

NCQ PRIO/ICC handling
---------------------
fix handling of ATA 'devices' value to be full 16-bit value, to prepare for
the ICC/AUXILIARY support

set PRIO/ICC for NCQ transfers for BPRIO_TIMECRITICAL/BPRIO_TIMELIMITED
NCQ ICC - investigate and set/get the behaviour with timeouts (WDNC, RDNC)

Other random notes (maybe do outside the NCQ branch):
-----------------------------------------------------
add support for the NCQ TRIM if supported by device?

protect more of wddone() with mutex?

refactor mvsata to reuse (more of) ata_wdc.c? duplicates e.g. mode selection
logic

implement DIOCGCACHE/DIOCCACHESYNC for ld@ataraid? just passthrough, like ccd

MSI/MSI-X support for AHCI

malloc(M_CANFAIL) actually doesn't do anything
