Bugs
----

fix crashdump for mvsata - request times out (maybe same as HEAD?)

siisata - fix all new XXX and unmergable bits, fix PMP

test crashdump with siisata
- fails with recursive panic via pmap_kremove_local() regardless if
  drive connected via PMP or direct

test wd* at umass?, confirm the ata_channel kludge works
+ add detach code (channel detach, free queue)

test device error handling (currently appears to not work well, at least in NCQ case)

do proper NCQ error recovery (currently not even really attempted)

maybe do device error handling in not-interrupt-context (maybe this should be
done on a mpata branch?)

add mechanics to re-check queue when xfer is finished - needed on PMP
and for IDE disks, when one drive uses up all available xfers nothing
ever restarts queue for the other drives

Other random notes (do outside the NCQ branch):
-----------------------------------------------------
change wd(4) to use dk_open()

dump to unopened disk fails (e.g. dump do wd1b when wd1a not mounted), due
to the open path executing ata_get_params(), which eventually tsleeps()
while waiting for the command to finish; specifically, if WDF_LOADED is not
set 
- happens due to wd_get_params() with just AT_WAIT in wdopen()
- not easy to fix, open needs to read disklabel and all this mechanics
  is too much for emergency crash dump code path
- old bug - kern/16789

add nibble to control number of tags (1==disable NCQ)?

add support for the NCQ TRIM if supported by device?

protect more of wddone() with mutex?

implement DIOCGCACHE/DIOCCACHESYNC for ld@ataraid? just passthrough, like ccd

MSI/MSI-X support for AHCI and mvsata(4)

mvsata - constify mvsata_pci_products and move pci-specific code to
the pci attach code

mvsata(4) 64-bit DMA
- at least with AHA1430SA does not really work, crash in mvsata_intr() on boot

malloc(M_CANFAIL) actually doesn't do anything
