ahci with NCQ gets frequent timeouts, something's amiss; improve message
to use dev for the drive, not the controller

under QEMU, the mounted AHCI drive doesn't show directories for ls,
but cd, mkdir, stat and creating files wroks just fine - what do?

test wd* at umass?, confirm the ata_channel kludge works

set PRIO/ICC for NCQ transfers for BPRIO_TIMECRITICAL/BPRIO_TIMELIMITED

protect more of wddone() with mutex?

refactor mvsata to reuse (more of) ata_wdc.c?

NCQ ICC - investigate and set/get the behaviour with timeouts

implement DIOCGCACHE/DIOCCACHESYNC for ld@ataraid? just passthrough, like ccd

MSI/MSI-X support for AHCI

fix all 'XXX slot' 

malloc(M_CANFAIL) actually doesn't do anything
