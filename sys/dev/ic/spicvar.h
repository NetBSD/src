 * The SPIC is used on some Sony Vaios to handle the jog dial and other
 * peripherals.
 * The protocol used by the SPIC seems to vary wildly among the different
 * models, and I've found no documentation.
 * This file handles the jog dial on the SRX77 model, and perhaps nothing
 * else.
 *
 * The general way of talking to the SPIC was gleaned from the Linux and
 * FreeBSD drivers.  The hex numbers were taken from these drivers (they
 * come from reverese engineering.)
 *
 * TODO:
 *   Make it handle more models.
 *   Figure out why the interrupt mode doesn't work.
