- use the dirty flag introduced by Win95 OSR2, as noted in bin/5638
- the fat cache (see msdosfs_fat.c, denode->de_fc[]) should probably
	hold all cluster numbers for directories to speed up file lookup;
	doing the same for files is likely to not be worth the needed
	memory, since they are often much bigger and scanned much less
	frequently
