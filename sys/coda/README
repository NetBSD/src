Coda is a distributed filesystem.  It is derived from AFS, but
supports disconnected operation, both reading and writing.  This
directory contains the interface between the VFS layer and a
user-space program ("venus") that implements the client part of Coda.
The interface is similar to puffs(9) in many respects.

Coda servers do not need kernel support.

For information on Coda, see
  http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu

As of Sat Aug  4 15:45:27 EEST 2012
	- The coda/vcoda modules have been tested for read/write
	  operations and load/unload on amd64 with a DEBUG/DIAGNOSTIC
	  kernel and there are no locking errors.
	- If you find issues with coda, please file a bug report.
	  Also help can be obtained via the list codalist@coda.cs.cmu.edu.
	- Pkgsrc/net/coda has the latest source available from cmu and
	  has been fixed to co-exist with openafs (openafs has been modified)

To test:
- Install pkgsrc/net/coda

# rm -fr /var/lib/coda			# remove junk if there was a crash
# /usr/pkg/sbin/venus-setup xxxx	# xxxx the domain name
# /usr/pkg/sbin/venus
# clog guest@testserver.coda.cs.cmu.edu	# password is guest
# echo foo > /coda/testserver.coda.cs.cmu.edu/playground/nb.test0 

You should be able to access things in /coda
