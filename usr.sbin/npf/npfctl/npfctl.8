.Sh NAME
.Nm npfctl
.Nd control NPF packet filter
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm npfctl
.Ar command
.Op Ar arguments
.\" -----
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command can be used to control the NPF packet filter.
For a description of NPF's configuration file, see
.Xr npf.conf 5 .
.Pp
The first argument,
.Ar command ,
specifies the action to take.
Valid commands are:
.Bl -tag -width reload -offset 3n
.It Ic start
Enable packet inspection using the currently loaded configuration, if any.
Note that this command does not load or reload the configuration,
or affect existing sessions.
.It Ic stop
Disable packet inspection.
This command does not change the currently loaded configuration,
or affect existing sessions.
.It Ic reload Op Ar path
Load or reload configuration from file.
The configuration file at
.Pa /etc/npf.conf
will be used unless a file is specified by
.Ar path .
All sessions will be preserved during the reload, except those which
will lose NAT policy due to removal.
NAT policy is determined by the translation type and address.
Note that change of filter criteria will not expire associated sessions.
The reload operation (i.e., replacing the ruleset, NAT policies and tables)
is atomic.
.It Ic flush
Flush configuration.
That is, remove all rules, tables and expire all sessions.
This command does not disable packet inspection.
.It Ic show
Show the current state and configuration.
Syntax of printed configuration is for the user and may not match the
.Xr npf.conf 5
syntax.
.\".It Ic table Ar tid
.\"List all entries in the currently loaded table specified by
.\".Ar tid .
.It Ic table Ar tid Ic [ add | rem ] Aq Ar addr/mask
In table
.Ar tid ,
add or remove the IP address and optionally netmask, specified by
.Aq Ar addr/mask .
Only tree-type tables support masks.
.It Ic table Ar tid Ic test Aq Ar addr
Query the table
.Ar tid
for a specific IP address, specified by
.Ar addr .
If no mask is specified, a single host is assumed.
.It Ic sess-save
Save all active sessions.
The data will be stored in the
.Pa /var/db/npf_sessions.db
file.
Administrator may want to stop the packet inspection before the
session saving.
.It Ic sess-load
Load saved sessions from the file.
Note that original configuration should be loaded before the session loading.
In a case of NAT policy changes, sessions which lose an associated policy
will not be loaded.
Any existing sessions during the load operation will be expired.
Administrator may want to start packet inspection after the session loading.
.It Ic stats
Print various statistics.
.El
.Sh PERFORMANCE
Reloading the configuration is a relatively expensive operation.
Therefore, frequent reloads should be avoided.
Use of tables should be considered as an alternative design.
See
.Xr npf.conf 5
for details.
