.Sh NAME
.Nm npfctl
.Nd control NPF packet filter
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm npfctl
.Ar command
.Op Ar arguments
.\" -----
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command can be used to control the NPF packet filter.
For a description of NPF's configuration file, see
.Xr npf.conf 5 .
.Pp
The first argument,
.Ar command ,
specifies the action to take.
Valid commands are:
.Bl -tag -width reload -offset 3n
.It Ic start
Enable packet inspection using the currently loaded configuration, if any.
Note that this command does not load or reload the configuration,
or affect existing sessions.
.It Ic stop
Disable packet inspection.
This command does not change the currently loaded configuration,
or affect existing sessions.
.It Ic reload Op Ar path
Load or reload configuration from file.
The configuration file at
.Pa /etc/npf.conf
will be used unless a file is specified by
.Ar path .
All sessions will be preserved during the reload, except those which
will lose NAT policy due to removal.
NAT policy is determined by the translation type and address.
Note that change of filter criteria will not expire associated sessions.
The reload operation (i.e., replacing the ruleset, NAT policies and tables)
is atomic.
.It Ic flush
Flush configuration.
That is, remove all rules, tables and expire all sessions.
This command does not disable packet inspection.
.It Ic show
Show the current state and configuration.
Syntax of printed configuration is for the user and may not match the
.Xr npf.conf 5
syntax.
.It Ic validate Op Ar path
Validate the configuration file and the processed form.
The configuration file at
.Pa /etc/npf.conf
will be used unless a file is specified by
.Ar path .
.\" ---
.It Ic rule Ar name Ic add Aq rule-syntax
Add a rule to a dynamic ruleset specified by
.Ar name .
On success, returns a unique identifier which can be used to remove
the rule with
.Ic rem-id
command.
.It Ic rule Ar name Ic rem Aq rule-syntax
Remove a rule from a dynamic ruleset specified by
.Ar name .
This method uses SHA1 hash computed on a rule to identify it.
Although very unlikely, it is subject to hash collisions.
For a fully reliable and more efficient method, it is recommended to use 
.Ic rem-id
command.
.It Ic rule Ar name Ic rem-id Aq id
Remove a rule specified by unique
.Ar id
from a dynamic ruleset specified by
.Ar name .
.\" ---
.It Ic table Ar tid Ic add Aq Ar addr/mask
In table
.Ar tid ,
add the IP address and optionally netmask, specified by
.Aq Ar addr/mask .
Only tree-type tables support masks.
.It Ic table Ar tid Ic rem Aq Ar addr/mask
In table
.Ar tid ,
remove the IP address and optionally netmask, specified by
.Aq Ar addr/mask .
Only tree-type tables support masks.
.It Ic table Ar tid Ic test Aq Ar addr
Query the table
.Ar tid
for a specific IP address, specified by
.Ar addr .
If no mask is specified, a single host is assumed.
.It Ic table Ar tid Ic list
List all entries in the currently loaded table specified by
.Ar tid .
This operation is expensive and should be used with caution.
.\" ---
.It Ic sess-save
Save all active sessions.
The data will be stored in the
.Pa /var/db/npf_sessions.db
file.
Administrator may want to stop the packet inspection before the
session saving.
.It Ic sess-load
Load saved sessions from the file.
Note that original configuration should be loaded before the session loading.
In a case of NAT policy changes, sessions which lose an associated policy
will not be loaded.
Any existing sessions during the load operation will be expired.
Administrator may want to start packet inspection after the session loading.
.It Ic stats
Print various statistics.
.It Ic debug
Process the configuration file, print the n-code of each rule
and dump the raw configuration.
This is primarily for developer use.
.El
.Sh PERFORMANCE
Reloading the configuration is a relatively expensive operation.
Therefore, frequent reloads should be avoided.
Use of tables should be considered as an alternative design.
See
.Xr npf.conf 5
for details.

Addition and removal of entries in the table whose ID is 2:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# npfctl table 2 add 10.0.0.1
# npfctl table 2 rem 182.168.0.0/24
