.Sh NAME
.Nm npfctl
.Nd control NPF packet filter
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm npfctl
.Ar command
.Op Ar arguments
.\" -----
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command can be used to control the NPF packet filter.
For a description of NPF's configuration file, see
.Xr npf.conf 8 .
.Pp
The first argument,
.Ar command ,
specifies the action to take.
Valid commands are:
.Bl -tag -width reload
.It start
Enable packet inspection using the currently loaded configuration, if any.
Note that this command does not load or reload the configuration.
.It stop
Disable packet inspection.
This command does not change the currently loaded configuration.
.It reload Op Ar path
Load or reload configuration from file.
The configuration file at
.Pa /etc/npf.conf
will be used unless a file is specified by
.Ar path .
The reload operation (i.e., replacing the ruleset) is atomic.
.It flush
Flush configuration.
That is, remove all rules and tables.
This command does not disable packet inspection.
.It table Ar tid
List all entries in the currently loaded table specified by
.Ar tid .
Fail if
.Ar tid
does not exist.
.It table Ar tid Aq Ar addr/mask
Query the table
.Ar tid
for a specific IPv4 CIDR, specified by
.Ar addr/mask .
If no mask is specified, a single host is assumed.
.It table Ar tid Ar [ add | rem ] Aq Ar addr/mask
In table
.Ar tid ,
add or remove the IPv4 CIDR specified by
.Aq Ar addr/mask .
.El
.\" -----
.Sh PERFORMANCE
Reloading the configuration is a relatively expensive operation.
Therefore, frequent reloads should be avoided.
Use of tables should be considered as an alternative design.
See
.Xr npf.conf 8
for details.
