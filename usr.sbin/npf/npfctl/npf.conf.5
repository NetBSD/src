.Sh NAME
.Nm npf.conf
.Nd NPF packet filter configuration file
.\" -----
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the default configuration file for NPF packet filter.
It can contain definitions, grouped rules, rule procedures, and tables.
.Ss Definitions
Definitions are general purpose keywords which can be used in the
ruleset to make it more flexible and easier to manage.
Most commonly, definitions are used to define one of the following:
IP addresses, networks, ports, or interfaces.
Definitions can contain multiple elements.
.Ss Groups
Having one huge ruleset for all interfaces or directions might be
inefficient; therefore, NPF requires that all rules be defined within groups.
Groups can be thought of as higher level rules which have subrules.
The main properties of a group are its interface and traffic direction.
Packets matching group criteria are passed to the ruleset of that group.
If a packet does not match any group, it is passed to the default group.
The default group must always be defined.
.Ss Rules
Rules, which are the main part of NPF configuration, describe the criteria
used to inspect and make decisions about packets.
Currently, NPF supports filtering on the following criteria: interface,
traffic direction, protocol, IPv4 address or network, TCP/UDP port
or range, TCP flags, and ICMP type/code.
Supported actions are blocking or passing the packet.
.Pp
Each rule has a priority, which is set according to its order in the ruleset.
Rules defined first are accordingly inspected first.
All rules in the group are inspected sequentially, and the last matching
dictates the action to be taken.
Rules, however, may be explicitly marked as final (that is, "quick").
In such cases, processing stops after encountering the first matching rule
marked as final.
If there is no matching rule in the custom group, then rules in the default
group will be inspected.
.Pp
Stateful filtering is supported using the "keep state" keyword.
In such cases, state (a session) is created and any further packets
of the connection are tracked.
Packets in backwards stream, after having been confirmed to belong to
the same connection, are passed without ruleset inspection.
Rules may have associated rule procedures (described in a later section),
which are applied for all packets of a connection.
.Pp
Definitions (prefixed with "$") and tables (specified by an ID within
"\*[Lt]\*[Gt]" marks) can be used in the filter options of rules.
.Ss Rule procedures and normalisation
Rule procedures are provided to perform packet transformations and various
additional procedures on the packets.
It should be noted that rule procedures are applied for the connections,
that is, both for packets which match the rule and for further packets
of the connection, which are passed without ruleset inspection.
Currently, two facilities are supported:
traffic normalisation and packet logging.
Packet normalisation has the following functionality:
IP ID randomisation, IP_DF flag cleansing, TCP minimum TTL enforcement,
and maximum MSS enforcement ("MSS clamping").
If a matching rule is going to drop the packet, normalisation functions
are not performed.
Packet logging is performed both in packet passing and blocking cases.
Note that the logging interface has to be created manually, using
.Xr ifconfig 8
routine, for example:
.Pp
ifconfig npflog0 create
.Pp
.Ss Network address translation
Rules for address translation can be added.
Translation is performed on the specified interface, assigning the specified
address of said interface.
There are three types of translation:
Network Address Port Translation (NAPT) - a regular NAT,
also known as "outbound NAT";
Port forwarding (redirection) - also known as "inbound NAT";
Bi-directional NAT - a combination of inbound and outbound NAT.
.Pp
Minimal filtering criteria on local network and destination are provided.
Note that address translation implies routing, therefore IP forwarding
is required to be enabled:
net.inet.ip.forwarding = 1.
See
.Xr sysctl 7
for more details.
.Ss Tables
Certain configurations might use very large sets of IP addresses or change
sets frequently.
Storing large IP sets in the configuration file or performing frequent
reloads can have a significant performance cost.
.Pp
In order to achieve high performance, NPF has tables.
NPF tables provide separate storage designed for large IP sets and frequent
updates without reloading the entire ruleset.
Tables can be managed dynamically or loaded from a separate file, which
is useful for large static tables.
There are two types of storage: "tree" (red-black tree is used) and
"hash".
