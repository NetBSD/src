.Sh NAME
.Nm npf.conf
.Nd NPF packet filter configuration file
.\" -----
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the default configuration file for the NPF packet filter.
.Pp
This manual page serves as a reference for editing
.Nm .
Please refer to the official NPF documentation website for comprehensive and
in-depth information.
.Pp
There are multiple structural elements that
.Nm
may contain, such as:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
variables
.It
table definitions (with or without content)
.It
abstraction groups
.It
packet filtering rules
.It
map rules for address translation
.It
application level gateways
.It
procedure definitions to call on filtered packets.
.El
.Sh SYNTAX
.Ss Variables
Variables are specified using the dollar ($) sign, which is used for both
definition and referencing of a variable.
Variables are defined by assigning a value to them as follows:
.Bd -literal
$var1 = 10.0.0.1
.Ed
.Pp
A variable may also be defined as a set:
.Bd -literal
$var2 = { 10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2 }
.Ed
.Pp
Common variable definitions are for IP addresses, networks, ports,
and interfaces.
.Ss Tables
Tables are specified using a name between angle brackets
< and >.
The following is an example of table definition:
.Bd -literal
table <black> type hash dynamic
.Pp
.Ed
Currently, tables support three data storage types: "hash", "tree", or "cdb".
Tables can also be set as containing "dynamic" or "static" data i.e. loaded
from a specified file.
Tables of type "hash" and "cdb" can only contain IP addresses.
Only static data can be used with a storage type of "cdb".
.Pp
The specified file should contain a list of IP addresses and/or networks in the
form of:
.Bd -literal
10.0.0.0/24
10.1.1.1
.Ed
.Ss Interfaces
In NPF, an interface can be referenced directly by using its name, or can be
passed to an extraction function which will return a list of IP addresses
configured on the actual associated interface.
.Pp
It is legal to pass an extracted list from an interface in keywords where
NPF would expect instead a direct reference to said interface.
In this case, NPF infers a direct reference to the interface, and does not
consider the list.
.Pp
There are two types of IP address lists.
With a static list, NPF will capture the interface addresses on configuration
load, whereas with a dynamic list NPF will capture the runtime list of
addresses, reflecting any changes to the interface, including the attach and
detach.
Note that with a dynamic list, marking the interface as ``down'' has no effect,
all addresses will remain present.
.Pp
Three functions exist, to extract addresses from an interface with a chosen
list type and IP address type:
.Bl -tag -width Xifaddrs()XX -offset indent
.It Fn inet4
Static list, IPv4 addresses.
.It Fn inet6
Static list, IPv6 addresses.
.It Fn ifaddrs
Dynamic list, both IPv4 and IPv6.
The
.Cd family
keyword can be used in combination of a filtering rule to explicitly select
an IP address type.
.El
.Pp
Example of configuration:
.Bd -literal
$var1 = inet4(wm0)
$var2 = ifaddrs(wm0)
group default {
	block in on wm0 all               # rule 1
	block in on $var1 all             # rule 2
	block in on inet4(wm0) all        # rule 3
	pass in on inet6(wm0) from $var2  # rule 4
	pass in on wm0 from ifaddrs(wm0)  # rule 5
}
.Ed
.Pp
In the above example, $var1 is the static list of IPv4 addresses configured
on wm0, and $var2 is the dynamic list of all the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
configured on wm0.
The first three rules are equivalent, because with the
.Cd block ... on <interface>
syntax, NPF expects a direct reference to an interface, and therefore does
not consider the extraction functions.
The fourth and fifth rules are equivalent, for the same reason.
.Ss Groups
NPF requires that all rules be defined within groups.
Groups can be thought of as higher level rules which can contain subrules.
Groups may have the following options: name, interface, and direction.
Packets matching group criteria are passed to the ruleset of that group.
If a packet does not match any group, it is passed to the
.Cd default group .
The
.Cd default group
must always be defined.
.Pp
Example of configuration:
.Bd -literal
group "my-name" in on wm0 {
	# List of rules, for packets received on wm0
}
group default {
	# List of rules, for the other packets
}
.Ed
.Ss Rules
With a rule statement NPF is instructed to
.Cd pass
or
.Cd block
a packet depending on packet header information, transit direction and
the interface it arrived on, either immediately upon match or using the
last match.
.Pp
If a packet matches a rule which has the
.Cd final
option set, this rule is considered the last matching rule, and
evaluation of subsequent rules is skipped.
Otherwise, the last matching rule is used.
.Pp
The
.Cd proto
keyword can be used to filter packets by layer 4 protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP
or other).
Its parameter should be a protocol number or its symbolic name,
as specified in the
.Pa /etc/protocols
file.
This keyword can additionally have protocol-specific options, such as
.Cd flags .
.Pp
The
.Cd flags
keyword can be used to match the packets against specific TCP flags,
according to the following syntax:
.Bl -tag -width protoXX -offset indent
.It proto tcp flags Ar match[/mask]
.El
.Pp
Where
.Ar match
is the set of TCP flags to be matched, out of the
.Ar mask
set, both sets being represented as a string combination of: S (SYN),
A (ACK), F (FIN), R (RST). The flags that are not present in
.Ar mask
are ignored.
.Pp
To notify the sender of a blocking decision, three
.Cd return
options can be used in conjunction with a
.Cd block
rule:
.Bl -tag -width Xreturn-icmpXX -offset indent
.It return
Behaves as return-rst or return-icmp, depending on whether the packet
being blocked is TCP or UDP.
.It return-rst
Return a TCP RST message, when the packet being blocked is a TCP packet.
Applies to IPv4 and IPv6.
.It return-icmp
Return an ICMP UNREACHABLE message, when the packet being blocked is a UDP packet.
Applies to IPv4 and IPv6.
.El
.Pp
Further packet specification at present is limited to TCP and UDP
understanding source and destination ports, and ICMP and IPv6-ICMP
understanding icmp-type.
.Pp
A rule can also instruct NPF to create an entry in the state table when
passing the packet or to apply a procedure to the packet (e.g. "log").
.Pp
A "fully-featured" rule would for example be:
.Bd -literal
pass stateful in final family inet4 proto tcp flags S/SA \\
	from $source port $sport to $dest port $dport apply "someproc"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, NPF supports
.Xr pcap-filter 7
syntax, for example:
.Bd -literal
block out final pcap-filter "tcp and dst 10.1.1.252"
.Ed
.Pp
Fragments are not selectable since NPF always reassembles packets
before further processing.
.Ss Stateful
Stateful packet inspection is enabled using the
.Cd stateful
or
.Cd stateful-ends
keywords.
The former creates a state which is uniquely identified by a 5-tuple (source
and destination IP addresses, port numbers and an interface identifier).
The latter excludes the interface identifier and must be used with
precaution.
In both cases, a full TCP state tracking is performed for TCP connections
and a limited tracking for message-based protocols (UDP and ICMP).
.Pp
By default, a stateful rule implies SYN-only flag check ("flags S/SAFR")
for the TCP packets.
It is not advisable to change this behavior; however,
it can be overridden with the aforementioned
.Cd flags
keyword.
.Ss Map
Network Address Translation (NAT) is expressed in a form of segment mapping.
The translation may be
.Cd dynamic
(stateful) or
.Cd static
(stateless).
The following mapping types are available:
.Bl -tag -width <-> -offset indent
.It Pa ->
outbound NAT (translation of the source)
.It Pa <-
inbound NAT (translation of the destination)
.It Pa <->
bi-directional NAT (combination of inbound and outbound NAT)
.El
.Pp
The following would translate the source (10.1.1.0/24) to the IP address
specified by $pub_ip for the packets on the interface $ext_if.
.Bd -literal
map $ext_if dynamic 10.1.1.0/24 -> $pub_ip
.Ed
.Pp
Translations are implicitly filtered by limiting the operation to the
network segments specified, that is, translation would be performed only
on packets originating from the 10.1.1.0/24 network.
Explicit filter criteria can be specified using "pass <criteria>" as
an additional option of the mapping.
.Pp
The
.Cd dynamic
NAT implies network address and port translation (NAPT).
The port translation can be controlled explicitly.
For example, the following provides "port forwarding", redirecting the
public port 9022 to the port 22 of an internal host:
.Bd -literal
map $ext_if dynamic proto tcp 10.1.1.2 port 22 <- $ext_if port 9022
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Cd static
NAT can have different address translation algorithms, which
can be chosen using the
.Cd algo
keyword.
The currently available algorithms are:
.Bl -tag -width Xnpt66XX -offset indent
.It npt66
IPv6-to-IPv6 network prefix translation (NPTv6).
.El
.Pp
Currently, the static NAT algorithms do not perform port translation.
.Ss Application Level Gateways
Certain application layer protocols are not compatible with NAT and require
translation outside layers 3 and 4.
Such translation is performed by packet filter extensions called
Application Level Gateways (ALGs).
.Pp
NPF supports the following ALGs:
.Bl -tag -width XicmpXX -offset indent
.It icmp
ICMP ALG.
Applies to IPv4 and IPv6.
Allows to find an active connection by looking at the ICMP payload, and to
perform NAT translation of the ICMP payload.
Generally, this ALG is necessary to support "traceroute" behind the NAT,
when using the UDP or TCP probes.
.El
.Pp
The ALGs are built-in.
If NPF is used as kernel module, then they come as kernel modules too.
In such case, the ALG kernel modules can be autoloaded through the
configuration, using the
.Cd alg
keyword.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal
alg "icmp"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, the ALG kernel modules can be loaded manually, using
.Xr modload 8 .
.Ss Procedures
A rule procedure is defined as a collection of extension calls (it
may have none).
Every extension call has a name and a list of options in the form of
key-value pairs.
Depending on the call, the key might represent the argument and the value
might be optional.
Available options:
.Bl -tag -width Xlog:XinterfaceXX -offset indent
.It log: Ar interface
Log events.
This requires the npf_ext_log kernel module, which would normally get
auto-loaded by NPF.
The specified npflog interface would also be auto-created once the
configuration is loaded.
The log packets can be written to a file using the
.Xr npfd 8
daemon.
.It normalize: Xo
.Ar option1
.Op , Ar option2
.Ar ...
.Xc
Modify packets according to the specified normalization options.
This requires the npf_ext_normalize kernel module, which would normally get
auto-loaded by NPF.
.El
.Pp
The available normalization options are:
.Bl -tag -width XXmin-ttlXXvalueXX -offset indent
.It Dq random-id
Randomize the IPv4 ID parameter.
.It Do min-ttl Dc Ar value
Enforce a minimum value for the IPv4 Time To Live (TTL) parameter.
.It Do max-mss Dc Ar value
Enforce a maximum value for the MSS on TCP packets.
Typically, for "MSS clamping".
.It Dq no-df
Remove the Don't Fragment (DF) flag from IPv4 packets.
.El
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal
procedure "someproc" {
	log: npflog0
	normalize: "random-id", "min-ttl" 64, "max-mss" 1432
}
.Ed
.Pp
In this case, the procedure calls the logging and normalization modules.
.Ss Misc
Text after a hash
.Pq Sq #
character is considered a comment.
The backslash
.Pq Sq \e
character at the end of a line marks a continuation line,
i.e., the next line is considered an extension of the present line.
.Sh GRAMMAR
The following is a non-formal BNF-like definition of the grammar.
The definition is simplified and is intended to be human readable,
therefore it does not strictly represent the formal grammar.
