.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
The 
.Nm pppstats
utility reports PPP-related statistics for the specified PPP
.Ar interface .
If the
.Ar interface
is unspecified, it will default to ppp0.
.Pp
The
.Nm slstats
utility reports SLIP-related statistics for the specified SLIP
.Ar interface .
If the
.Ar interface
is unspecified, it will default to sl0.
.Pp
Otherwise
.Nm pppstats
and
.Nm slstats
function identically.  Both programs will report interface-specific
statistics at regular intervals.  The display is split horizontally
into input and output sections containing columns of statistics
describing the properties and volume of packets received and
transmitted by the interface.
.Pp
The first report will consist of a snapshot of the interface's
statistics.  Further output, if any, will describe activity between
report intervals.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar count
Repeat the display
.Ar count
times. The first display is for the time since a reboot and each
subsequent report is for the time period since the last display.  If
no
.Ar wait
interval is specified, the default is 5 seconds.
.It Fl v
Display additional statistics demonstrating the efficacy of VJ header
compression and providing more explicit information on failure
distribution.
.It Fl w Ar wait
Pause
.Ar wait
seconds between each display.  If no repeat
.Ar count
is specified, the default is infinity.
.It Fl M Ar core
Extract values associated with the name list from the specified core
instead of the default
.Pa /dev/kmem .
.It Fl N Ar system
Extract the name list from the specified system instead of the default
.Pa /netbsd .

The following fields are printed on the input side:
.Bl -tag -width search
.It Li IN
The total number of bytes received by this interface.
.It Li PACK
The total number of packets received by this interface.
.It Li COMP
The number of compressed TCP packets received by this interface.
.It Li UNCOMP
The number of uncompressed TCP packets received by this interface.
.It Li ERR
The number of packets received by this interface of unknown type.
.It Li TOSS
The number of packets dropped on reception by this interface.  Only
reported when the
.Fl v
option is specified.
.It Li IP

reported when the
.Fl v
option is specified.

.It Li PACK
The total number of packets transmitted from this interface.
.It Li COMP

.It Li UNCOMP
The number of uncompressed TCP packets transmitted from this interface.
.It Li IP
The total number of non-TCP packets transmitted from this interface.
.It Li SEARCH
The number of searches for the cached header entry for a compressed
packet.  Only reported when the
.Fl v
option is specified.
.It Li MISS
The number of failed searches for the cached header entry for a
compressed packet.  Only reported when the
.Fl v
option is specified.
