.Dt ACCTON 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm accton
.Nd enable/disable system accounting
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
With an argument naming an existing
.Ar file ,
.Nm
causes system accounting information for every process executed
to be placed at the end of the file.  If no argument is given,
accounting is turned off.
.Pp
The default accounting file is /var/account/acct.
Typically, accounting is enabled by rc scripts during the boot process.
In
.Nx ,
one may enable accounting by setting the variable
.Dq accounting
to
.Dq YES
in /etc/rc.conf.
.Pp
Note that, traditionally, the system accounting log file can not be rotated
cleanly by
.Xr newsyslog 8 .
Instead, a default installation of
.Nx
rotates /var/account/acct using the /etc/daily script.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/account/acct -compact
.It Pa /var/account/acct
Default accounting file.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr lastcomm 1 ,
.Xr acct 5 ,
.Xr sa 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command has existed nearly forever, but this man page is new.
