.Sh NAME
.Nm powerd
.Nd power management daemon for sysmon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
acts upon power management events posted by the kernel's power management
facility.
When events are posted,
.Nm
translates the event into a script name and a list of arguments.
.Nm
then runs the script in order to implement the power management policy
defined by the system administrator.
.Pp
.Nm
supports the following option:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Fl d
Enable debugging mode.
Verbose messages will be sent to stderr and
.Nm
will stay in the foreground of the controlling terminal.
.El
.Sh CONFIGURATION SCRIPTS
All of
.Nm
configuration is encapsulated into scripts that are run when power
management events occur.
.Nm
will look for these scripts in two locations.
The first location is
.Pa /etc/powerd/scripts/\*[Lt]power_type\*[Gt] ,
where
.Aq Pa power_type
is defined by the power management mechanism supported by the system,
e.g.,
.Dq apm
or
.Dq acpi .
If the script is not found in the first location,
.Nm
looks in
.Pa /etc/powerd/scripts .
.Pp
Configuration scripts are run synchronously, i.e.,
.Nm
will start the script and wait for its completion before it handles
the next event.
.Pp
Configuration scripts are called with different arguments, depending on
the script class.
These classes are described in the following sections.
.Ss POWER SWITCH SCRIPTS
Power switch scripts are called when a state change event occurs on
a power switch device.
Power switch scripts are called with two arguments: the device with which
the device is associated, and the event type.
.Pp
The following power switch script names are defined:
.Bl -tag -width "power_button"
.It power_button
This script is called when an event occurs on a power button device.
.It reset_button
This script is called when an event occurs on a reset button device.
.It sleep_button
This script is called when an event occurs on a sleep button device.
.It lid_switch
This script is called when an event occurs on a lid switch device.
.It acadapter
This script is called when an online or offline event occurs on an
AC adapter device.
.El
.Pp
The following events are defined for power switch devices:
.Bl -tag -width "released"
.It pressed
The button was pressed, the lid closed, or the AC adapter connected.
.It released
The button was released, the lid opened, or the AC adapter disconnected.
Note that power and sleep button devices usually do not
post this type of event.
.El
.Pp
The following is an example of how a power button script might be invoked
when a power button is pressed by the operator:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/etc/powerd/scripts/power_button acpi0 pressed
.Ed
.Ss ENVSYS SCRIPTS
.Xr envsys 4
scripts are called when a critical condition was triggered in
a sensor.
These scripts are called with three arguments: the
device associated, the event type, and sensor's name.
The
.Sy sensor_drive
sensor uses a fourth argument: state description.
.Pp
The following envsys script names are defined:
.Bl -tag -width "sensor_temperature"
.It sensor_battery
This script is called when an event occurs on a battery sensor (Wh/Ah).
.It sensor_drive
This script is called when an event occurs on a drive sensor.
.It sensor_fan
This script is called when an event occurs on a fan sensor.
.It sensor_power
This script is called when an event occurs on a power sensor (W/Ampere).
.It sensor_resistance
This script is called when an event occurs on a resistance sensor (Ohm).
.It sensor_temperature
This script is called when an event occurs on a temperature sensor.
.It sensor_voltage
This script is called when an event occurs on a voltage sensor.
.El
.Pp
The following event is defined for all scripts but is only sent after
a critical/warning or any other event was previously sent:
.Bl -tag -width "sensor_temperature"
.It normal
A normal state/capacity/condition was triggered.
.El
.Pp
The following events are defined for battery, fan, power, resistance,
temperature, and voltage sensors:
.Bl -tag -width "sensor_temperature"
.It critical
A critical condition was triggered.
.It critical-under
A critical under condition was triggered.
.It critical-over
A critical over condition was triggered.
.It warning-under
A warning under condition was triggered.
.It warning-over
A warning over condition was triggered.
.El
.Pp
The following events are defined for battery sensors:
.Bl -tag -width "sensor_temperature"
.It user-capacity
A capacity limit set by the user was triggered.
.El
.Pp
The following events are defined for drive sensors:
.Bl -tag -width "sensor_temperature"
.It state-changed
The state on the sensor changed and it's not in a valid state.
.El
.Pp
The following is an example of how a temperature sensor script might be
invoked when a critical over condition is triggered:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/etc/powerd/scripts/sensor_temperature lm0 critical-over "CPU Temp"
