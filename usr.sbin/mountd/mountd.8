.Sh NAME
.Nm mountd
.Nd service remote
.Tn NFS
mount requests
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dN
.Op Fl P Ar policy
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Op Ar exportsfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the server for
.Tn NFS
mount requests from other client machines.
.Nm
listens for service requests at the port indicated in the
.Tn NFS
server specification; see
.%T "Network File System Protocol Specification" ,
RFC 1094, Appendix A and
.%T "NFS: Network File System Version 3 Protocol Specification" ,
Appendix I.
.Pp
Options and operands available for
.Nm mountd :
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Enable debugging mode.
.Nm
will not detach from the controlling terminal and will print
debugging messages to stderr.
.It Fl N
Do not require privileged ports for mount or NFS RPC calls.
This option is equivalent to specifying
.Dq -noresvport -noresvmnt
on every export.
See
.Xr exports 5
for more information.
Some operating systems (notably Mac OS X) require this option.
.It Fl P Ar policy
IPsec
.Ar policy
string,
as described in
.Xr ipsec_set_policy 3 .
Multiple IPsec policy strings may be specified by using a semicolon as
a separator.
If conflicting policy strings are found in a single line,
the last string will take effect.
If an invalid IPsec policy string is used
.Nm
logs an error message and terminates itself.
.It Fl p Ar port
Force
.Nm
to bind to the given port.
If this option is not given,
.Nm
may bind to every anonymous port
(in the range 600-1023) which causes trouble when trying to use
NFS through a firewall.
.It Ar exportsfile
The
.Ar exportsfile
argument specifies an alternative location
for the exports file.
.El
.Pp
When
.Nm
is started,
it loads the export host addresses and options into the kernel
using the
.Xr nfssvc 2
system call.
After changing the exports file,
a hangup signal should be sent to the
.Nm
daemon to get it to reload the export information.
After sending the SIGHUP
(kill \-s HUP `cat /var/run/mountd.pid`),
check the syslog output to see if
.Nm
logged any parsing errors in the exports file.
.Pp
After receiving SIGTERM,
.Nm
sends a broadcast request to remove the mount list from all the clients.
This can take a long time, since the broadcast request waits for each
client to respond.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/run/mountd.pid -compact
.It Pa /etc/exports
the list of exported filesystems
.It Pa /var/run/mountd.pid
the pid of the currently running
.Nm
.It Pa /var/db/mountdtab
the list of remotely mounted filesystems
