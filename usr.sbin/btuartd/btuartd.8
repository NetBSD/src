.Sh NAME
.Nm btuartd
.Nd Bluetooth HCI UART (H4) daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl c Ar conffile
.Nm
.Op Fl f
.Op Fl i Ar init_speed
.Op Ar type
.Ar comdev speed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon configures and attaches Bluetooth HCI UART devices.
It opens
.Ar comdev
like
.Xr com 4
and compatible devices, also configures
.Ar speed
and flow.
The
.Nm
daemon supports HCI UART.
With
.Fl c
it reads the configuration file and with
.Fl d
it runs in foreground mode.
With a
.Ar comdev
argument, it configures that device.
.Pp
When the SIGHUP signal is received in daemon mode, all devices are closed,
and the daemon rereads the configuration files.
.Pp
If the
.Ar type
is given, then
.Nm
sets
.Xr btuart 4
to
.Ar type .
Otherwise that for unspecified HCI UART interface.
Supported
.Ar types
are:
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXX
.It Cm ericsson
Ericsson based modules
.It Cm digi
Digianswer based cards
.It Cm texas
Texas Instruments
.It Cm csr
Cambridge Silicon Radio Casira serial adapter or BrainBoxes serial dongle
(BL642)
.It Cm swave
Silicon Wave kits
.It Cm st
ST Microelectronics minikits based on STLC2410/STLC2415
.It Cm stlc2500
ST Microelectronics minikits based on STLC2500
.It Cm bt2000c
AmbiCom BT2000C Bluetooth PC/CF Card
.It Cm bcm2035
Broadcom BCM2035
.El
.Pp
The command line options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XXXX
.It Fl c Ar conffile
Specify the configuration file.
The default is
.Pa /etc/bluetooth/btuartd.conf .
.It Fl d
Run in foreground (do not detach).
.It Fl f
Enable flow control as
.Xr com 4 .
.It Fl i Ar init_speed
Specify the initial speed for the Bluetooth module.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -compact
.It Pa /etc/bluetooth/btuartd.conf
.It Pa /var/run/btuartd.pid
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
daemon was writen for
.Nx 4.0 .
