.Nm
.Op Fl svz
.Oo
.Ar device
.Op Ar parameters
.Oc
.Nm
.Op Fl l
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to configure Bluetooth devices.
If the
.Ar device
is given, but no parameters, then
.Nm
will print information about the device.
If no
.Ar device
is given, a basic list of devices will be printed.
.Pp
When the
.Fl l
flag is used, just the device names will be printed.
.Sh COMMANDS
The following parameters may be specified with
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxx
.It Cm up
Enable Bluetooth Device.
.It Cm down
Disable Bluetooth Device.
.It Cm pscan
Enable Page Scan.
This enables incoming connections to the device.
.It Cm -pscan
Disable Page Scan.
.It Cm iscan
Enable Inquiry Scan.
This puts the device in Discoverable mode.
.It Cm -iscan
Disable Inquiry Scan.
.It Cm encrypt
Enable encryption.
This will cause the device to request encryption on all baseband
connections, and will only work if authentication is also enabled.
.It Cm -encrypt
Disable encryption.
.It Cm auth
Enable authentication.
This will cause the device to request authentication
for all baseband connections.
.It Cm -auth
Disable authentication.
.It Cm switch
Enable Role Switching.
In a Bluetooth piconet there is one Master and up to seven Slaves, and
normally the device that initiates a connection will take the Master role.
Enabling this option allows remote devices to switch connection roles.
.It Cm -switch

.It Cm master
Request the Master role when accepting connections.
.It Cm -master
Do not request Master role.

by outgoing ACL connections.
By default, all packet types that the device supports are enabled,
see bluetooth specifications for more information if you want to change this.
.It Cm class Ar class
Set class of device.
.Ar class
is a 6 digit hex value the value of which declares the device capabilities.
See the
.Qq Assigned Numbers - Baseband
document at
.Lk http://www.bluetooth.com/
for details of constructing a Class of Device value.
