.Dt BTCONFIG 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm btconfig
.Nd configure bluetooth devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl svz
.Oo
.Ar device
.Op Ar parameters
.Oc
.Nm
.Op Fl l
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to configure Bluetooth devices.
If the
.Ar device
is given, but no parameters, then
.Nm
will print information about the device.
If no
.Ar device
is given, a basic list of devices will be printed.
.Pp
When the
.Fl l
flag is used, just the device names will be printed.
.Sh COMMANDS
The following parameters may be specified with
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxx
.It Cm up
Enable Bluetooth Device.
.It Cm down
Disable Bluetooth Device.
.It Cm pscan
Enable Page Scan.
This enables incoming connections to the device.
.It Cm -pscan
Disable Page Scan.
.It Cm iscan
Enable Inquiry Scan.
This puts the device in Discoverable mode.
.It Cm -iscan
Disable Inquiry Scan.
.It Cm encrypt
Enable encryption.
This will cause the device to request encryption on all baseband
connections, and will only work if authentication is also enabled.
.It Cm -encrypt
Disable encryption.
.It Cm auth
Enable authentication.
This will cause the device to request authentication
for all baseband connections.
.It Cm -auth
Disable authentication.
.It Cm switch
Enable Role Switching.
In a Bluetooth piconet there is one Master and up to seven Slaves, and
normally the device that initiates a connection will take the Master role.
Enabling this option allows remote devices to switch connection roles
and become the Master rather than needing to form another piconet
which may cause problems.
.It Cm -switch
Disable Role Switching.
.It Cm hold
Enable Hold Mode.
.It Cm -hold
Disable Hold Mode.
.It Cm sniff
Enable Sniff Mode.
.It Cm -sniff
Disable Sniff Mode.
.It Cm park
Enable Park Mode.
.It Cm -park
Disable Park Mode.
.It Cm name Ar name
Set human readable name of device.
.It Cm ptype Ar type
Set packet types.
.Ar type
is a 16 bit hex value specifying packet types that will be requested
by outgoing ACL connections.
By default, all packet types that the device supports are enabled,
see bluetooth specifications for more information if you want to change this.
.It Cm class Ar class
Set class of device.
.Ar class
is a 6 digit hex value the value of which declares the device capabilities.
See the
.Qq Assigned Numbers - Baseband
document at
.Dv http://www.bluetooth.com/
for details of constructing a Class of Device value.
As a starter, 0x020104 means Desktop Computer, with Networking
available.
.It Cm fixed
Set fixed pin type.
.It Cm variable
Set variable pin type.
.It Cm inquiry
Perform device Discovery from the specified device and print details.
.It Cm rssi
Enable Remote Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) in inquiry results.
This will only work if the device features indicate
.Aq RSSI with inquiry result .
.It Cm -rssi
Disable Remote Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) in inquiry results.
.It Cm reset
Perform a hard reset on the device and re-initialise system state.
.It Cm voice
Set Voice Setting.
[This should be 0x0060 for now]
.It Cm pto
Set Page Timeout value.
This is a decimal value in milliseconds.
.It Cm scomtu
Change SCO mtu value.
This is a decimal value, see
.Xr ubt 4
for reasons why you may need to do this.
.El
.Pp
All parameters are parsed before any device operations take place.
Each time the
.Fl v
flag is given, verbosity levels will be increased.
.Pp
Super-user privileges are required to change device configurations.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Messages indicating the specified device does not exist, the
requested address is unknown, or the user is not privileged and
tried to alter an device's configuration.
