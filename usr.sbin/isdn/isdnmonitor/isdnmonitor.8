.Sh NAME
.Nm isdnmonitor
.Nd isdn4bsd / isdnd remote monitoring tool
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm isdnmonitor
.Op Fl c
.Op Fl d Ar debuglevel
.Op Fl f Ar filename
.Op Fl h Ar hostspec
.Op Fl l Ar pathname
.Op Fl p Ar portspec
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to remotely monitor the operation of the ISDN demon,
.Xr isdnd 8 ,
which manages all ISDN related connection and disconnection of ISDN
devices supported by the isdn4bsd package.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Switch to (curses-) fullscreen mode of operation. In this mode,
.Nm
behaves nearly exactly as
.Xr isdnd 8
in fullscreen mode. In fullscreen mode, entering the control character
.Em Control-L
causes the display to be refreshed and entering
.Em Carriage-Return
or
.Em Enter
will pop-up a command window. Because
.Nm
will not listen to messages while the command window is active,
this command window will disappear automatically after 5 seconds without
any command key press.
.Pp
While the command window is active,
.Em Tab
or
.Em Space
advances to the next menu item. To execute a command, press
.Em Return
or
.Em Enter
for the highlighted menu item, or enter the number corresponding to the
item to be executed or enter the capitalized character in the menu item
description.
.It Fl d
If debugging support is compiled into
.Nm isdnmonitor
this option is used to specify the debugging level.
.\" The debugging level is the sum of the
.\" following values:
.\" .Pp
.\" .Bl -tag -width Ds -compact -offset indent
.\" .It Ar 0x001
.\" general debugging.
.\" .It Ar 0x002
.\" rates calculation.
.\" .It Ar 0x004
.\" timing calculations.
.\" .It Ar 0x008
.\" state transitions.
.\" .It Ar 0x010
.\" retry handling.
.\" .It Ar 0x020
.\" dialing.
.\" .It Ar 0x040
.\" process handling.
.\" .It Ar 0x080
.\" isdn4bsd kernel i/o calls.
.\" .It Ar 0x100
.\" controller and channel busy/free messages.
.\" .It Ar 0x200
.\" isdnmonitor.rc configuration file processing.
.\" .El
.\" .Pp
.\" The value can be specified in any number base supported by the
.\" .Xr sscanf 3
.\" library routine.
.Pp
In addition, this option accepts also the character 'n' as an argument to
disable displaying debug messages on the full-screen display.
.Pp
.It Fl f
Specifying this option causes
.Nm
to write its normal output and - if enabled - debugging output to a file
which name is specified as the argument.
.It Fl l
is used to specify a Unix local domain socket name to be used for communication
between
.Xr isdnd 8
and
.Nm
.It Fl h
is used to specify a hostname or a dotted-quad IP address of a machine
where an
.Xr isdnd 8
is running which should be monitored.
.It Fl p
This option may be used to specify a remote port number in conjunction
with the
.Fl h
option.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affect the execution of
.Nm isdnmonitor :
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ev TERM
The terminal type when running in full-screen display mode.
See
.Xr environ 7
for more information.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
For a first try, the following command should be used to start
.Nm
to monitor a locally running isdnd:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
isdnmonitor -h localhost
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is 0 on success, 1 on error.
