.Sh NAME
.Nm isdnd.rc
.Nd isdn4bsd ISDN connection management daemon config file format
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Pa /etc/isdn/isdnd.rc
contains (if not otherwise specified on the command line) the runtime
configuration for the
.Xr isdnd 8
ISDN connection management daemon which is part of the isdn4bsd package.
.Pp
The configuration file consists of keywords which start in column 1 followed by
one or more spaces or tabs, an equal sign, one or more spaces or tabs
and a keyword dependent parameter value.
.Pp
A line beginning with '#' is treated as a comment line.
.Pp
For keywords requiring the specification of a boolean value, the truth
value can be either
.Em yes
or
.Em on
while the false value can be either
.Em no
or
.Em off .
.Pp
The configuration file consists of one
.Em system
section, one or more optional
.Em controller
sections and one or more
.Em entry

In the
.Em system
section parameters regarding the daemon operation or parameters
not associated with a single remote connection can be set.
In the
.Em controller
section parameters regarding a particular controller can be set.
In the
.Em entry
section(s) parameters directly associated with a single remote
connection can be set.
.Pp
The following keywords are recognized by

.Em on .
See also system keyword
.Em rotatesuffix .
If this keyword is omitted the system default is used.
(optional)
.It Li aliasing

This keyword is used to specify the path/name of a mail program which
which is able to use the "-s" flag to specify a subject on its
command line.

This keyword is used to specify regular expressions.
It can be specified
more than once up to a compile time dependent value (currently set to 5 by
the MAX_RE definition in the source).
.Pp
All specified regular expressions are compared to the log strings at runtime
and if a match is found, a program is run with the log text as a parameter
(see also the keyword
.Em regprog
below).
.Pp
For an explanation how regular expressions are specified, please have a
look at
.Xr re_format 7
and
.Xr regex 3 .
The

regular expression syntax is supported here.
.Pp
Hint: it might be necessary to properly quote the expression to avoid
improper interpretation by the configuration file parser.
(optional)
.It Li regprog
This keyword is used to specify the name of a program which is run in
case a corresponding regular expression is matched by a logging string.
.Nm Isdnd
expects to find the program below the path

(optional)
.It Li rotatesuffix
Specifies a suffix for renaming the log- and the accounting-filename.
In case
rotatesuffix is used and a USR1 signal is sent to isdnd, the log-file and the
accounting file is not only closed and reopened but the old log-file is also
renamed to the former filename with the rotatesuffix string appended.
If this keyword is omitted, the log-files are just closed and reopened; this
is also the default behavior.
(optional)
.\" .It Li rtprio
.\" Specifies the real-time priority
.\" .Nm isdnd

which is prepended to the string specified as a parameter to this keyword.
(optional)
.It Li alert
is used to specify a time in seconds to wait before accepting a call.
This
keyword is only usable for incoming telephone calls (dialin-reaction = answer).

the answering machine starts to run.
The minimum value for the alert parameter
is 5 seconds and the maximum parameter allowed is 180 seconds.
(optional)
.It Li autoupdown
For network interfaces using ISDN as a transport medium it does not make
sense to mark the interfaces UP before running
.Nm isdnd .
Typically these interfaces are configured, but marked down, in the respective
.Pa ifconfig.*
file.
When starting,
.Nm isdnd
recognizes these interfaces (configured with some address, marked down, and
having a matching config entry) and marks them up.
On shutdown,
.Nm isdnd
marks all interfaces changed at startup DOWN again.
.Pp
In rare circumstances you might not want this automatic handling.
In this cases add an
.Em autoupdown=no
line to the config file entry.

The format of this file is: start time, last update time, number of calls.
(optional)
.It Li budget-calloutsfile-rotate
If set to
.Em on
rotate budget-calloutsfile every night when an attempt is made to update
the file on a new day.

The programs specified by connect and disconnect will get the following
command line arguments: -d (device) -f (flag) [ -a (addr) ] where
.Em device
is the name of device, e.g. "ippp0",
.Em flag
will be "up" if connection just got up, or "down" if interface changed to down
state and

Setting this to
.Em -1
gives an unlimited number of retries! (optional)
.It Li direction

Thus the exchange is still free to select another
than the requested channel!

Typically,
.Em idletime-incoming
is used as a last resort and is therefore set much higher than a charging
unit time: typical values are one to five minutes.
.It Li outgoing calls
Outgoing call disconnect time can be set up in one of three ways:
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Li simple mode
For simple mode, the
.Em idle-algorithm-outgoing
must be
.Em fix-unit-size
and the selected
.Em unitlength
must be 0 (zero) and
.Em idletime-outgoing
greater zero.
.Pp
The outgoing traffic is constantly monitored, and in case there was
not traffic taking place for the time in seconds specified by
.Em idletime-outgoing
the call is closed.
.Pp
Typical values in simple mode are 10 to 30 seconds.
.It Li shorthold mode for fixed unit charging
For shorthold mode, the
.Em idle-algorithm-outgoing
 must be
.Em fix-unit-size
 and the selected
.Em unitlength
and
.Em idletime-outgoing
must be greater than 0 (zero);
.Em earlyhangup
must be \*[Ge] 0 (zero).

.Ed
.Pp
During the unchecked window which is (unitlength - (idle-time+earlyhangup))
in length, no idle check is done.
After the unchecked window has ended,
the line is checked for idle-time length if no traffic takes place.
In case
there was traffic detected in the check-window, the same procedure is restarted
at the beginning of the next unit.
In case no traffic was detected during
the check-window, the line is closed at the end of the check window.
.Pp
Notice:
.Em unitlength
must (!) be greater than the sum of
.Em idletime-outgoing
and
.Em earlyhangup !
.It Li shorthold mode for variable unit charging
For shorthold mode, the
.Em idle-algorithm-outgoing
must be
.Em var-unit-size
and the selected
.Em unitlength
and
.Em idletime-outgoing
must be greater than 0 (zero);
.Pp
This shorthold mode is suitable when your calls are billed on
the elapse time of the call plus a fixed connection charge.
For example British Telecom bill this way.
.Pp
Each call is divided into two periods, the first is the
.Em unchecked
period and the second is the
.Em checked .
The
.Em checked
period starts 1 second before the first units time expires.
.Pp
During the
.Em checked
period if there is no traffic for
.Em idle-time
seconds the call is disconnected.

.Ed
.Pp
Experience shows that useful values for idle-time are from 15 to 30 seconds.
.Pp
If idle-time is too short an application that is not yet finished with the
network will cause a new call to be placed.
