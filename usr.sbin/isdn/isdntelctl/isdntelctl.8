.It Fl c

.It Fl A
Do A-law (ISDN line) -\*[Gt] mu-law (userland) conversion.
.It Fl U

The telephony data stream comes out of the line in a bit-reversed format,
so the

driver does the bit-reversion process in any case.

Additionally, the user can specify to do A-law to mu-law, mu-law to A-law
or no conversion at all in the isdntel driver by using the
.Nm
utility.
.Sh FILES
.Pa /dev/isdntel\*[Lt]n\*[Gt]
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command
.Bd -literal -offset indent
isdntelctl -g
.Ed
.Pp
displays the currently used sound format for device
.Pa /dev/isdntel0 .
