.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm schedctl
.Nd a program to control scheduling of processes and threads.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Fl p Ar pid
.Oo Fl t Ar lid Oc
.Oo Fl A Ar processors Oc
.Oo Fl C Ar class Oc
.Oo Fl P Ar priority Oc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command can be used to control scheduling of processes and threads.
It also returns the information about current scheduling parameters
of the process or thread.
Only the super-user may change the scheduling parameters.
.Pp
Available options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl p Ar pid
The target process which will be affected.
If process has more than one thread, all of them will be affected.
.It Fl t Ar lid
Thread in the specified process.
If specified, only this thread will be affected in the process.
.It Fl A Ar processors
Set of the processors on which process or thread should run, that is, affinity.
Processors are defined as numbers (starting from zero) and separated by commas.
Value of -1 is used to unset the affinity.
.It Fl C Ar class
Scheduling class (policy) might be:
.Bl -tag -width SCHEDOTHERXX
.It Dv 0: SCHED_OTHER
Time-sharing (TS) scheduling policy.
The default policy in
.Nx .
.It Dv 1: SCHED_FIFO
First in, first out (FIFO) scheduling policy.
.It Dv 2: SCHED_RR
Round robin scheduling policy.
.El
.It Fl P Ar priority
Priority which will be set for the process or thread.
For all scheduling classes, priority might be set to any value in the range from
.Dv SCHED_PRI_MIN
(0) to
.Dv SCHED_PRI_MAX
(63).
.El
.Pp
.Sh EXAMPLES
Show scheduling information about process whose ID is '123':
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# schedctl -p 123
.Ed
.Pp
Set the affinity to CPU 0 and CPU 1, policy to SCHED_RR, and priority to 63
for thread whose ID is '1' in process whose ID is '123':
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# schedctl -p 123 -t 1 -A 0,1 -C 2 -P 63
.Ed
