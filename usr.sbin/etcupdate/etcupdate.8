.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl ahlv
.Op Fl d Ar destdir
.Op Fl p Ar pager
.Op Fl s Brq Ar srcdir | Ar tgzdir | Ar tgzfile
.Op Fl t Ar temproot
.Op Fl w Ar width
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a tool that lets the administrator update the configuration and
startup files in
.Pa /etc
(and some other directories like
.Pa /dev ,
.Pa /root
and
.Pa /var )
without having to manually check and modify every file.
The administrator should run this script after performing an operating
system update (e.g. after running
.Pa make build
in
.Pa /usr/src
or after extracting new binary distribution files)
to update to the latest configuration and startup files.
.Pp
.Nm
compares the new configuration files against the currently installed files.
The user is given the option of installing, merging or deleting each
modified or missing file.
The user can also view the differences between the files.
By default, it shows the differences in the unified diff format.
The default format can be toggled to show the differences
in unified, context, or side by side formats or an user-defined
command may be used to view differences.
(And if
.Nm wdiff
is installed, it can also show differences on a word by word basis.)
.Pp
.Nm
also detects if the user installs certain special files and performs
corresponding tasks like remaking device nodes or rebuilding a database
from the
.Xr aliases 5
file.
Finally,
.Nm
runs
.Xr postinstall 8
to check the results.
.Pp
.Nm
needs a clean set of new configuration files to compare the
existing files against.
These files, called the
.Dq reference files
in this manual, may be derived from either a source or binary
distribution of
.Nx .
.Pp
If the user is updating from sources (which is the default mode),
.Nm
will first create a copy of the reference files
by running
.Pa make distribution
in
.Pa /usr/src/etc ,
installing the files to a so-called
.Pa temproot .
(See usage of the
.Fl s Ar srcdir
and
.Fl t Ar temproot
options later in this manual page.)
Although this is the default mode, it is not recommended
(see the
.Dq BUGS
section).
.Pp
Instead of using sources, it is recommended that the user should extract
one or more binary distribution sets in a special location and use those
as the reference files (see usage of the
.Fl s Ar tgzdir
option later in this manual page),
or specify one or more binary distribution sets directly
(see usage of the
.Fl s Ar tgzfile
option later in this manual page).
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width XXtXtemprootX
.It Fl a
.Nm
can automatically update files which have not been modified locally.
The
.Fl a
flag instructs
.Nm
to store MD5 checksums in
.Pa /var/etcupdate
and use these checksums to determine if there have been any
local modifications.
.It Fl d Ar destdir
Use
.Ar destdir
instead of
.Pa /
as the top of the file system hierarchy to be updated.
For example,
.Ar destdir Ns Pa /etc
will be used instead of
.Pa /etc .
.It Fl h
Prints a help text.
.It Fl l
Automatically skip files with unchanged RCS IDs.
This has the effect of leaving alone files that have been altered
locally but which have not been changed in the
reference files.
Since this works using RCS IDs, files without RCS IDs will not be
skipped even if only modified locally.
This flag may be used together with the
.Fl a
flag described above.
.It Fl p Ar pager
The pager to use when displaying files.
By default this is
.Xr more 1
but it can be changed either with this option
or by defining the
.Ev PAGER
variable.
.It Fl s Brq Ar srcdir | Ar tgzdir | Ar tgzfile
The location of the reference files, or the
.Nx
source files used to create the reference files.
This may be specified in one of three ways:
.Bl -tag -width XXsXtgzfileXX
.It Fl s Ar srcdir
The top level directory of the
.Nx
source tree.
By default this is
.Pa /usr/src
but it can be changed either with this option
or the
.Ev SRCDIR
variable.
The reference files will be created by running
.Dq "make distribution"
in the
.Ar srcdir Ns Pa /etc
directory.
Note that
.Ar srcdir
should refer to the top of the source directory tree;
earlier versions of
.Nm
expected
.Ar srcdir
to refer to the
.Pa etc
subdirectory within the source tree.
.It Fl s Ar tgzdir
A directory in which reference files have been
extracted from a binary distribution of
.Nx .
The files that are distributed in the
.Dq Pa etc.tgz
set file must be present.
The files that are distributed in the
.Dq Pa xetc.tgz
set file are optional.
The reference files from the specified directory will be copied to the
.Pa temproot
directory.
.It Fl s Ar tgzfile
The location of a set file
(or
.Dq "tgz file" )
such as
.Dq Pa etc.tgz
or
.Dq Pa xetc.tgz
from a binary distribution of
.Nx .
Each set file is a compressed archive containing reference files,
which will be extracted to the
.Pa temproot
directory.
Multiple
.Fl s
options may be used to specify multiple set files.
The
.Dq Pa etc.tgz
set file must be specified.
The
.Dq Pa xetc.tgz
set file is optional.
.El
.It Fl t Ar temproot
Specifies the location of the
.Pa temproot
directory.
This directory will be used for a temporary copy of
the reference files created by running
.Dq "make distribution"
in the source directory specified by
.Fl s Ar srcdir ,
or a temporary copy of the reference files extracted from
the binary sets specified by
.Fl s Ar tgzfile ,
or a temporary copy of the reference files from the directory specified by
.Fl s Ar tempdir .
By default this is
.Pa /tmp/temproot
but can be changed either with this option or the
.Ev TEMPROOT
environment variable.
.It Fl v
Makes
.Nm
verbose about its actions.
.It Fl w Ar width
Sets screen width used during interactive merge.
By default this is the number of columns
.Xr stty 1
reports but it can be changed either with this
option or by defining the
.Ev WIDTH
variable.
This is useful for
.Xr xterm 1
users with wider shell windows.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width IGNOREFILESXX
.It Ev TEMPROOT
Sets a default value for
.Pa temproot .
See
.Fl t
above.
.It Ev SRCDIR
The location of the
.Nx
sources files.
See
.Fl s
above.
.It Ev PAGER
The pager to use when displaying files.
See
.Fl p
above.
.It Ev WIDTH
The screen width used during interactive merge.
See
.Fl w
above.
.It Ev IGNOREFILES
A list of files that
.Nm
should ignore.
Files listed in this
variable will never be considered for updating by
.Nm .
.El
.Sh FILES
The environment variables can also be defined in the following configuration
files.
The user's personal configuration file settings override the global
settings.
.Pp
/etc/etcupdate.conf
.Pp
~/.etcupdaterc
.Sh EXAMPLES
You have just upgraded your
.Nx
host from 3.0 to 4.0 and now it's time
to update the configuration files as well.
To update the configuration files from the sources (if you have the
.Pa /usr/src/etc
directory):
.Pp
.Dl etcupdate
.Pp
The default location of the source files is
.Pa /usr/src
but this may be overridden with the
.Fl s Ar srcdir
command line argument:
.Pp
.Dl etcupdate -s /some/where/src
.Pp
To update the configuration files from binary distribution sets
do something like this:
.Pp
.Dl etcupdate -s /some/where/etc.tgz -s /some/where/xetc.tgz
.Pp
or like this:
.Pp
.Dl mkdir /tmp/temproot
.Dl cd /tmp/temproot
.Dl tar -xpzf /some/where/etc.tgz
.Dl tar -xpzf /some/where/xetc.tgz
.Dl etcupdate -s /tmp/temproot
.Pp
You have modified only few files in the
.Pa /etc
directory so you would like install most of the updates without being asked.
To automatically update the unmodified configuration files:
.Pp
.Dl etcupdate -a
.Pp
To get a better idea what's going on, use the
.Fl v
flag:
.Pp
.Dl etcupdate -v

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Nx 1.6 .
.Pp
In
.Nx 4.0 ,
the
.Fl s Ar tgzfile
option was added, the
.Fl b Ar tempdir
option was converted to
.Fl s Ar tgzdir ,
and the
.Fl s Ar srcdir
option was changed to refer to the top of the
source directory tree rather than to the
.Pa etc
subdirectory.
.Pp
In
.Nx 5.0 ,
the ability to specify multiple colon-separated files with a single
.Fl s
option was deprecated,
and options deprecated in
.Nx 4.0
were removed.
.Pp
In
.Nx 7.0 ,
the ability to specify multiple colon-separated files with a single
.Fl s
option was removed (multiple
.Fl s
options must be used instead),
and the
.Fl d Ar destdir
option was added.
.Sh AUTHORS
The script was written by
.An Martti Kuparinen
.Aq martti@NetBSD.org
and improved by several other
.Nx
users.
.Pp
The idea for this script (including code fragments, variable names etc.)
came from the
.Fx
mergemaster (by Douglas Barton).
Unlike the
.Fx
mergemaster, this does not use CVS version tags by default to compare if
the files need to be updated.
Files are compared with
.Xr cmp 1
as this is more reliable and the only way if the version numbers are the
same even though the files are different.
.\" when exactly are the version the same even though the file changes?
.\" .Pp
.Sh BUGS
If a source directory is specified via the
.Dq Fl s Ar srcdir
option (or if the
.Pa /usr/src
directory is used by default), then
.Nm
will run
.Dq "make distribution"
in the
.Pa etc
subdirectory of the source directory, but it will not use the same
options or environment variables that would be used during a full build
of the operating system.
For this reason, use of the
.Dq Fl s Ar srcdir
option is not recommended, and use of the
.Dq Fl s Ar tgzdir
or
.Dq Fl s Ar tgzfile
options is recommended.
.\" .Pp
.\" Because of the use of
.\" .Xr cmp 1
.\" to compare files, rather than CVS versions, files that are locally changed
.\" from the distribution are always considered needing to be updated.
