.Sh NAME
.Nm etcupdate
.Nd update the configuration and startup files in
.Pa /etc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl ahlv
.Op Fl b Ar srcdir
.Op Fl p Ar pager
.Op Fl s Ar srcdir
.Op Fl t Ar temproot
.Op Fl w Ar width
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a tool that lets the administrator update the configuration and
startup files in
.Pa /etc
(and some other directories like
.Pa /dev ,
.Pa /root
and
.Pa /var )
without having to manually check and modify every file.
The administrator should run this script after performing an operating
system update (e.g. after running
.Pa make build
in
.Pa /usr/src
or after extracting new binary distribution files)
to update to the latest configuration and startup files.
.Pp
.Nm
compares the new configuration files against the currently installed files.
The user is given the option of installing, merging or deleting each
modified or missing file.
.Nm
also detects if the user installs certain special files and performs
corresponding tasks like remaking device nodes or rebuilding a database
from the
.Xr aliases 5
file.
.Pp
.Nm
needs a clean set of new configuration files to compare the
existing files against.
These files, called the
.Dq reference files
in this manual, may be derived from either a source or binary
distribution of
.Nx .
.Pp
If the user is updating from sources (which is the default mode),
.Nm
will first create a copy of the reference files
by running
.Pa make distribution
in
.Pa /usr/src/etc ,
installing the files to a so-called
.Pa temproot .
(See usage of the
.Fl s Ar srcdir
and
.Fl t Ar temproot
options later in this manual page.)
.Pp
Instead of using sources, the user can also extract one or more binary
distribution sets in a special location and use those as the reference
files (see usage of the
.Fl b Ar srcdir
option later in this manual page).
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width XXtXtemprootX
.It Fl a
.Nm
can automatically update files which have not been modified locally.
The
.Fl a
flag instructs
.Nm
to store MD5 checksums in
.Pa /var/etcupdate
and use these checksums to determine if there have been any
local modifications.
.It Fl b Ar srcdir
Location of reference files extracted from a binary distribution of
.Nx .
Note that reference files in
.Pa srcdir
will be altered and removed by
.Nm
when using the
.Fl b Ar srcdir
option (as the
.Pa srcdir
directory is treated like
.Pa temproot ) .
.It Fl h
Prints a help text.
.It Fl l
Automatically skip files with unchanged RCS IDs.
This has the effect of leaving alone files that have been altered
locally but which have not been changed in the
reference files.
Since this works using RCS IDs, files without RCS IDs will not be
skipped even if only modified locally.
This flag may be used together with the
.Fl a
flag described above.
.It Fl p Ar pager
The pager to use when displaying files.
By default this is
.Xr more 1
but it can be changed either with this option
or by defining the
.Ev PAGER
variable.
.It Fl s Ar srcdir
The location of the
.Nx
sources files used to create the reference files.
By default this is
.Pa /usr/src/etc
but it can be changed either with this option
or the
.Ev SRCDIR
variable.
.It Fl t Ar temproot
Specifies the location of the
.Pa temproot
directory.
The temporary reference files created from
.Pa /usr/src/etc
will be stored there.
By default this is
.Pa /tmp/temproot
but can be changed either with this option or the
.Ev TEMPROOT
environment variable.
.It Fl v
Makes
.Nm
verbose about its actions.
.It Fl w Ar width
Sets screen width used during interactive merge.
By default this is the number of columns
.Xr stty 1
reports but it can be changed either with this
option or by defining the
.Ev WIDTH
variable.
This is useful for
.Xr xterm 1
users with wider shell windows.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width IGNOREFILESXX
.It Ev TEMPROOT
Sets a default value for
.Pa temproot .
See
.Fl t
above.
.It Ev SRCDIR
The location of the
.Nx
sources files.
See
.Fl s
above.
.It Ev PAGER
The pager to use when displaying files.
See
.Fl p
above.
.It Ev WIDTH
The screen width used during interactive merge.
See
.Fl w
above.
.It Ev IGNOREFILES
A list of files that
.Nm
should ignore.
Files listed in this
variable will never be considered for updating by
.Nm .
.El
.Sh FILES
The environment variables can also be defined in the following configuration
files.
The user's personal configuration file settings override the global
settings.
.Pp
/etc/etcupdate.conf
.Pp
~/.etcupdaterc
.Sh EXAMPLES
You have just upgraded your
.Nx
host from 1.6 to 1.6.1 and now it's time
to update the configuration files as well.
To update the configuration files from the sources (if you have the
.Pa /usr/src/etc
directory):
.Pp
.Dl etcupdate
.Pp
The default location of the source files is
.Pa /usr/src/etc
but this may be overridden with the
.Fl s Ar srcdir
command line argument:
.Pp
.Dl etcupdate -s /some/where/src/etc
.Pp
To update the configuration files from binary distribution sets
do something like this:
.Pp
.Dl mkdir /tmp/temproot
.Dl cd /tmp/temproot
.Dl tar xpzf /some/where/etc.tgz
.Dl etcupdate -b /tmp/temproot
.Pp
You have modified only few files in the
.Pa /etc
directory so you would like install most of the updates without being asked.
To automatically update the unmodified configuration files:
.Pp
.Dl etcupdate -a
.Pp
To get a better idea what's going on, use the
.Fl v
flag:
.Pp
.Dl etcupdate -v

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Nx 1.6 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The script was written by
.An Martti Kuparinen
.Aq martti@NetBSD.org
and improved by several other
.Nx
users.
.Pp
The idea for this script (including code fragments, variable names etc.)
came from the
.Fx
mergemaster (by Douglas Barton).
Unlike the
.Fx
mergemaster, this does not use CVS version tags by default to compare if
the files need to be updated.
Files are compared with
.Xr cmp 1
as this is more reliable and the only way if the version numbers are the
same even though the files are different.
.\" when exactly are the version the same even though the file changes?
.\" .Pp
.\" .Sh BUGS
.\" Because of the use of
.\" .Xr cmp 1
.\" to compare files, rather than CVS versions, files that are locally changed
.\" from the distribution are always considered needing to be updated.
