# This script helps you to update the configuration files in /etc
# after an operating system upgrade. Instead of running "make distribution"
# in /usr/src/etc (and losing your current configuration) you can easily
# see the modifications and either install the new version or merge the
# changes in to your current configuration files.
#
# This script was written by Martti Kuparinen <martti@netbsd.org> and
# improved by several other NetBSD users.
#
# The idea for this script (including code fragments, variable names etc.)
# came from the FreeBSD mergemaster (by Douglas Barton).

Usage: `basename $0` [options]

Options:

  -b srcdir    Location of the extracted sets
  -p pager     Which pager to use              (default: /usr/bin/more)
  -s srcdir    Location of the source files    (default: /usr/src/etc)
  -t temproot  Where to store temporary files  (default: /tmp/temproot)
  -w width     Screen width                    (default: 80)

  -a           Automatically update unmodified files
  -l           Automatically skip files with strictly local changes
               (this option has no effect on files lacking RCS Ids)
  -h           This help text
