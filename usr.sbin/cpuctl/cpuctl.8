.Sh NAME
.Nm cpuctl
.Nd program to control CPUs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm cpuctl
.Ar command
.Op Ar arguments
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command can be used to control and inspect the state of CPUs in the system.
.Pp
The first argument,
.Ar command ,
specifies the action to take.
Valid commands are:
.Bl -tag -width XofflineXcpunoX
.It identify Ar cpu
Output information on the specified CPU's features and capabilities.
Not available on all architectures.
.It list
For each CPU in the system, display the current state and time of the last
state change.
.It offline Ar cpuno
Set the specified CPU off line.
.Pp
Unbound LWPs (lightweight processes) will not be executed on the CPU
while it is off line.
Bound LWPs will continue to be executed on the CPU, and device interrupts
routed to the CPU will continue to be handled.
A future release of the system may allow device interrupts to be re-routed
away from individual CPUs.
.Pp
At least one CPU in the system must remain on line.
.It online Ar cpuno
Set the specified CPU on line, making it available to run unbound LWPs.
.It ucode Op Ar file
This applies the microcode patch on all CPUs.
The default filename is used if no filename is specified.
The
.Cm identify
command prints the installed version on that CPU.
On success the
.Cm identify
command show different ucode versions before and after this command.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/cpuctl -compact
.It Pa /dev/cpuctl
control device
.It Pa /libdata/firmware/x86/amd/
The directory to install the microcode file for AMD CPUs into.
The default filename is
.Pa microcode_amd.bin
for CPU families 0x10 to 0x14.
The default filename is
.Pa microcode_amd_famXXh.bin
where
.Dv XX
is the CPU family starting with 15 (hex).
Get it from
.Lk http://www.amd64.org/support/microcode.html
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Run
.Dl cpuctl identify 0
and you should see something like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cpu0: UCode version: 0x1000080
.Ed
.Pp
After applying the microcode patch with
.Dl cpuctl ucode
you can see with
.Dl cpuctl identify 0
that the patch got applied:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cpu0: UCode version: 0x1000083
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr psrset 8 ,
.Xr schedctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Nx 5.0 .
