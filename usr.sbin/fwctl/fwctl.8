.Sh NAME
.Nm fwctl
.Nd IEEE1394 control utility
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl prt
.Op Fl b Ar pri_req
.Op Fl c Ar node
.Op Fl d Ar node
.Op Fl g Ar gap_count
.Op Fl l Ar file
.Op Fl M Ar mode
.Op Fl m Ar EUI64 | hostname
.Op Fl o Ar node
.Op Fl R Ar filename
.Op Fl S Ar filename
.Op Fl s Ar node
.Op Fl u Ar bus_num
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is designed to provide a way for users to access and control
the
.Nx
IEEE1394 subsystem.
Without options,
.Nm
will output a list of devices that are/were connected to the bus.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width XmXEUI64XhostnameXX -offset indent
.It Fl b Ar pri_req
Set the
.Dv PRIORITY_BUDGET
register on all supported nodes.
.It Fl c Ar node
Show the configuration ROM on the node.
.It Fl d Ar node
Hex dump of the configuration ROM.
.It Fl f Ar node
Force specified
.Ar node
to be the root node on the next bus reset by sending a PHY config packet.
Valid values are 0 - 63.
.It Fl g Ar gap_count
Broadcast new
.Ar gap_count
by phy_config packet.
By default this value is 63 on all nodes.
Valid values are 0 - 63.
.It Fl i Ar pri_req
Set the
.Dv PRIORITY_BUDGET
register on all supported nodes.
.It Fl l Ar file
Load hex dump file of the configuration ROM and parse it.
.It Fl M Ar mode
Explicitly specify either
.Ar dv
or
.Ar mpeg
mode for the incoming stream.
Only meaningful in case of and must precede the
.Fl R
option.
If not specified, the program will try to guess.
In case of
.Dq format 0x20
error, try to force the
.Ar mpeg
mode.
.It Fl m Ar EUI64 | hostname
Set default fwmem target.
Hostname will be converted to EUI64.
.It Fl o Ar node
Send a link-on PHY packet to the node.
.It Fl p
Dump PHY registers.
.It Fl R Ar filename
Receive DV or MPEG TS stream and dump it to a file.
Use Ctrl-C to stop receiving.
Some DV cameras seem not to send the stream if a bus manager exits.
If you cannot get the stream, try the following commands:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
sysctl hw.ieee1394if.try_bmr=0
fwctl -r
.Ed
.Pp
The resulting file contains raw DV data excluding isochronous header
and CIP header.
It can be handled by the
.Pa pkgsrc/multimedia/libdv
package.
The resulting MPEG TS stream can be played and sent over a network using
the VideoLAN tool
.Pa ( pkgsrc/multimedia/vlc ) .
The stream can be piped directly to
.Nm vlc ,
see
.Sx EXAMPLES .
.It Fl r
Initiate bus reset.
.It Fl S Ar filename
Send a DV file as isochronous stream.
.It Fl s Ar node
Write to the
.Dv RESET_START
register on the node.
.It Fl t
Show the topology map.
.It Fl u Ar bus_num
Specify the IEEE1394 bus number to be operated on.
The default is bus 0.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag
.It Pa /dev/fw0.0
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Each DV frame has a fixed size and it is easy to edit the frame order.
.Pp
.Dl "fwctl -R original.dv"
.Pp
Receive a DV stream with DV camera attached.
.Pp
.Dl "dd if=original.dv of=first.dv bs=120000 count=30"
.Pp
Get first 30 frames (NTSC).
.Pp
.Dl "dd if=original.dv of=second.dv bs=120000 skip=30 count=30"
.Pp
Get second 30 frames (NTSC).
.Pp
.Dl "cat second.dv first.dv | fwctl -S /dev/stdin"
.Pp
Swap first and second 30 frames and send them to DV recorder.
.Pp
For PAL, replace
.Dq Li bs=120000
with
.Dq Li bs=144000 .
.Pp
.Dl "fwctl -R file.m2t"
.Pp
Receive an MPEG TS stream from a camera producing MPEG transport stream.
This has been tested with SONY HDR-FX1E camera that produces HD
MPEG-2 stream at 25 Mbps bandwidth.
.Pp
To send the stream from the camera over the network using TCP (which
surprisingly works better with vlc), you can use
.Dl "fwctl -R - | nc 192.168.10.11 9000"
with
.Pa pkgsrc/net/netcat
and to receive the stream, use
.Dl nc -l -p 9000 | vlc -
.Pp
To netcast via UDP, you need to use
.Pa pkgsrc/misc/buffer ,
since vlc is not fast enough to read UDP packets from
buffers and thus it experiences dropouts when run directly.
The sending side can use
.Dl "fwctl -R - | nc 192.168.10.11 9000"
and to receive the stream, use
.Dl nc -l -u -p 9000 | buffer -s 10k -b 1000 -m 20m -p 5 | vlc -
.Pp
For more information on how to work with
.Nm vlc
see its documentation.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Fx 5.0 ,
as
.Ic fwcontrol .
It was added to
.Nx 4.0
under its present name.

.Sh BUGS
This utility is still under development and provided for debugging
purposes.
Especially MPEG TS reception support is very rudimental and supports only
high-bandwidth MPEG-2 streams (fn field in CIP header equals 3).
