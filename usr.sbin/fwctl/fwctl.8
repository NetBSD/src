.Sh NAME
.Nm fwctl
.Nd IEEE1394 control utility
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl prt
.Op Fl b Ar pri_req
.Op Fl c Ar node
.Op Fl d Ar node
.Op Fl g Ar gap_count
.Op Fl l Ar file
.Op Fl m Ar EUI64 | hostname
.Op Fl o Ar node
.Op Fl R Ar filename
.Op Fl S Ar filename
.Op Fl s Ar node
.Op Fl u Ar bus_num
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is designed to provide a way for users to access and control
the
.Fx
IEEE1394 subsystem.
Without options,
.Nm
will output a list of devices that are/were connected to the bus.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width XmXEUI64XhostnameXX -offset indent
.It Fl c Ar node
Show the configuration ROM on the node.
.It Fl d Ar node
Hex dump of the configuration ROM.
.It Fl g Ar gap_count
Broadcast
.Ar gap_count
by phy_config packet.
.It Fl i Ar pri_req
Set the
.Dv PRIORITY_BUDGET
register on all supported nodes.
.It Fl l Ar file
Load hex dump file of the configuration ROM and parse it.
.It Fl m Ar EUI64 | hostname
Set default fwmem target.
Hostname will be converted to EUI64.
.It Fl o Ar node
Send a link-on PHY packet to the node.
.It Fl p
Dump PHY registers.
.It Fl R Ar filename
Receive DV stream and dump it to a file.
Use Ctrl-C to stop the receiving.
Some DV cameras seem not to send the stream if a bus manager exits.
If you cannot get the stream, try the following commands:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
sysctl hw.ieee1394if.try_bmr=0
fwctl -r
.Ed
.Pp
The resulting file contains raw DV data excluding isochronous header
and CIP header.
It can be handled by the
.Pa pkgsrc/multimedia/libdv
package.
.It Fl r
Initiate bus reset.
.It Fl S Ar filename
Send a DV file as isochronous stream.
.It Fl s Ar node
Write to the
.Dv RESET_START
register on the node.
.It Fl t
Show the topology map.
.It Fl u Ar bus_num
Specify the IEEE1394 bus number to be operated on.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag
.It Pa /dev/fw0.0
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Each DV frame has a fixed size and it is easy to edit the frame order.
.Pp
.Dl "fwctl -R original.dv"
.Pp
Receive stream.
.Pp
.Dl "dd if=original.dv of=first.dv bs=120000 count=30"
.Pp
Get first 30 frames (NTSC).
.Pp
.Dl "dd if=original.dv of=second.dv bs=120000 skip=30 count=30"
.Pp
Get second 30 frames (NTSC).
.Pp
.Dl "cat second.dv first.dv | fwctl -S /dev/stdin"
.Pp
Swap first and second 30 frames and send them to DV recorder.
.Pp
For PAL, replace
.Dq Li bs=120000
with
.Dq Li bs=144000 .

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Fx 5.0 ,
as
.Ic fwcontrol .
It was added to
.Nx 4.0
under its present name.
