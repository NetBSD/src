Blank media when possible before formatting it.
.It Fl b Ar blockingnr
Explicitly select packet size in sectors
.Pq for CD-RW only .
It is not recommended to change this from its default of 32.
.It Fl c Ar cert-num
Certify media for DVD-RAM / DV-RE.
The argument cert-num specifies:
.Bl -tag -offset indent
.It 0
no certification
.It 1
full certification
.It 2
quick certification
.El
.It Fl D

.It Fl p
Explicitly set packet format.
.It Fl R
Restart previously stopped MCD-MRW or DVD+RW background format.
.It Fl r
Recompile defect list for DVD-RAM.

Grow spare space DVD-RAM / BD-RE.
.It Fl s
Format DVD+MRW / BD-RE with extra spare space.
.It Fl w
Wait until completion of background format.
.El
.Sh NOTES
Due to the enormous varieties in optical media,
.Nm
is made as generic as possible.
This can result in confusion.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl Ic mmcformat -B -O /dev/rcd0d
.Pp
Blanks and then formats a CD-RW disc using the
.Dq old style
format command.
It is recommended to use this
.Dq old style
command unless your drive reports that it's not supported; in that case, resort
to the default
.Fl F .
Note that a CD-RW disc can be reformatted without being blanked.
Blanking switches between sequential and fixed packet writing by
erasing the disc.
This can also help to revive old discs.
.Pp
.Dl Ic mmcformat -F -M /dev/rcd0d
.Pp
Format a CD-RW or a DVD+RW to use MRW (Mount Rainier).
This format tries to hide media flaws as much as possible by
relocation.

but that tool is very hard disk oriented.
