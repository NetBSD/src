.Sh NAME
.Nm wsfontload
.Nd "load a font bitmap into the wsfont pool or a wscons display device"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Bbv
.Op Fl e Ar encoding
.Op Fl f Ar wsdev
.Op Fl h Ar height
.Op Fl N Ar name
.Op Fl w Ar width
.Op Ar fontfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility loads a font bitmap into the wsfont font pool
(or a wscons device if the device driver supports this).
The font gets assigned a name in this process which it can be referred to
by later for use on a display screen.
The font is loaded from the specified
.Ar fontfile ,
or from standard input if
.Ar fontfile
is not provided.
.Pp
The options are:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxx
.It Fl B
Specifies that the font data is ordered right-to-left byte wise.
The default is left-to-right.
.It Fl b
Specifies that the font data is ordered right-to-left bit wise.
The default is left-to-right.
.It Fl e Ar encoding
Sets the encoding of the font.
This can be either a symbolic abbreviation or a numeric value.
Currently recognized abbreviations are:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxx
.It Ql iso
ISO-8859-1 encoding
.It Ql ibm
IBM encoded fonts
.It Ql pcvt
the custom encoding of the supplemental fonts which came with the
.Bx
.Dq pcvt
console driver
.It Ql iso2
ISO-8859-2 (east european) encoding
.It Ql iso7
ISO-8859-7 (greek) encoding
.It Ql koi8r
KOI8-R (russian) encoding
.El
Per default,
.Ql iso
is assumed.
.It Fl f Ar wsdev
Specify the device to operate on.
Default is
.Pa /dev/wsfont .
.It Fl h Ar height
Sets the height of a font character in pixels.
Default is 16.
.It Fl N Ar name
Specifies a name which can be used later to refer to the font.
If none is given, the
.Ar fontfile
name is used to create one.
.It Fl v
Prints the font's properties before loading it.
.It Fl w Ar width
Sets the width of a font character in pixels.
Default is 8.
.El
.Pp
Typically, the
.Nm
utility will be executed in system startup by the
.Pa /etc/rc.d/wscons
script, controlled by the
.Pa /etc/wscons.conf
configuration file.
.Sh FILES
.Pa /etc/wscons.conf
.Pa /usr/share/wscons/fonts
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl wsfontload -N myname -h 8 -e ibm /usr/share/wscons/fonts/vt220l.808
.Pp
Load the IBM-encoded 8\(mu8-font from the
.Xr wscons 4
distribution.
This (or another 8\(mu8-font) is necessary to use the
50-line screen type on
.Xr vga 4
displays.
.Pp
.Dl wsfontload -N orator -e ibm /usr/share/wscons/fonts/orator.816
.Dl wsconsctl -dw font=orator
.Pp
Load the
.Dq orator
IBM-encoded 8\(mu16 font and switch the first console screen
(ttyE0, wsconsctl's default) to this alternate font.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr wscons 4 ,
.Xr wsconscfg 8 ,
.Xr wsconsctl 8
.Sh BUGS
Many features are missing.
.Pp
There is no way to remove a loaded font.
