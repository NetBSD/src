TRACEROUTE 1.4

Traceroute is a system administrators utility to trace the route
ip packets from the current system take in getting to some
destination system.  See the comments at the front of the
program for a description of its use.

This program uses raw ip sockets and must be run as root (or installed
setuid to root).

A couple of awk programs to massage the traceroute output are
included.  "mean.awk" and "median.awk" compute the mean and median time
to each hop, respectively.  I've found that something like

    traceroute -q 7 foo.somewhere >t
    awk -f median.awk t | xgraph

can give you a quick picture of the bad spots on a long path (median is
usually a better noise filter than mean).

Problems, bugs, questions, desirable enhancements, source code
contributions, etc., should be sent to the email address
"traceroute@ee.lbl.gov".
