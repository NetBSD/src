.Sh NAME
.Nm ac
.Nd display connect time accounting
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d | p
.Op Fl t Ar tty
.Op Fl w Ar file
.Op Ar users ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
If the file
.Pa /var/log/wtmp
exists,
a record of individual
login and logout times are written to it by
.Xr login 1
and
.Xr init 8 ,
respectively.
The program
.Nm
examines these
records and writes the accumulated connect time for all logins to the
standard output.
.Pp
Options available:
.Bl -tag -width indentXXX
.It Fl d
Display the connect times in 24 hour chunks.
.It Fl p
Display individual user totals.
.It Fl t Ar tty
Only do accounting logins on certain ttys.
The
.Ar tty
specification can start with
.Ql \&!
to indicate not this
.Ar tty
and end with
.Ql *
to indicate all similarly named ttys.
Multiple
.Fl t
flags may be specified.
.It Fl w Ar file
Read raw connect time data from
.Ar file
instead of the default file
.Pa /var/log/wtmp .
.It Ar users ...
Display totals for the given individuals
only.
.El
.Pp
If no arguments are given,
.Nm
displays the total amount of login time for all active accounts on the
system.
.Pp
The default
.Pa wtmp
file is an infinitely increasing file
unless frequently truncated.
This is normally done by the daily daemon scripts scheduled by
.Xr cron 8 ,
which rename and rotate the
.Pa wtmp
files before truncating them (and keep about a week's worth on hand).
No login times are collected, however, if the file does not exist.
.Pp
For example,
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ac -p -t "ttyd*" > modems
ac -p -t "!ttyd*" > other
.Ed
.Pp
allows times recorded in
.Pa modems
to be charged out at a different rate than
.Pa other .
