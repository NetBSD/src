.Sh NAME
.Nm wsmoused
.Nd multipurpose mouse daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d Ar device
.Op Fl f Ar conf_file
.Op Fl m Ar modes
.Op Fl n
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon provides mouse support in console, allowing copying and pasting
text.
The left mouse button is used to select text when held and you
use the right button to paste it in the active console.
.Pp
Supported options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XfXconfXfileXX
.It Fl d Ar device
specifies the device file to be used as the
.Xr wsmouse 4
device.
Defaults to
.Pa /dev/wsmouse .
.It Fl f Ar conf_file
specifies the configuration file to be used.
Defaults to
.Pa /etc/wsmoused.conf .
.It Fl m Ar modes
specifies which modes should be activated.
Mode names are given in the argument as a whitespace separated list.
Overrides the
.Sq modes
directive in the configuration file.
.It Fl n
do not fork in the background (for debugging purposes).
Overrides the
.Sq nodaemon
directive in the configuration file.
.El
.Pp
Many other details can be tuned.
See
.Xr wsmoused.conf 5
for more information.
.Pp
.Nm
is designed to be a multipurpose mouse daemon.
Functionality is provided though independant
.Em modes ,
enabled either though the
.Fl m
flag or though the
.Sq modes
property in the configuration file (the former takes precedence).
.Ss The action mode
The
.Sq action
mode executes commands upon receivement of mouse button events.
Commands can be associated on a button basis, and can differenciate between
push or release events.
.Ss The selection mode
The
.Sq selection
mode provides visual copy and paste support in text consoles when using
the
.Xr wscons 4
device.
A selection is created by clicking with the mouse primary button at any
point on the screen and dragging it while clicked.
When the button is released, the selected text is copied to an internal
buffer for further pasting with the secondary button.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/wsmoused.conf -compact
.It Pa /dev/ttyE[0-n]
tty devices
.It Pa /dev/ttyEstat
wsdisplay status notification device
.It Pa /dev/wsmouse[0-n]
mouse control device
.It Pa /etc/wsmoused.conf
default configuration file
.El
.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
When using the
.Sq action
mode, commands specified in the configuration file are executed as the
user who started the daemon.
By default, this user is
.Sq root
when using the
.Xr rc.subr 8
framework.
You should set
.Sq wsmoused_user="<some_user>"
in
.Xr rc.conf 5
to a safer user (and adjust file permissions accordingly) if the commands
you want to execute do not require superuser privileges.
An alternative is to use
.Xr su 1
as part of the command string in the configuration file.
.Pp
When enabling the kernel option
.Cd options WSDISPLAY_CHARFUNCS ,
only needed by the
.Sq selection
mode, be absolutely sure that
.Pa /dev/ttyE*
devices have restrictive permissions; the mouse uses some functions
that could allow terminal snooping if improperly set.
.Sh NOTES
The following notes apply to all work modes:
.Bl -bullet
.It
When switching from the X screen to a text terminal, there is a small
delay (five seconds) until the mouse works again.
This time is used by X
to close the mouse device properly.
.El
.Pp
The following notes apply to the
.Sq selection
mode only:
.Bl -bullet
.It
The mouse cursor is only visible for a short period of time.
It will disappear
when you stop moving it to avoid console corruption (which happens if
it is visible and there is text output).
.It
.Cd options WSDISPLAY_CHARFUNCS
is needed in your kernel configuration file.
.It
You need to change the getty program which is run in the first
virtual terminal to use
.Pa /dev/ttyE0
instead of
.Pa /dev/console .
To do this, edit
.Pa /etc/ttys
and
.Pa /etc/wscons.conf .
