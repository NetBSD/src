.Sh NAME
.Nm wsmoused
.Nd mouse console daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d Ar device
.Op Fl f Ar fifo
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl X Ar number
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon provides mouse support in console, allowing copying and pasting
text. The left mouse button is used to select text when held and you
use the right button to paste it in the active console.
.Pp
Supported options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XXXnumberX
.It Fl d Ar device
specifies which driver to use as the mouse device. It defaults to
.Pa /dev/wsmouse .
.It Fl f Ar fifo
is used to specify an optional fifo where to redirect all mouse events
(even if they have been processed). By default, no fifo is used.
.It Fl n
do not fork in the background (for debugging purposes).
.It Fl X Ar number
tells
.Nm
which virtual console holds the X server (if any). The argument
specifies the console number (the same found in
.Pa /dev/ttyE? ,
where the ? appears).
.Nm
will stop processing events when entering this console and will
continue its job when you return to any other terminal.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/wsdisplayXXX -compact
.It Pa /dev/ttyE[0-n]
tty devices
.It Pa /dev/wsmouse0
mouse control device
.It Pa /dev/ttyEstat
wsdisplay status notification device
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following are just a few examples of
.Nm
and its functionality.
.Pp
.Dl wsmoused -X 4
.Pp
Starts the mouse dameon, telling it that ttyE4 holds a X server.
.Pp
.Dl wsmoused -d /dev/wsmouse1 -f /tmp/mousefifo
.Pp
Uses
.Pa /dev/wsmouse1
device as the mouse and
.Pa /tmp/mousefifo
as the fifo where all mouse data is redirected.
.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
Be ABSOLUTELY sure that
.Pa /dev/ttyE*
devices have restrictive permissions as the mouse uses some functions
that could allow terminal snooping if improperly set.
.Sh NOTES
The mouse cursor is only visible for a short time. It will disappear
when you stop moving it to avoid console corruption if there is any
output while it is visible.
.Pp
.Cd options WSDISPLAY_CHARFUNCS
is needed in your kernel configuration file in
order to get mouse console support.
.Pp
When you return from the X screen to another terminal there is a small
time delay until the mouse works again. The delay is needed to allow X
to close the mouse device properly.
.Pp
It's needed that you change the getty program which runs in the first
virtual terminal to use
.Pa /dev/ttyE0
instead of
.Pa /dev/console .
If you do not change this, you may have problems.
You need to edit
.Pa /etc/ttys
and
.Pa /etc/wscons.conf
to make this change.
