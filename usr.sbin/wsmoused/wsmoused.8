.Sh NAME
.Nm wsmoused
.Nd mouse console daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d Ar device
.Op Fl f Ar conf_file
.Op Fl n
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon provides mouse support in console, allowing copying and pasting
text.
The left mouse button is used to select text when held and you
use the right button to paste it in the active console.
.Pp
Supported options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XXXnumberX
.It Fl d Ar device
specifies the device file to be used as the
.Xr wsmouse 4
device.
Defaults to
.Pa /dev/wsmouse .
.It Fl f Ar conf_file
specifies the configuration file to be used.
Defaults to
.Pa /etc/wsmoused.conf .
.It Fl n
do not fork in the background (for debugging purposes).
.El
.Pp
Many other details can be tuned.
See
.Xr wsmoused.conf 5
for more information.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/wsmoused.conf -compact

tty devices
.It Pa /dev/ttyEstat
wsdisplay status notification device
.It Pa /dev/wsmouse[0-n]
mouse control device
.It Pa /etc/wsmoused.conf
default configuration file
.El
.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
Be ABSOLUTELY sure that
.Pa /dev/ttyE*
devices have restrictive permissions as the mouse uses some functions
that could allow terminal snooping if improperly set.
.Sh NOTES
The mouse cursor is only visible for a short time.
It will disappear
when you stop moving it to avoid console corruption if there is any
output while it is visible.
.Pp
.Cd options WSDISPLAY_CHARFUNCS
is needed in your kernel configuration file in
order to get mouse console support.
.Pp
When you return from the X screen to another terminal there is a small
time delay until the mouse works again.
The delay is needed to allow X
to close the mouse device properly.
.Pp
It's needed that you change the getty program which runs in the first
virtual terminal to use
.Pa /dev/ttyE0
instead of
.Pa /dev/console .
If you do not change this, you may have problems.
You need to edit
.Pa /etc/ttys
and
.Pa /etc/wscons.conf
to make this change.
