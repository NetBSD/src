.Sh NAME
.Nm wsmoused.conf
.Nd mouse daemon configuration
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file configures all the features provided by the
.Xr wsmoused 8
daemon.
It is composed by a series of
.Em blocks ,
each of which defines a group of
.Em properties .
The file format is free-form: new line markers are ignored as well as
indentation.
Comments start with the
.Sq #
sign and extend until the end of line.
.Pp
A
.Em property
is like a variable assignment.
It has a name, which goes to the left of the equal sign, and a value,
which goes to the right.
The assignment ends with a semicolon.
It looks like:
.Dl name = value;
.Pp
There is no difference between string or integer values when defining them.
Booleans are specified as integers, where
.Sq 0
means false and
.Sq 1
stands for true.
Even though, the program cares about this and will emit a warning if you
have done an incorrect assignment.
Note that it will not accept unrecognized names.
.Pp
A
.Em mode
is a type of block that defines how the program behaves when run in a
specific mode.
A mode inherits properties defined in the global scope.
It has the following syntax:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mode mode_name {
        property1 = value1;
        ...
        propertyN = valueN;
}
.Ed
.Pp
Actually, there is only one recognized mode, the
.Ql sel
mode.
.Ss Properties common to all modes
The following properties can be defined in the global scope, thus
affecting all modes, or inside the mode definition, to override global
values.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It device = pathname;
The
.Xr wsmouse 4
device name to use.
Defaults to
.Pa /dev/wsmouse .
.It nodaemon = boolean;
Set to 1 to not fork in the background.
.El
.Ss Properties specific to the sel mode
The following properties are only useful when running in the
.Em sel
mode:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It fifo = pathname;
Specify an optional fifo where to redirect all mouse events, no matter
if they have been processed.
By default, no fifo is used.
.It lefthanded = boolean;
Set to 1 to swap mouse buttons, specially useful for left handed users.
.It slowdown_x = integer;
X axis slowdown.
This positive integer specifies how many events in
the vertical direction should be ignored before changing the current
column.
It defaults to 0.
.It slowdown_y = integer;
Y axis slowdown.
This positive integer specifies how many events in
the horizontal direction should be ignored before changing the current row.
It defaults to 3.
.It ttystat = pathname;
.Xr wsdisplay 4 Ns 's
notification device.
Defaults to
.Pa /dev/ttyEstat .
You will not want to change this.
.It xconsole = integer;
Virtual console number which holds the X server (if any).
The argument specifies the console number (the same found in
.Pa /dev/ttyE? ) .
Unset by default.
