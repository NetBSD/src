.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In apropos-utils.h
.Ft int
.Fn run_query_html "sqlite3 *db" "query_args *args"

is very much similar to
.Fn run_query
but with the following three differences.
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
.Nm
takes only two arguments.
.It
The snippet returned by
.Nm
uses <b> and </b> tags to highlight the matching pieces of text so that it
appears bold in a web browser.
.It
.Nm
will do limited quoting of the inline HTML fragments in the snippet.
Concretely, it will replace <, >, ", & with &lt; &gt; &quot; and &amp;
respectively.

.Sh FILES
.Bl -hang -width -compact
.It Pa /var/db/man.db
The Sqlite FTS database which contains an index of the manual pages.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Following is a code excerpt of how

can be used.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#include <apropos-utils.h>
query_args args;
char *errmsg = NULL;
int *sec_nums = {0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
args.search_str = argv[1];
args.sec_nums = sec_nums;
args.nrec = 10;
args.offset = -1;
args.machine = NULL;
args.callback = &query_callback;
args.callback_data = NULL;
args.errmsg = &errmsg;
if (run_query(db, &args) < 0)
		errx(EXIT_FAILURE, "%s", errmsg);
}

free(query);
free(errmsg);

static int
query_callback(void *data, const char *section, const char *name,
	const char *name_desc, const char *snippet, size_t snippet_length)
{
	fprintf(stdout, "%s(%s)\t%s\en%s\en\en", name, section, name_desc,
		snippet);
	return 0;
