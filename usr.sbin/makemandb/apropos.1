.Sh NAME
.Nm apropos
.Nd search the complete content of all man pages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl 123456789hilMmPpr
.Op Fl C Ar path
.Op Fl n Ar results
.Op Fl S Ar machine
.Op Fl s Ar section
.Ar query
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility performs a full text search over the complete content of all man pages.
It uses the FTS engine of Sqlite to perform the search.
The database is created with the help of the
.Xr makemandb 8
utility.
.Pp
This implementation of the
.Nm
utility is more sophisticated than the classical version.
Like modern search applications, it uses advanced techniques like stemming
and term weighting to rank the matching results in decreasing order of
relevance.
.Pp
Quotes are optional for specifying multiword queries.
.Pp
It supports the following options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl [1-9]
Search only within the specified section of manual pages.
.It Fl C Ar path
Use different
.Xr man 1
configuration file than the default,
.Pa /etc/man.conf .
.It Fl h
Turn on html formatting.
.It Fl i
Turn on terminal escape code formatting.
.It Fl l
Legacy mode: Only searches name and name description.
Does not print context and turns off formatting.
.It Fl M
Do not show the context of the match.
.It Fl m
Show the context of the match (default).
.It Fl n Ar results
Output up to the specified number of search results.
The default limit is infinity.
.It Fl P
Turn on pager formatting.
.It Fl p
Turn on pager formatting, and pipe the results through a pager (defaulting to
.Xr more 1 ) .
.It Fl r
Turn off formatting.
.It Fl S Ar machine
Limit the search to the pages for the specified machine architecture.
By default pages for all architectures are shown in the search results.
.It Fl s Ar section
Restrict the search to the specified section of the manual.
By default, pages from all sections are shown.
This option is for backwards compatibility with the classic version of apropos,
using it is equivalent to using the
.Op 123456789
options directly.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -hang -width /etc/man.conf -compact
.It Pa /etc/man.conf
The location of the Sqlite FTS database can be configured using the

and the options in it are parsed and set.
Command line options override the environment options.
.It Ev PAGER

If the
.Ev PAGER
environment variable is null or not set, the standard pagination program
.Xr more 1
will be used.
