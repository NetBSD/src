.Nm
.Op Fl 123456789Ccp
.Op Fl n Ar Number of results
.Op Fl S Ar machine
.Op Fl s Ar section
.Ar query
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility performs a full text search over the complete content of all man pages.
It uses the FTS engine of Sqlite to perform the search.
The database is created with the help of
.Xr makemandb 8
utility.
.Pp
This implementation of the
.Nm
utility is more sophisticated than the classical version of
.Nm .
Like modern search applications, it uses advanced techniques like stemming
and term weighting to rank the matching results in decreasing order of
relevance.
By default
.Nm
will only display the top 10 matches in the output.
.Pp
Quotes are optional for specifying multiword queries.
.Pp
It supports the following options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl 1
Search only within section 1 manual pages.
.It Fl 2
Search only within section 2 manual pages.
.It Fl 3
Search only within section 3 manual pages.
.It Fl 4
Search only within section 4 manual pages.
.It Fl 5
