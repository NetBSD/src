.Sh NAME
.Nm makemandb
.Nd parse the manual pages and build a search index for
.Xr apropos 1
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl floQqv
.Op Fl C Ar path
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility traverses the directories containing man pages, parses the manual
pages with the help of
.Xr mandoc 3
and builds an Sqlite database
to support full text searches by
.Xr apropos 1 .
It obtains the list of directories to traverse using the
.Fl p
option of
.Xr man 1 .
.Pp
It supports the following options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl C Ar path
Use different
.Xr man 1
configuration file than the default,
.Pa /etc/man.conf .
.It Fl f
Force rebuilding the index from scratch, pruning the existing one.
.It Fl l
Limit the parsing to only the NAME section of the pages.
This option can be used to mimic the behavior of the classic
.Xr apropos 1
and also to substantially save disk space.
.It Fl o
Use this option to optimize the index for faster search by
.Xr apropos 1
and also to significantly reduce disk space usage.
This is an expensive I/O operation.
.It Fl Q
Print only fatal error messages (i.e., when the database is left in
an inconsistent state and needs manual intervention).
.It Fl q
Print only warnings and error messages but no status updates.
.It Fl v
Enable verbose output.
This prints the name of every file being parsed
and a summary at the end of the index update.
.El
.Pp
The index generated by
.Nm
is also used by the
.Xr whatis 1
program, replacing the old
.Dq makewhatis
program.
.Ss DATABASE SCHEMA
The name of the FTS table is mandb and its schema is as follows:
.Bl -column -offset indent "Column Name" "Column Description"
.It Li section Ta The section number of the page
.It Li name Ta The name of the page from the NAME section.
.It Li name_desc Ta The one line description from the NAME section.
.It Li desc Ta The DESCRIPTION section.
.It Li lib Ta The LIBRARY section.
.It Li return_vals Ta The RETURN VALUES section.
.It Li env Ta The ENVIRONMENT section.
.It Li files Ta The FILES section.
.It Li exit_status Ta The EXIT STATUS section.
.It Li diagnostics Ta The DIAGNOSTICS section.
.It Li errors Ta The ERRORS section.
.It Li md5_hash Ta  MD5 checksum of the man page.
.It Li machine Ta The machine architecture (if any) for which the man
page is relevant.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -hang -width /etc/man.conf -compact
.It Pa /etc/man.conf
The location of the Sqlite FTS database can be configured using the
.Cd _mandb
tag.
