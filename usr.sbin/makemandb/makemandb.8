.Sh NAME
.Nm makemandb
.Nd parse the manual pages and build a search index over them
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl C Ar path
.Op Fl floqv
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility traverses the directories containing man pages, parses the manual
pages with the help of libmandoc and builds an Sqlite database
.Pa man.db
to support full text searches.
It obtains the list of directories to traverse using the
.Fl Ar path
and
.Fl p
options of
.Xr man 1 .
.Pp
It supports the following options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl C Ar path
Use different
.Xr man 1
configuration file than the default,
.Pa /etc/man.conf .
.It Fl f
Force rebuilding the index from scratch, pruning the existing one.
.It Fl l
Limit the parsing to only the NAME section of the pages.
This option can be used to mimic the behavior of the classic
.Xr apropos 1
and also to substantially save disk space.
.It Fl o
Use this option to optimize the index for speed and also
to significantly reduce disk space usage.
This is a somewhat expensive operation.
.It Fl q
Print only error messages and no status updates.
.It Fl v
Enable verbose output.
This prints the name of every file being parsed.
.El
.Pp
As the database file is stored under
.Pa /var/db ,
root privileges are required to run
.Nm .
.Ss DATABASE SCHEMA
The name of the FTS table is mandb and its schema is as follows:
.Bl -column -offset indent "Column Name" "Column Description"
.It Li section Ta The section number of the page
.It Li name Ta The name of the page from the NAME section.
.It Li name_desc Ta The one line description from the NAME section.
