.Sh NAME
.Nm makemandb
.Nd parse the manual pages and build a search index for
.Xr apropos 1
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl floQqv
.Op Fl C Ar path
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility traverses the directories containing man pages, parses the manual
pages with the help of libmandoc and builds an Sqlite database
to support full text searches by
.Xr apropos 1 .
It obtains the list of directories to traverse using the
.Fl Ar path
and
.Fl p
options of
.Xr man 1 .
.Pp
It supports the following options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl C Ar path
Use different
.Xr man 1
configuration file than the default,
.Pa /etc/man.conf .
.It Fl f
Force rebuilding the index from scratch, pruning the existing one.
.It Fl l
Limit the parsing to only the NAME section of the pages.
This option can be used to mimic the behavior of the classic
.Xr apropos 1
and also to substantially save disk space.
.It Fl o
Use this option to optimize the index for speed and also
to significantly reduce disk space usage.
This is a somewhat expensive operation.
.It Fl Q
Print only fatal error messages (i.e., when the database is left in
an inconsistent state and needs manual intervention).
.It Fl q
Print only warnings and error messages but no status updates.
.It Fl v
Enable verbose output.
This prints the name of every file being parsed
and a summary at the end of the index update.
.El
