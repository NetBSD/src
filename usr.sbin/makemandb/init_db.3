.Sh NAME
.Nm init_db
.Nd open apropos database connection
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In apropos-utils.h
.Ft sqlite3 *
.Fn init_db "int db_flag" "char *manconf"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn init_db
function will try to initialize a connection to
.Pa man.db
which is an
Sqlite database and return a pointer to a sqlite3 structure.
The connection should subsequentially be closed by calling
.Fn close_db
which will also release any resources being used by it.
.Pp
The argument
.Fa db_flag
can be one of the following:
.Bl -hang -width -compact
.It Dv MANDB_READONLY
This will open the database in read-only mode.
Use this when you only want to query the database.
.It Dv MANDB_WRITE
This will open the database in read/write mode.
.It Dv MANDB_CREATE
This will open the database in read/write mode, and will also create
the database schema if it does not exist already.
.El
.Pp
The second argument
.Fa manconf
specifies the location of the man.conf configuration file.
By default it is stored at
.Pa /etc/man.conf .
The location of the man.db database is configured in the configuration file
using the
.Cd _mandb
tag.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On successful execution the
.Fn init_db
function will return a pointer to a sqlite3 structure which represents
a connection to the database.
.Pp
In case the man.db file does not exist and
.Dv DB_CREATE
is not used as a value of
.Fa db_flag ,
.Dv NULL
will be returned.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -hang -width /etc/man.conf -compact
.It Pa /etc/man.conf
The location of the Sqlite FTS database can be configured using the
.Cd _mandb
tag.
