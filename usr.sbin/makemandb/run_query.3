.Dt RUN_QUERY 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm run_query
.Nd run a query against
.Pa /var/db/man.db
and process the results in a callback function.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In apropos-utils.h
.Ft int
.Fn run_query "sqlite3 *db" "query_format fmt" "query_args *args"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn run_query
function prepares the user supplied query in a form suitable to be run
against
.Pa /var/db/man.db
and executes the query.
For each row obtained in the result set,
.Fn run_query
will call the user supplied callback function, which should contain the
logic for processing the data thus obtained.
.Pp
The
.Fn run_query
function takes following arguments:
.Bl -tag -width 8n
.It Fa sqlite3 *db
Handle to the database connection which can be obtained by calling
.Fn init_db .
.It Fa query_format fmt
An enum value
indicating the output format.
Currently you can specify following values:
.Bl -hang -width compact
.It Dv APROPOS_PAGER
.It Dv APROPOS_TERM
.It Dv APROPOS_HTML
.It Dv APROPOS_NONE
.El
.It Fa query_args *args
.Ft query_args
is a struct which is defined in
.Pa apropos-utils.h .
It has the following fields:
.Bl -tag -width 8n -offset indent
.It Li const char *search_str
This is the query as entered by the user.
You may want to pre-process it to do sanitization etc.
.It Li int *sec_nums
This is an array of
.Ft int
wherein each index element represents the
section number in which search should be performed.
The sections whose corresponding index element in this array is set to
.Dv NULL
are not searched.
If all the elements in the array are
.Dv 0
then all the sections are searched.
Alternatively pass
.Dv NULL
as to search in all the sections.
.It Li int nrec
This specifies the number of matching rows to fetch from the database.
Specify a negative value to fetch all the matching rows.
.It Li int offset
This specifies the offset within the result-set.
Use it to specify the position
from where to start processing the result-set.
For example if the value of nrec is m and value of offset is n, then the first
n records from the result-set will be omitted and rest m-n (or less) records will
be available for processing inside the callback.
Use a negative value if you don't wish to offset any records.
.It Li int legacy
If the output should be in legacy format (similary to classic apropos).
.It Li const char *machine
The machine architecture to which the searches should be restricted.
Specify NULL if the search should not be restricted a particular machine architecture.
.It Li int (*callback) (void *, const char *, const char *, const char *,\
const char *, size_t)
This is the callback function which will
be called for each row retrieved from the database.
The function should return a value of 0 on successful execution.
A non-zero return value will indicate a failure and
.Fn run_query
will return.
The interface of the callback function is described later in this section.
.It Li void *callback_data
Use this argument to pass any data to the callback function.
It can be retrieved inside the callback function from its first argument.
.It Li char **errmsg
If an error occurs while fetching the data from the database,
a human readable error message will be stored in
.Fa errmsg .
If no error occurs then
.Fa errmsg
will be set to
.Dv NULL .
In case
.Fa errmsg
is not
.Dv NULL ,
then the caller should make sure to free it.
.El
.El
.Pp
The interface of the callback function is
.Ft int
.Fn (*callback) "void *callback_data" "const char *section" "const char *name"\
"const char *name_desc" "const char *snippet" "size_t snippet_length"
.Pp
Its arguments are:
.Bl -column -offset indent "Function" "Argument Description"
.It Li void *callback_data Ta This is the caller supplied data.
.It Li const char *section Ta Ta \&It is the section number to which this man
page belongs.
.It Li const char *name Ta This is the name of the man page
.It Li const char *name_desc Ta This is the one line description of this man
page obtained from its NAME section.
.It Li const char *snippet Ta This is a snippet of the matching text from this
man page.
.It Li size_t snippet_length Ta This is the length of the snippet.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On successful execution the
.Fn run_query
function will return 0 and in case of an error \-1 will be returned.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -hang -width /var/db/man.db -compact
.It Pa /var/db/man.db
The SQLite FTS database which contains an index of the manual pages.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Following is a code excerpt of how
.Pa apropos.c
uses
.Fn run_query .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#include <apropos-utils.h>
query_args args;
char *errmsg = NULL;
int *sec_nums = {0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
args.search_str = argv[1];
args.sec_nums = sec_nums;
args.nrec = 10;
args.offset = -1;
args.machine = NULL;
args.callback = &query_callback;
args.callback_data = NULL;
args.errmsg = &errmsg;
if (run_query(db, APROPOS_PAGER, &args) < 0)
		errx(EXIT_FAILURE, "%s", errmsg);
}

free(query);
free(errmsg);

static int
query_callback(void *data, const char *section, const char *name,
	const char *name_desc, const char *snippet, size_t snippet_length )
{
	/* The user supplied data could be obtained as follows */
	// my_data *buf = (my_data *) data;

	fprintf(stdout, "%s(%s)\t%s\en%s\en\en", name, section, name_desc,
		snippet);
	return 0;
}
