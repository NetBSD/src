.SH NAME
mrinfo \- Displays configuration info from a multicast router
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /usr/sbin/mrinfo
[
.B \-d
.I debug_level
] [
.B \-r
.I retry_count
] [
.B \-t
.I timeout_count
]
.B multicast_router

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I mrinfo
attempts to display the configuration information from the multicast router
.I multicast_router.
.PP
.I mrinfo
uses the ASK_NEIGHBORS IGMP message to the specified multicast router. If this
multicast router responds, the version number and a list of their neighboring
multicast router addresses is part of that response. If the responding router
has a recent multicast version number, then
.I mrinfo
requests additional information such as metrics, thresholds, and flags from the
multicast router. Once the specified multicast router responds, the
configuration is displayed to the standard output.

.SH INVOCATION
.PP
"\-d" option sets the debug level. When the debug level is greater than the
default value of 0, addition debugging messages are printed. Regardless of
the debug level, an error condition, will always write an error message and will
cause
.I mrinfo
to terminate.
Non-zero debug levels have the following effects:
.IP "level 1"
packet warnings are printed to stderr.
.IP "level 2"
all level 1 messages plus notifications down networks are printed to stderr.
.IP "level 3"
all level 2 messages plus notifications of all packet
timeouts are printed to stderr.
.PP
"\-r retry_count" sets the neighbor query retry limit. Default is 3 retry.
.PP
"\-t timeout_count" sets the number of seconds to wait for a neighbor query
reply. Default timeout is 4 seconds.
.PP
.SH SAMPLE OUTPUT
.nf
.I mrinfo mbone.phony.dom.net
127.148.176.10 (mbone.phony.dom.net) [version 3.3]:
 127.148.176.10 -> 0.0.0.0 (?) [1/1/querier]
 127.148.176.10 -> 127.0.8.4 (mbone2.phony.dom.net) [1/45/tunnel]
 127.148.176.10 -> 105.1.41.9 (momoney.com) [1/32/tunnel/down]
 127.148.176.10 -> 143.192.152.119 (mbone.dipu.edu) [1/32/tunnel]
.fi
.PP
For each neighbor of the queried multicast router, the IP of the queried router
is displayed, followed by the IP and name of the neighbor. In square brackets
the metric (cost of connection), the threshold (multicast ttl) is displayed. If
the queried multicast router has a newer version number, the type (tunnel,
srcrt) and status (disabled, down) of the connection is displayed.

.I mrinfo
