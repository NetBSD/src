.Sh NAME
.Nm lptctl
.Nd manipulate lpt devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm lptctl Ar device Op Ar command Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to manipulate lpt devices so that a user can change how a
printer that is attached to a parallel port works.
If no command-argument pairs are specified, the status of the device
is printed to standard output.
The status information is also output after commands are carried out.
.Sh DEVICE COMMANDS
Multiple command-argument pairs can be specified.
Available commands are:
.Bl -item
.It
.Cm mode
.Ar standard | nibble | ps2 | fast | ecp | epp
.Pp
Sets port to use a mode of operation: standard centronics mode
(standard), nibble mode, bidirectional mode (ps2), fast centronics
mode (fast), enhanced capabilities port mode (ecp), or enhanced
parallel port mode (epp).
.It
.Cm dma
.Ar yes | no
.Pp
Enables or disables DMA.
Note DMA is only used in some advanced
modes such as ECP, and only if interrupts are enabled too.
.It
.Cm ieee
.Ar yes | no
.Pp
Enables or disables the use of
.Tn IEEE 1284
negotiations during mode changes and channel direction changes.
.It
.Cm intr
.Ar yes | no
.Pp
Enables or disables use of interrupts for port operation.
If interrupts are disabled, polling is used for data transfers.
Default setting depends on device, but polling is commonly preferred.
.It
.Cm prime
.Ar yes | no
.Pp
Enables (default) or disables printer initialization sequence
on device open.
Note the initialization sequence is never done
on open of control lpt device.
.It
.Cm autolf
.Ar yes | no
.Pp
Enables or disables (default) automatic LF on CR for data transfers.
.El

.Bl -item

.Sh HISTORY
A similar utility called
.Nm lptcontrol
exists in
.Fx
to control the
.Xr lpt 4
device.
While similar in concept, the implementations are independent.
.Nm
was added in
.Nx 2.0 .

.Nm
utility were written by
