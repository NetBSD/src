file defines the default values used by the user management tools,
.Xr useradd 8

.Pp
Options in this file can be set by manually editing
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
or using the

.Pp
.Bl -tag -width preserveX
.It Ic base_dir
sets the base directory name, in which new users' home directories
are created when using the

.It Ic class
sets the default login class for new users.
See
.Xr login.conf 5
for more information on user login classes.
.It Ic expire
sets the default time at which the current password expires.
This can be used to implement password aging.
Both the
.Ar expire
and
.Ar inactive
fields should be entered in the form
.Dq month day year ,
where month is the month name (the first three characters are
sufficient), day is the day of the month, and year is the year.
Time in seconds since the epoch (UTC) is also valid.
A value of 0 can be used to disable this feature.
.It Ic group
sets the default primary group for new users.
If this is
.Ql =uid ,
then a uid and gid will be picked which are both unique
and the same, and a line will be added to
.Pa /etc/group
to describe the new group.
It has the format:
.br
.Bd -ragged -offset indent -compact
.Ic group
.Ar gid | name | Li =uid
.Ed
.It Ic homeperm
sets the default permissions of the newly created home directory if
.Fl m
is given to
.Xr useradd 8 .
The permission is specified as an octal number, with or without a leading zero.
.It Ic inactive
sets the default time at which new accounts expire.
A value of 0 can be used to disable this feature.
Also see the
.Ar expire
field.
.It Ic password
specifies an already-encrypted default password.
.It Ic preserve
If this value is one of
.Ql true ,
.Ql yes ,
or a non-zero number, then the user login information will be
preserved when removing a user with
.Xr userdel 8 .
.It Ic range
specifies the uid boundaries for new users.
If unspecified, the default is
.Dq 1000..60000 .
It has the format:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent -compact
.Ic range Ar starting-uid Ns Li .. Ns Ar ending-uid
.Ed
.It Ic gid_range
specifies the gid boundaries for new groups.
If unspecified, the default is
.Dq 1000..60000 .
It has the format:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent -compact

.Ed
.It Ic shell
sets the default login shell for new users.
.It Ic skel_dir
sets the default skeleton directory in which to find files
with which to populate the new user's home directory.

.Ss SYNTAX

.Nm
