.Sh NAME
.Nm pcictl
.Nd a program to manipulate the PCI bus
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar pcibus
.Ar command
.Oo
.Ar arg Oo ...
.Oc
.Oc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
allows a user or system administrator to access various resources
on a PCI bus.
.Pp
The following commands are available:
.Pp
.Cm list
.Op Fl Nn
.Op Fl b Ar bus
.Op Fl d Ar device
.Op Fl f Ar function
.Pp
List the devices in the PCI domain, either as names or, if
.Fl n
is given, as numbers.
The bus, device, and function
numbers may be specified by flags.
Any locator not specified defaults
to a wildcard, or may be explicitly wildcarded by specifying
.Dq any .
If
.Fl N
is given, the driver name for this PCI device will be listed
if any driver is attached.
.Pp
.Cm dump
.Op Fl b Ar bus
.Fl d Ar device
.Op Fl f Ar function
.Pp
Dump the PCI configuration space for the specified device located
at the specified bus, device, and function.
If the bus is not specified, it defaults to the bus number of the
PCI bus specified on the command line.
If the function is not specified, it defaults to 0.
.Pp
.Cm read
.Op Fl b Ar bus
.Fl d Ar device
.Op Fl f Ar function
.Ar reg
.Pp
Read the specified 32-bit aligned PCI configuration register and print
it in hexadecimal to standard output.
If the bus is not specified, it defaults to the bus number of the
PCI bus specified on the command line.
If the function is not specified, it defaults to 0.
.Pp
.Em WARNING :
.Nm
.Cm read
is a dangerous command that can damage hardware and panic the operating
system, even though it appears to be a harmless read-only operation.
It is meant as a diagnostic tool for experiments or to debug device
drivers.
Do not use it as a substitute for a device driver!
.Pp
.Cm write
.Op Fl b Ar bus
.Fl d Ar device
.Op Fl f Ar function
.Ar reg
.Ar value
.Pp
Write the specified value to the specified 32-bit aligned PCI
configuration register.
If the bus is not specified, it defaults to the bus number of the
PCI bus specified on the command line.
If the function is not specified, it defaults to 0.

.Pp
.Dl pcictl pci0 list
.Pp
This shows all PCI devices on the system, including attached drivers:
.Pp
.Dl pcictl pci0 list -N
.Sh SEE ALSO
