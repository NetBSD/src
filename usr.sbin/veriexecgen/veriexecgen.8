.Sh NAME
.Nm veriexecgen
.Nd generate fingerprints for Veriexec
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl AaDrSTvW
.Op Fl d Pa dir
.Op Fl f Pa file
.Op Fl o Pa fingerprintdb
.Op Fl p Pa prefix
.Op Fl t Ar algorithm
.Nm
.Op Fl h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
can be used to create a fingerprint database for use with
.Em Veriexec .
.Pp
If no command line arguments were specified,
.Nm
will resort to default operation, implying
.Fl D Fl o Ar /etc/signatures Fl t Ar sha256 .
.Pp
If the output file already exists,
.Nm
will save a backup copy in the same file only with a
.Dq .old
suffix.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl p Ar prefix"
.It Fl A
Append to the output file, don't overwrite it.
.It Fl a
Add fingerprints for non-executable files as well.
.It Fl D
Search system directories,
.Pa /bin ,
.Pa /sbin ,
.Pa /usr/bin ,
.Pa /usr/sbin ,
.Pa /lib ,
.Pa /usr/lib ,
.Pa /libexec ,
and
.Pa /usr/libexec .
.It Fl d Ar dir
Scan for files in
.Ar dir .
Multiple uses of this flag can specify more than one directory.
.\" .It Fl F
.\" Try to guess the correct flags for every file.
.It Fl f Ar file
Read files from
.Ar file ,
or if
.Ar file
is "-" read from
.Ar stdin .
.It Fl h
Display the help screen.
.It Fl o Ar fingerprintdb
Save the generated fingerprint database to
.Ar fingerprintdb .
.It Fl p Ar prefix
When storing files in the fingerprint database,
store the full pathnames of files with the leading
.Dq prefix
of the filenames removed.
.It Fl r
Scan recursively.
.It Fl S
Set the immutable flag on the created signatures file when done writing it.
.It Fl T
Put a timestamp on the generated file.
.It Fl t Ar algorithm
Use
.Ar algorithm
for the fingerprints.
Must be one of
.Dq sha256 ,
.Dq sha384 ,
or
.Dq sha512 .
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
Print messages describing what operations are being done.
.It Fl W
By default,
.Nm
will exit when an error condition is encountered.
This option will
treat errors such as not being able to follow a symbolic link,
not being able to find the real path for a directory entry, or
not being able to calculate a hash of an entry as a warning,
rather than an error.
If errors are treated as warnings,
.Nm
will continue processing.
The default behaviour is to treat errors as fatal.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Pa /etc/signatures
.Sh EXAMPLES
Fingerprint files in the common system directories using the default hashing
algorithm
.Dq sha256
and save to the default fingerprint database in
.Pa /etc/signatures :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# veriexecgen
.Ed
.Pp
Fingerprint files in
.Pa /etc ,
appending to the default fingerprint database:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# veriexecgen -A -a -d /etc
.Ed
.Pp
Fingerprint files in
.Pa /path/to/somewhere using
.Dq sha512
as the hashing algorithm, saving to
.Pa /etc/somewhere.fp :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# veriexecgen -d /path/to/somewhere -t sha512 -o /etc/somewhere.fp
