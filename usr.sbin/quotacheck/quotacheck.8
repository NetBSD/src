.Sh NAME
.Nm quotacheck
.Nd filesystem quota consistency checker
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl gquv
.Ar filesystem Ar ...
.Nm
.Op Fl gquv
.Op Fl l Ar maxparallel
.Fl a
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
examines each filesystem,
builds a table of current disk usage,
and compares this table against that recorded
in the disk quota file for the filesystem.
If any inconsistencies are detected, both the
quota file and the current system copy of the
incorrect quotas are updated (the latter only
occurs if an active filesystem is checked).
By default both user and group quotas are checked.
.Pp
Available options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
If the
.Fl a
flag is supplied in place of any filesystem names,
.Nm
will check all the filesystems indicated in
.Pa /etc/fstab
to be read-write with disk quotas.
By default only the types of quotas listed in
.Pa /etc/fstab
are checked.
See also
.Fl l .
.It Fl g
Only group quotas listed in
.Pa /etc/fstab
are to be checked.
See also
.Fl u .
.It Fl l Ar maxparallel
Limit the number of parallel checks to the number specified in
the following argument.
By default, the limit is the number of disks, running one process
per disk.
If a smaller limit is given, the disks are checked round-robin,
one file system at a time.
This option is only valid with
.Fl a .
.It Fl q
.Nm
runs more quickly,
particularly on systems with sparse user id usage,
but fails to correct quotas for users [groups]
not in the system user [group] database,
and owning no files on the filesystem,
if the quota file incorrectly believes that they do.
.It Fl u
Only user quotas listed in
.Pa /etc/fstab
are to be checked.
See also
.Fl g .
.It Fl v
.Nm
is more verbose,
and reports corrected discrepancies between the
calculated and recorded disk quotas.
.El
.Pp
Specifying both
.Fl g
and
.Fl u
is equivalent to the default.
Parallel passes are run on the filesystems required,
using the pass numbers in
.Pa /etc/fstab
in an identical fashion to
.Xr fsck 8 .
.Pp
Normally
.Nm
operates silently.
.Pp
.Nm
expects each filesystem to be checked to have a
quota files named
.Pa quota.user
and
.Pa quota.group
which are located at the root of the associated file system.
These defaults may be overridden in
.Pa /etc/fstab .
If a file is not present,
.Nm
will create it.
.Pp
.Nm
is normally run at boot time from the
.Pa /etc/rc
file, see
.Xr rc 8 ,
before enabling disk quotas with
.Xr quotaon 8 .
.Pp
.Nm
accesses the raw device in calculating the actual
disk usage for each user.
Thus, the filesystems
checked should be quiescent while
.Nm
is running.
.Pp
If
.Nm
receives a
.Dv SIGINFO
signal
(see the
.Sy status
argument for
.Xr stty 1 ) ,
a line will be written to the standard error output indicating
the name of the device currently being checked and progress information.
