.Sh NAME
ipnat \- user interface to the NAT
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ipnat
.Op Fl lnrsvCF
.Fl f Ar filename
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
.Nm
opens the filename given (treating
.Dq -
as stdin) and parses the
file for a set of rules which are to be added or removed from the IP NAT.
.PP
Each rule processed by
.Nm
is added to the kernels internal lists if there are no parsing problems.
Rules are added to the end of the internal lists, matching the order in
which they appear when given to
.Nm Ns .
.Pp
.Sy Please Note
That
.Nm
is not functional without
.Xr ipf 8
running.  In addition, the following kernel options need to be turned on
in order to use
.Nm Ns :
.Em GATEWAY ,
.Em IPFORWARDING
and
.Em PFIL_HOOKS .
The
.Xr sysctl
.Pp
.Dl Dq "sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding
.Pp
will inform you if
.Em IPFORWARDING
is currently turned on in your kernel.  Please see
.Xr options 4
and
.Xr sysctl 8
for more information on turning these parameters on.
