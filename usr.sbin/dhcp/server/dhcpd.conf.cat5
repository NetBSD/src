       dhcpd.conf - dhcpd configuration file

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The dhcpd.conf file contains configuration information for
       _d_h_c_p_d_, the Internet Software Consortium DHCP Server.

       The dhcpd.conf file is a free-form ASCII text  file.    It
       is  parsed  by  the  recursive-descent  parser  built into
       dhcpd.   The file may contain extra tabs and newlines  for
       formatting purposes.  Keywords in the file are case-insen­
       sitive.   Comments may be placed anywhere within the  file
       (except  within quotes).   Comments begin with the # char­
       acter and end at the end of the line.

       The file essentially consists of  a  list  of  statements.
       Statements fall into two broad categories - parameters and
       declarations.

       Parameter statements either say how to do something (e.g.,
       how long a lease to offer), whether to do something (e.g.,
       should dhcpd provide addresses  to  unknown  clients),  or
       what  parameters to provide to the client (e.g., use gate­
       way 220.177.244.7).

       Declarations are used to describe the topology of the net­
       work,  to  describe  clients  on  the  network, to provide
       addresses that can be assigned to clients, or to  apply  a
       group  of  parameters to a group of declarations.   In any
       group of parameters and declarations, all parameters  must
       be specified before any declarations which depend on those
       parameters may be specified.

       Declarations about network topology include the
        _s_h_a_r_e_d_-_n_e_t_w_o_r_k and the _s_u_b_n_e_t declarations.   If  clients
       on  a  subnet  are to be assigned addresses dynamically, a
       _r_a_n_g_e declaration must appear within the  _s_u_b_n_e_t  declara­
       tion.   For clients with statically assigned addresses, or
       for installations where only known clients will be served,
       each such client must have a _h_o_s_t declaration.   If param­
       eters are to be applied to a group of  declarations  which
       are  not related strictly on a per-subnet basis, the _g_r_o_u_p
       declaration can be used.

       For every subnet which will be served, and for every  sub­
       net  to  which the dhcp server is connected, there must be
       one _s_u_b_n_e_t declaration, which tells dhcpd how to recognize
       that  an  address is on that subnet.  A _s_u_b_n_e_t declaration
       is required for each subnet even if no addresses  will  be
       dynamically allocated on that subnet.

       Some  installations  have  physical networks on which more
       than one IP subnet operates.   For example, if there is  a
       site-wide requirement that 8-bit subnet masks be used, but



                                                                1

       a department  with  a  single  physical  ethernet  network
       expands  to the point where it has more than 254 nodes, it
       may be necessary to run two 8-bit subnets on the same eth­
       ernet  until  such  time  as a new physical network can be
       added.   In this case, the _s_u_b_n_e_t declarations  for  these
       two  networks may be enclosed in a _s_h_a_r_e_d_-_n_e_t_w_o_r_k declara­
       tion.

       Some sites may have departments which have clients on more
       than  one  subnet,  but it may be desirable to offer those
       clients a uniform set of parameters  which  are  different
       than  what  would be offered to clients from other depart­
       ments on the same subnet.    For  clients  which  will  be
       declared explicitly with _h_o_s_t declarations, these declara­
       tions can be enclosed in a _g_r_o_u_p  declaration  along  with
       the  parameters which are common to that department.   For
       clients whose  addresses  will  be  dynamically  assigned,
       class  declarations  and  conditional  declarations may be
       used to group parameter assignments based  on  information
       the client sends.

       When  a  client  is  to be booted, its boot parameters are
       determined by consulting that  client's  _h_o_s_t  declaration
       (if  any),  and then consulting the any _c_l_a_s_s declarations
       matching the client, followed  by  the  _p_o_o_l,  _s_u_b_n_e_t  and
       _s_h_a_r_e_d_-_n_e_t_w_o_r_k declarations for the IP address assigned to
       the client.   Each of these  declarations  itself  appears
       within  a lexical scope, and all declarations at less spe­
       cific lexical scopes are also consulted for client  option
       declarations as well.   Scopes are never considered twice,
       and if parameters are declared in more than one scope, the
       parameter  declared  in the most specific scope is the one
       that is used.

       When dhcpd tries to find a _h_o_s_t declaration for a  client,
       it  first  looks for a _h_o_s_t declaration which has a _f_i_x_e_d_-
       _a_d_d_r_e_s_s parameter which matches the subnet or shared  net­
       work  on which the client is booting.   If it doesn't find
       any such entry, it then tries to find an entry  which  has
       no  _f_i_x_e_d_-_a_d_d_r_e_s_s  parameter.   If no such entry is found,
       then dhcpd acts as if there is no entry in the  dhcpd.conf
       file  for  that client, even if there is an entry for that
       client on a different subnet or shared network.

       A typical dhcpd.conf file will look something like this:

       Notice that at the beginning of the file, there's a  place
       for  global  parameters.    These might be things like the
       organization's domain name,  the  addresses  of  the  name
       servers  (if  they are common to the entire organization),
       and so on.   So, for example:

            option domain-name "isc.org";
            option domain-name-servers ns1.isc.org, ns2.isc.org;

                                Figure 2

       As you can see in Figure 2, you can specify host addresses
       in  parameters  using their domain names rather than their
       numeric IP addresses.  If a  given  hostname  resolves  to
       more  than  one  IP address (for example, if that host has
       two  ethernet  interfaces),  then  where  possible,   both
       addresses are supplied to the client.

       The most obvious reason for having subnet-specific parame­
       ters as shown in Figure 1 is that each subnet,  of  neces­
       sity,  has  its own router.   So for the first subnet, for
       example, there should be something like:

            option routers 204.254.239.1;

       Note that  the  address  here  is  specified  numerically.
       This is not required - if you have a different domain name
       for  each  interface  on  your  router,   it's   perfectly



                                                                3





dhcpd.conf(5)                                       dhcpd.conf(5)


       legitimate  to  use  the  domain  name  for that interface
       instead of the numeric address.   However, in  many  cases
       there may be only one domain name for all of a router's IP
       addresses, and it would not be  appropriate  to  use  that
       name here.

       In  Figure  1  there is also a _g_r_o_u_p statement, which pro­
       vides common parameters for a set of three hosts -  zappo,
       beppo  and  harpo.  As you can see, these hosts are all in
       the test.isc.org domain, so it  might  make  sense  for  a
       group-specific  parameter to override the domain name sup­
       plied to these hosts:

            option domain-name "test.isc.org";

       Also, given the domain they're in, these are probably test
       machines.   If  we  wanted to test the DHCP leasing mecha­
       nism, we might set the lease timeout somewhat shorter than
       the default:

            max-lease-time 120;
            default-lease-time 120;

       You may have noticed that while some parameters start with
       the _o_p_t_i_o_n keyword, some  do  not.    Parameters  starting
       with the _o_p_t_i_o_n keyword correspond to actual DHCP options,
       while parameters that do not start with the option keyword
       either control the behaviour of the DHCP server (e.g., how
       long a lease dhcpd  will  give  out),  or  specify  client
       parameters that are not optional in the DHCP protocol (for
       example, server-name and filename).

       In Figure  1,  each  host  had  _h_o_s_t_-_s_p_e_c_i_f_i_c  _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r_s.
       These  could  include  such things as the _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e option,
       the name of a file to upload (the _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r_)  _a_n_d
       _t_h_e  _a_d_d_r_e_s_s  _o_f  _t_h_e _s_e_r_v_e_r _f_r_o_m _w_h_i_c_h _t_o _u_p_l_o_a_d _t_h_e _f_i_l_e
       _(_t_h_e _n_e_x_t_-_s_e_r_v_e_r parameter).   In general,  any  parameter
       can  appear anywhere that parameters are allowed, and will
       be applied according to the scope in which  the  parameter
       appears.

       Imagine  that  you  have a site with a lot of NCD X-Termi­
       nals.   These terminals come in a variety of  models,  and
       you  want to specify the boot files for each models.   One
       way to do this would be to have host declarations for each
       server and group them by model:

       group {
         filename "Xncd19r";
         next-server ncd-booter;

         host ncd1 { hardware ethernet 0:c0:c3:49:2b:57; }
         host ncd4 { hardware ethernet 0:c0:c3:80:fc:32; }
         host ncd8 { hardware ethernet 0:c0:c3:22:46:81; }



                                                                4





dhcpd.conf(5)                                       dhcpd.conf(5)


       }

       group {
         filename "Xncd19c";
         next-server ncd-booter;

         host ncd2 { hardware ethernet 0:c0:c3:88:2d:81; }
         host ncd3 { hardware ethernet 0:c0:c3:00:14:11; }
       }

       group {
         filename "XncdHMX";
         next-server ncd-booter;

         host ncd1 { hardware ethernet 0:c0:c3:11:90:23; }
         host ncd4 { hardware ethernet 0:c0:c3:91:a7:8; }
         host ncd8 { hardware ethernet 0:c0:c3:cc:a:8f; }
       }

AADDDDRREESSSS PPOOOOLLSS
       The  ppooooll  declaration  can  be  used to specify a pool of
       addresses that will be treated  differently  than  another
       pool  of  addresses,  even  on the same network segment or
       subnet.   For example, you may want to provide a large set
       of addresses that can be assigned to DHCP clients that are
       registered to your DHCP server, while providing a  smaller
       set  of  addresses,  possibly with short lease times, that
       are available for unknown clients.   If you have  a  fire­
       wall,  you  may  be able to arrange for addresses from one
       pool to be allowed access to the Internet, while addresses
       in  another pool are not, thus encouraging users to regis­
       ter their DHCP clients.   To do this, you would set  up  a
       pair of pool declarations:

       subnet 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
         option routers 10.0.0.254;

         # Unknown clients get this pool.
         pool {
           option domain-name-servers bogus.example.com;
           max-lease-time 300;
           range 10.0.0.200 10.0.0.253;
           allow unknown clients;
         }

         # Known clients get this pool.
         pool {
           option domain-name-servers ns1.example.com, ns2.example.com;
           max-lease-time 28800;
           range 10.0.0.5 10.0.0.199;
           deny unknown clients;
         }
       }




                                                                5





dhcpd.conf(5)                                       dhcpd.conf(5)


       It  is  also possible to set up entirely different subnets
       for known and unknown clients - address pools exist at the
       level  of  shared  networks, so address ranges within pool
       declarations can be on different subnets.

       As you can see in the preceding example,  pools  can  have
       permit lists that control which clients are allowed access
       to the pool and which aren't.  Each entry in a pool's per­
       mit  list  is  introduced  with the _a_l_l_o_w or _d_e_n_y keyword.
       If a pool has a permit list, then only those clients  that
       match specific entries on the permit list will be elegible
       to be assigned addresses from the pool.   If a pool has  a
       deny  list,  then only those clients that do not match any
       entries on the deny list will be elegible.    If both per­
       mit  and  deny  lists  exist for a pool, then only clients
       that match the permit list and do not match the deny  list
       will be allowed access.

       Address  allocation is actually only done when a client is
       in the INIT state and has sent a DHCPDISCOVER message.  If
       the client thinks it has a valid lease and sends a DHCPRE­
       QUEST to initiate or renew that lease, the server has only
       three  choices  -  it  can  ignore the DHCPREQUEST, send a
       DHCPNAK to tell  the  client  it  should  stop  using  the
       address, or send a DHCPACK, telling the client to go ahead
       and use the address for a while.  If the server finds  the
       address  the  client  is  requesting,  and that address is
       available to the client, the server will send  a  DHCPACK.
       If the address is no longer available, or the client isn't
       permitted to have it, the server will send a DHCPNAK.   If
       the server knows nothing about the, it will remain silent,
       unless the address is incorrect for the network segment to
       which  the  client  has  been  attached  and the server is
       authoritative for that network segment, in which case  the
       server  will  send  a  DHCPNAK even though it doesn't know
       about the address.

       When the DHCP server allocates a new address for a  client
       (remember,  this  only  happens  if  the client has sent a
       DHCPDISCOVER), it first looks to see if the client already
       has  a valid lease on an IP address, or if there is an old
       IP address the client had  before  that  hasn't  yet  been
       reassigned.   In  that  case,  the  server  will take that
       address and check it to see if the client is still permit­
       ted  to  use  it.  If the client is no longer permitted to
       use it, the lease is freed if the server  thought  it  was
       still  in  use  -  the  fact  that  the  client has sent a
       DHCPDISCOVER proves to the server that the  client  is  no
       longer using the lease.

       If no existing lease is found, or if the client is forbid­
       den to receive the existing lease, then  the  server  will
       look  in the list of address pools for the network segment



                                                                6

       use  and  that the client is permitted to have.   It looks

       larations  that  appear  outside  of pool declarations are
       grouped into a single pool with no permit list).   If  the
       permit list for the pool allows the client to be allocated
       an address from that pool, the pool is examined to see  if
       there is an address available.   If so, then the client is
       tentatively assigned that address.   Otherwise,  the  next
       pool  is  tested.    If no addresses are found that can be
       assigned to the client, no response is sent to the client.

       If  an  address  is  found that the client is permitted to
       have, and that has  never  been  assigned  to  any  client
       before,  the  address  is  immediately  allocated  to  the
       client.   If the address is available for  allocation  but
       has  been  previously  assigned to a different client, the
       server will keep looking in hopes of  finding  an  address
       that has never before been assigned to a client.

       Clients can be seperated into classes, and treated differ­
       ently depending on what class they are in.   This  sepera­
       tion  can  be done either with a conditional statement, or
       with a match statement within the class declaration.    It
       is  possible  to  specify  a  limit on the total number of
       clients within a particular class  or  subclass  that  may
       hold  leases  at  one  time, and it is possible to specify
       automatic subclassing based on the contents of the  client
       packet.

       To add clients to classes based on conditional evaluation,
       you would write an  conditional  statement  to  match  the
       clients  you  wanted  in  the  class,  and then put an aadddd
       statement in the conditional's list of statements:

       if substring (option dhcp-client-identifier, 0, 3) = "RAS" {
         add "ras-clients";
       }

       A nearly equivalent way to do this is  to  simply  specify
       the conditional expression as a matching expression in the
       class statement:

       class "ras-clients" {
         match if substring (option dhcp-client-identifier, 0, 3) = "RAS";
       }
       Note that whether you  use  matching  expressions  or  add
       statements  (or both) to classify clients, you must always
       write a class declaration for any class that you use.   If
       there  will  be  no match statement and no in-scope state­
       ments for a class, the declaration should look like this:
       class "ras-clients" {
       }



                                                                7

       Also, the aadddd statement adds the client to  the  class  as
       the  client's  scopes  are  being  evaluated  -  after any
       address assignment decision has been  made.    This  means
       that  a  client  that's  a member of a class due to an add
       statement will not be affected by pool permits related  to
       that  class  -  when the pool permit list is computed, the
       client will not yet be a member of the pool.   This is  an
       inconsistency  that  will  probably  be addressed in later
       versions of the DHCP server, but it important to be  aware
       of it at lease for the time being.

       In  addition  to  classes,  it is possible to declare sub­
       classes.   A subclass is a class with the same name  as  a
       regular  class,  but  with  a specific submatch expression
       which is hashed for quick matching.  This is essentially a
       speed hack - the main difference between five classes with
       match expressions and one class with  five  subclasses  is
       that  it  will  be  quicker to find the subclasses.   Sub­
       classes work as follows:

       class "allocation-class-1" {
         match pick-first-value (option dhcp-client-identifier, hardware);
       }

       class "allocation-class-2" {
         match pick-first-value (option dhcp-client-identifier, hardware);
       }

       subclass "allocation-class-1" 1:8:0:2b:4c:39:ad;
       subclass "allocation-class-2" 1:8:0:2b:a9:cc:e3;
       subclass "allocation-class-1" 1:0:0:c4:aa:29:44;

       subnet 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
         pool {
           allow members of "allocation-class-1";
           range 10.0.0.11 10.0.0.50;
         }
         pool {
           allow members of "allocation-class-2";
           range 10.0.0.51 10.0.0.100;
         }
       }

       The data following the class name in the subclass declara­
       tion  is  a  constant  value  to use in matching the match
       expression for the class.  When class  matching  is  done,
       the  server  will  evaluate  the match expression and then
       look the result up in the hash  table.    If  it  finds  a
       match, the client is considered a member of both the class
       and the subclass.

       Subclasses can be declared with or without scope.   In the
       above  example,  the  sole  purpose  of the subclass is to



                                                                8





dhcpd.conf(5)                                       dhcpd.conf(5)


       allow some clients access to one address pool, while other
       clients  are given access to the other pool, so these sub­
       classes are declared without scopes.   If part of the pur­
       pose  of  the  subclass were to define different parameter
       values for some clients, you might want  to  declare  some
       subclasses with scopes.

       In  the  above  example,  if  you had a single client that
       needed some configuration parameters, while  most  didn't,
       you  might  write  the  following subclass declaration for
       that client:

       subclass "allocation-class-2" 1:08:00:2b:a1:11:31 {
         option root-path "samsara:/var/diskless/alphapc";
         filename "/tftpboot/netbsd.alphapc-diskless";
       }

       In this example, we've used subclassing as a way  to  con­
       trol  address  allocation on a per-client basis.  However,
       it's also possible to use subclassing in ways that are not
       specific to clients - for example, to use the value of the
       vendor-class-identifier option to determine what values to
       send  in the vendor-encapsulated-options option.  An exam­
       ple of this is shown under the VENDOR ENCAPSULATED OPTIONS
       head later on in this document.

       You  may  specify  a  limit  to the number of clients in a
       class that can be assigned leases.   The  effect  of  this
       will  be  to make it difficult for a new client in a class
       to get an address.   Once a class with such  a  limit  has
       reached its limit, the only way a new client in that class
       can get a lease is for an existing  client  to  relinquish
       its  lease,  either  by letting it expire, or by sending a
       DHCPRELEASE packet.   Classes with lease limits are speci­
       fied as follows:

       class "limited-1" {
         lease limit 4;
       }

       This  will produce a class in which a maximum of four mem­
       bers may hold a lease at one time.

       It is possible to declare a _s_p_a_w_n_i_n_g  _c_l_a_s_s.   A  spawning
       class  is  a  class that automatically produces subclasses
       based on what the client sends.   The reason that spawning
       classes  were  created  was  to make it possible to create
       lease-limited classes on the fly.   The envisioned  appli­
       cation  is  a cable-modem environment where the ISP wishes
       to provide clients at a particular site with more than one
       IP address, but does not wish to provide such clients with
       their own subnet, nor give them an unlimited number of  IP



                                                                9

       addresses  from the network segment to which they are con­
       nected.

       Many cable modem head-end systems can be configured to add
       a  Relay  Agent  Information  option  to DHCP packets when
       relaying them to the DHCP server.    These  systems  typi­
       cally  add  a circuit ID or remote ID option that uniquely
       identifies the customer site.   To take advantage of this,
       you can write a class declaration as follows:

       class "customer" {
         spawn with option agent.circuit-id;
         lease limit 4;
       }

       Now  whenever a request comes in from a customer site, the
       circuit ID option will be checked against the class's hash
       table.    If  a subclass is found that matches the circuit
       ID, the client will be classified  in  that  subclass  and
       treated  accordingly.    If  no subclass is found matching
       the circuit ID, a new one will be created  and  logged  in
       the  ddhhccppdd..lleeaasseess  file, and the client will be classified
       in this new class.   Once the client has been  classified,
       it  will  be  treated according to the rules of the class,
       including, in this case, being  subject  to  the  per-site
       limit of four leases.

       The   use  of  the  subclass  spawning  mechanism  is  not
       restricted to relay agent options - this particular  exam­
       ple  is  given only because it is a fairly straightforward
       one.

       The DHCP server has the ability to dynamically update  the
       Domain  Name  System.  Within the configuration files, you
       can define how you want  the  Domain  Name  System  to  be
       updated.   These updates are RFC 2136 compliant so any DNS
       server supporting  RFC  2136  should  be  able  to  accept
       updates  from the DHCP server.   The DHCP server will only
       perform DNS updates if it has been built with DNS  updates
       enabled  as  described  in the README file that comes with
       the DHCP distribution.

       The Dynamic DNS update scheme implemented in this  version
       of the ISC DHCP server is an interim implementation, which
       does not implement any of the standard update methods that
       have  been  discussed  in  the  working  group, but rather
       implements some very basic, yet useful,  update  capabili­
       ties.

       There  are  three  parameters, which may vary according to
       the scope, that control how DDNS  updates  will  be  done.
       The first two are the _d_d_n_s_-_d_o_m_a_i_n_n_a_m_e and _d_d_n_s_-_r_e_v_-_d_o_m_a_i_n_­
       _n_a_m_e statements.   The _d_d_n_s_-_d_o_m_a_i_n_n_a_m_e parameter sets  the



                                                               10

       domain name that will be appended to the client's hostname
       to form a fully-qualified domain-name (FQDN).   For  exam­
       ple,  if  the  client's hostname is "hutson" and the _d_d_n_s_-
       _d_o_m_a_i_n_n_a_m_e is set to "sneedville.edu", then  the  client's
       FQDN will be "hutson.sneedville.edu".

       The  _d_d_n_s_-_r_e_v_-_d_o_m_a_i_n_n_a_m_e  parameter  sets  the domain name
       that will be appended to the client's reversed IP  address
       to  produce  a  name  for  use in the client's PTR record.
       Normally, you would set this to "in-addr.arpa",  but  this
       is not required.

       A  third  parameter,  _d_d_n_s_-_h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e can be used to specify
       the hostname that will be used as the  client's  hostname.
       If no ddns-hostname is specified in scope, then the server
       will use a host-name option sent by the client.    If  the
       client did not send a host-name option, then if there is a
       host declaration that applies to the client, the name from
       that  declaration will be used.  If none of these applies,
       the server will not have a hostname for  the  client,  and
       will not be able to do a DDNS update.

HHOOWW DDNNSS UUPPDDAATTEESS WWOORRKK
       The  client's  FQDN, derived as we have described, is used
       as the name on which an "A" record will be stored.   The A
       record  will  contain  the  IP address that the client was
       assigned in its lease.   If there is already an  A  record
       with  the same name in the DNS server, no update of either
       the A or PTR records will occur - this prevents  a  client
       from  claiming  that its hostname is the name of some net­
       work server.   For  example,  if  you  have  a  fileserver
       called  "fs.sneedville.edu",  and  the  client  claims its
       hostname is "fs", no DNS update  will  be  done  for  that
       client, and an error message will be logged.

       If  the  A record update succeeds, a PTR record update for
       the assigned IP address will be done, pointing  to  the  A
       record.    This  update is unconditional - it will be done
       even if another  PTR  record  of  the  same  name  exists.
       Since the IP address has been assigned to the DHCP server,
       this should be safe.

       Please  note  that  the  current  implementation   assumes
       clients  only  have a single network interface.   A client
       with  two  network  interfaces  will   see   unpredictable
       behaviour.    This  is considered a bug, and will be fixed
       in a later release.   It may be helpful to enable the _o_n_e_-
       _l_e_a_s_e_-_p_e_r_-_c_l_i_e_n_t  parameter so that roaming clients do not
       trigger this same behavior.

       The DHCP protocol normally involves a four-packet exchange
       -  first the client sends a DHCPDISCOVER message, then the
       server sends a DHCPOFFER, then the client sends a  DHCPRE­
       QUEST,  then  the server sends a DHCPACK.   In the current



                                                               11

       version of the server, the server will  do  a  DNS  update
       after  it  has received the DHCPREQUEST, and before it has
       sent the DHCPOFFER.   It only sends the DNS update  if  it
       has not sent one for the client's address before, in order
       to minimize the impact on the DHCP server.

       When the client's lease expires, the DHCP server (if it is
       operating  at  the  time,  or  when next it operates) will
       remove the  client's  A  and  PTR  records  from  the  DNS
       database.    If the client releases its lease by sending a
       DHCPRELEASE message, the server will likewise remove the A
       and PTR records.

       Support  for  TSIG  and DNSSEC is not yet available.  When
       you set your DNS server up to allow updates from the  DHCP
       server,  you  may  be exposing it to unauthorized updates.
       To avoid this, the best you can do right now is to use  IP
       address-based  packet  filtering  to  prevent unauthorized
       hosts from submitting update requests.

       The DNS server must be configured to allow updates for any
       zone  that the DHCP server will be updating.  For example,
       let us say that clients in the sneedville.edu domain  will
       be  assigned  addresses  on  the 10.10.17.0/24 subnet.  In
       that case, assuming you are using ISC BIND 8.2.1 or later,
       you  would need to have the following declarations in your
       /etc/named.conf file:

       zone "sneedville.edu" {
            type master;
            file "sneedville.edu.db";
            allow-update { localhost; };
       };

       zone "17.10.10.in-addr.arpa" {
            type master;
            file "10.10.17.db";
            allow-update { localhost; };
       };

       This assumes that your DHCP server and  your  name  server
       will  be  running  on  the same computer - the "localhost"
       name is taken in the DNS server as an  alias  for  all  of
       that  host's  IP  addresses, and updates from any of those
       addresses will be accepted.

       You may wish to enable logging of DNS transactions on your
       DNS server.  To do so, you might write a logging statement
       like the following:

       logging {
            channel update_debug {
                 file "/var/log/update-debug.log";



                                                               12

                 severity  debug 3;
                 print-category yes;
                 print-severity yes;
                 print-time     yes;
            };
            channel security_info    {
                 file "/var/log/named-auth.info";
                 severity  info;
                 print-category yes;
                 print-severity yes;
                 print-time     yes;
            };

            category update { update_debug; };
            category security { security_info; };
       };

       You   must   create   the   /var/log/named-auth.info   and
       /var/log/update-debug.log  files  before starting the name
       server.   For more information on  configuring  ISC  BIND,
       consult the documentation that accompanies it.

       There  are three kinds of events that can happen regarding
       a lease, and it is possible  to  declare  statements  that
       occur  when any of these events happen.   These events are
       the commit event, when the server has made a commitment of
       a  certain  lease to a client, the release event, when the
       client has released the server from  its  commitment,  and
       the expiry event, when the commitment expires.

       To  declare  a  set of statements to execute when an event
       happens, you must use the oonn statement,  followed  by  the
       name  of  the event, followed by a series of statements to
       execute  when  the  event  happens,  enclosed  in  braces.
       Events  are  used to implement dynamic DNS updates, so you
       should not define your own event handlers if you are using
       the built-in dynamic DNS update mechanism.

       The  _s_h_a_r_e_d_-_n_e_t_w_o_r_k  statement  is used to inform the DHCP
       server that some IP subnets actually share the same physi­
       cal  network.   Any  subnets in a shared network should be
       declared within a  _s_h_a_r_e_d_-_n_e_t_w_o_r_k  statement.   Parameters

       any subnet in a shared network has addresses available for
       dynamic  allocation,  those addresses are collected into a
       common pool  for  that  shared  network  and  assigned  to
       clients  as  needed.   There  is  no way to distinguish on
       which subnet of a shared network a client should boot.

       _N_a_m_e should be the name of the shared network.   This name
       is  used when printing debugging messages, so it should be
       descriptive for the shared network.   The  name  may  have
       the  syntax of a valid domain name (although it will never
       be used as  such),  or  it  may  be  any  arbitrary  name,
       enclosed in quotes.

       The  _s_u_b_n_e_t statement is used to provide dhcpd with enough
       information to tell whether or not an  IP  address  is  on
       that  subnet.   It may also be used to provide subnet-spe­
       cific parameters and to  specify  what  addresses  may  be
       dynamically  allocated  to clients booting on that subnet.
       Such addresses are specified using the _r_a_n_g_e  declaration.

       The  _s_u_b_n_e_t_-_n_u_m_b_e_r  should be an IP address or domain name
       which resolves to the subnet number of  the  subnet  being
       described.   The _n_e_t_m_a_s_k should be an IP address or domain
       name which resolves to the subnet mask of the subnet being
       described.   The subnet number, together with the netmask,
       are sufficient to determine whether any given  IP  address
       is on the specified subnet.

       Although  a netmask must be given with every subnet decla­
       ration, it is recommended that if there is any variance in
       subnet  masks at a site, a subnet-mask option statement be
       used in each subnet declaration to set the desired  subnet
       mask, since any subnet-mask option statement will override
       the subnet mask declared in the subnet statement.

       For any subnet on which addresses will be assigned dynami­
       cally,  there  must be at least one _r_a_n_g_e statement.   The
       range statement gives the lowest and highest IP  addresses
       in  a  range.   All IP addresses in the range should be in
       the subnet in which the _r_a_n_g_e statement is declared.   The
       _d_y_n_a_m_i_c_-_b_o_o_t_p  flag  may  be specified if addresses in the

       There must be at least one hhoosstt statement for every  BOOTP
       client  that is to be served.  hhoosstt statements may also be
       specified for DHCP clients, although this is not  required
       unless booting is only enabled for known hosts.

       If  it  is  desirable  to  be able to boot a DHCP or BOOTP
       client on more than one subnet with fixed addresses,  more
       than  one  address  may  be specified in the _f_i_x_e_d_-_a_d_d_r_e_s_s
       parameter, or more than one hhoosstt statement may  be  speci­
       fied.

       If  client-specific  boot  parameters must change based on
       the network to which the client is attached, then multiple
       hhoosstt statements should be used.

       If  a client is to be booted using a fixed address if it's
       possible, but should be allocated a dynamic address other­
       wise,  then  a  hhoosstt statement must be specified without a
       ffiixxeedd--aaddddrreessss clause.  _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e should be a name identify­
       ing  the  host.  If a _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e option is not specified for
       the host, _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e is used.

       _H_o_s_t declarations are matched  to  actual  DHCP  or  BOOTP
       clients  by  matching  the  dhcp-client-identifier  option
       specified in the _h_o_s_t declaration to the one  supplied  by
       the client, or, if the _h_o_s_t declaration or the client does
       not provide a dhcp-client-identifier option,  by  matching
       the _h_a_r_d_w_a_r_e parameter in the _h_o_s_t declaration to the net­
       work hardware address  supplied  by  the  client.    BOOTP
       clients  do not normally provide a _d_h_c_p_-_c_l_i_e_n_t_-_i_d_e_n_t_i_f_i_e_r,
       so the hardware address must be used for all clients  that
       may boot using the BOOTP protocol.

       The _a_l_l_o_w and _d_e_n_y statements can be used to  control  the
       response  of the DHCP server to various sorts of requests.
       The allow and deny keywords actually have different  mean­
       ings  depending  on the context.  In a pool context, these
       keywords can be used to set up access  lists  for  address
       allocation  pools.  In other contexts, the keywords simply
       control general server behaviour with respect  to  clients
       based  on  scope.   In a non-pool context, the _i_g_n_o_r_e key­
       word can be used in place of the _d_e_n_y keyword  to  prevent

       The  uunnkknnoowwnn--cclliieennttss flag is used to tell dhcpd whether or
       not to dynamically assign addresses  to  unknown  clients.
       Dynamic  address  assignment to unknown clients is aalllloowwed
       by default.

       The bboooottpp flag is used to tell dhcpd  whether  or  not  to

       The bboooottiinngg flag is used to tell dhcpd whether or  not  to
       respond to queries from a particular client.  This keyword
       only has meaning when it appears in  a  host  declaration.
       By  default, booting is aalllloowwed, but if it is disabled for
       a particular client, then that client will not be able  to
       get and address from the DHCP server.  TThhee _d_u_p_l_i_c_a_t_e_s kkeeyy­­

       Host declarations can match client messages based  on  the
       DHCP Client Identifer option or based on the client's net­
       work hardware type and MAC address.   If the  MAC  address
       is  used,  the host declaration will match any client with
       that MAC address -  even  clients  with  different  client
       identifiers.   This doesn't normally happen, but is possi­
       ble when one computer has more than one  operating  system
       installed  on  it  -  for  example,  Microsoft Windows and
       NetBSD or Linux.

       The dduupplliiccaatteess flag  tells  the  DHCP  server  that  if  a
       request  is  received  from  a client that matches the MAC
       address of a host declaration, any other  leases  matching
       that  MAC  address should be discarded by the server, even
       if the UID is not the same.   This is a violation  of  the
       DHCP  protocol, but can prevent clients whose client iden­
       tifiers change regularly from holding many leases  at  the
       same  time.   By  default,  duplicates  are  aalllloowwed.  TThhee

       The DHCPDECLINE message is used by DHCP clients  to  indi­
       cate  that  the lease the server has offered is not valid.
       When the server receives a DHCPDECLINE  for  a  particular
       address,  it normally abandons that address, assuming that
       some unauthorized system is using  it.   Unfortunately,  a
       malicious or buggy client can, using DHCPDECLINE messages,
       completely exhaust  the  DHCP  server's  allocation  pool.
       The server will reclaim these leases, but while the client
       is running through the pool, it may cause serious  thrash­
       ing  in the DNS, and it will also cause the DHCP server to
       forget old DHCP client address allocations.

       The ddeecclliinneess flag tells the DHCP server whether or not  to
       honor  DHCPDECLINE  messages.    If  it  is set to ddeennyy or
       iiggnnoorree in a particular scope, the  DHCP  server  will  not
       respond to DHCPDECLINE messages.

       The uses of the allow and deny keyword shown in the previ­
       ous section work pretty much  the  same  way  whether  the
       client  is sending a DHCPDISCOVER or a DHCPREQUEST message
       - an address will be allocated to the client  (either  the
       old  address  it's  requesting, or a new address) and then
       that address will be tested to see if it's okay to let the
       client have it.   If the client requested it, and it's not
       okay, the server will send a DHCPNAK message.   Otherwise,
       the  server will simply not respond to the client.   If it
       is okay to give the address to the client, the server will



                                                               17

       send a DHCPACK message.

       The primary motivation behind pool declarations is to have
       address allocation pools  whose  allocation  policies  are
       different.    A  client  may be denied access to one pool,
       but allowed access to another pool  on  the  same  network
       segment.    In  order for this to work, access control has
       to be done during address allocation,  not  after  address
       allocation is done.

       When  a  DHCPREQUEST message is processed, address alloca­
       tion simply consists of looking up the address the  client
       is  requesting  and seeing if it's still available for the
       client.  If it is, then the DHCP server  checks  both  the
       address  pool permit lists and the relevant in-scope allow
       and deny statements to see if it's okay to give the  lease
       to the client.  In the case of a DHCPDISCOVER message, the
       allocation process is done as described previously in  the
       ADDRESS ALLOCATION section.

       When  declaring permit lists for address allocation pools,
       the following syntaxes are recognized following the  allow
       or deny keyword:

       _S_e_c_o_n_d_s should be the minimum number of  seconds  since  a
       client began trying to acquire a new lease before the DHCP
       server will respond to its request.  The number of seconds
       is based on what the client reports, and the maximum value
       that the client can report is  255  seconds.    Generally,
       setting  this  to  one  will result in the DHCP server not
       responding to  the  client's  first  request,  but  always
       responding to its second request.

       This  can  be used to set up a secondary DHCP server which
       never offers an address to  a  client  until  the  primary
       server  has been given a chance to do so.   If the primary
       server is down, the client  will  bind  to  the  secondary
       server,  but  otherwise  clients should always bind to the
       primary.   Note that this does not, by  itself,  permit  a
       primary  server  and a secondary server to share a pool of
       dynamically-allocatable addresses.

       time for all leases assigned dynamically to BOOTP clients.
       Because BOOTP clients do not  have  any  way  of  renewing
       leases,  and don't know that their leases could expire, by
       default  dhcpd  assignes  infinite  leases  to  all  BOOTP
       clients.  However, it may make sense in some situations to
       set a cutoff date for all BOOTP leases - for example,  the
       end of a school term, or the time at night when a facility
       is closed and all machines are required to be powered off.

       W is the day of the week expressed as a number  from  zero

       the   length  of  leases  dynamically  assigned  to  BOOTP
       clients.   At some sites, it may  be  possible  to  assume
       that  a  lease  is  no longer in use if its holder has not
       used BOOTP or DHCP to get its  address  within  a  certain
       time period.   The period is specified in _l_e_n_g_t_h as a num­
       ber of seconds.   If a client reboots using  BOOTP  during
       the timeout period, the lease duration is reset to _l_e_n_g_t_h,
       so a BOOTP client that boots frequently enough will  never
       lose its lease.  Needless to say, this parameter should be
       adjusted with extreme caution.

       The  DHCP  server will normally assume that the configura­
       tion information about a  given  network  segment  is  not
       known  to be correct and is not authoritative.  This is so
       that if a naive user installs  a  DHCP  server  not  fully
       understanding how to configure it, it does not send spuri­
       ous  DHCPNAK  messages  to  clients  that  have   obtained
       addresses from a legitimate DHCP server on the network.

       Network   administrators  setting  up  authoritative  DHCP
       servers for their networks should always write  aauutthhoorriittaa­­
       ttiivvee;;  at  the top of their configuration file to indicate
       that the DHCP server _s_h_o_u_l_d send DHCPNAK messages to  mis­
       configured clients.   If this is not done, clients will be
       unable to get a correct IP address after changing  subnets
       until  their old lease has expired, which could take quite
       a long time.

       Usually, writing aauutthhoorriittaattiivvee;; at the top  level  of  the
       file  should be sufficient.   However, if a DHCP server is
       to be set up so that it is  aware  of  some  networks  for
       which  it  is authoritative and some networks for which it
       is not, it may be more appropriate to declare authority on
       a per-network-segment basis.

       Note that the most specific scope for which the concept of
       authority makes any sense is the physical network  segment
       -  either a shared-network statement or a subnet statement
       that is not contained within a  shared-network  statement.
       It is not meaningful to specify that the server is author­
       itative for some subnets within a shared network, but  not
       authoritative  for others, nor is it meaningful to specify
       that the server is authoritative for  some  host  declara­
       tions and not others.

       Some  BOOTP clients expect RFC1048-style responses, but do
       not follow RFC1048 when sending their requests.   You  can

       with each BOOTREQUEST that is logged.

       host declaration, and the DHCP server will respond with an
       RFC-1048-style  vendor  options  field.   This flag can be
       set in any scope, and will affect all clients  covered  by
       that scope.

       The  DHCP  and BOOTP protocols both require DHCP and BOOTP
       clients to set the broadcast bit in the flags field of the
       BOOTP  message header.  Unfortunately, some DHCP and BOOTP
       clients do not do this,  and  therefore  may  not  receive
       responses  from  the DHCP server.   The DHCP server can be
       made to always broadcast its responses to clients by  set­
       ting  this flag to 'on' for the relevant scope.   To avoid
       creating excess broadcast traffic on your network, we rec­
       ommend  that you restrict the use of this option to as few
       clients as possible.   For  example,  the  Microsoft  DHCP
       client is known not to have this problem, as are the Open­
       Transport and ISC DHCP clients.

       If this flag is enabled, whenever a client sends a DHCPRE­
       QUEST  for  a  particular lease, the server will automati­
       cally free any other leases the client holds.   This  pre­
       sumes  that  when  the  client sends a DHCPREQUEST, it has
       forgotten any lease not mentioned  in  the  DHCPREQUEST  -
       i.e.,  the  client has only a single network interface _a_n_d
       it does not remember leases it's holding  on  networks  to
       which  it  is  not  currently attached.   Neither of these
       assumptions are guaranteed or provable, so we urge caution
       in the use of this statement.

       in a given scope, then instead of sending the value speci­
       fied  in  the routers option (or sending no value at all),
       the IP address of the lease being assigned is sent to  the
       client.   This supposedly causes Win95 machines to ARP for
       all IP addresses, which can be helpful if your  router  is
       configured for proxy ARP.

       The  server-identifier statement can be used to define the
       value that is sent in the DHCP  Server  Identifier  option
       for  a  given  scope.    The value specified mmuusstt be an IP
       address for the DHCP server, and must be reachable by  all
       clients served by a particular scope.

       The  use  of the server-identifier statement is not recom­
       mended - the only reason to use it is  to  force  a  value
       other than the default value to be sent on occasions where
       the default value would be incorrect.   The default  value
       is  the first IP address associated with the physical net­
       work interface on which the request arrived.

       The usual case where the _s_e_r_v_e_r_-_i_d_e_n_t_i_f_i_e_r statement needs
       to  be sent is when a physical interface has more than one
       IP address, and the one being sent by default isn't appro­
       priate  for  some or all clients served by that interface.
       Another common case is when an alias is  defined  for  the
       purpose  of  having  a  consistent IP address for the DHCP
       server, and it is desired that the  clients  use  this  IP
       address when contacting the server.

       Supplying a value for the dhcp-server-identifier option is
       equivalent to using the server-identifier statement.
