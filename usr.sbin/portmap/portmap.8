.Sh NAME
.Nm portmap
.Nd
.Tn RPC
program number to
.Tn DARPA
port mapper
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dils
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a server that converts
.Tn RPC
program numbers into
.Tn DARPA
protocol port numbers.
It must be running in order to make
.Tn RPC
calls.
.Pp
When an
.Tn RPC
server is started, it will tell
.Nm
what port number it is listening to, and what
.Tn RPC
program numbers it is prepared to serve.
When a client wishes to make an
.Tn RPC
call to a given program number,
it will first contact
.Nm
on the server machine to determine
the port number where
.Tn RPC
packets should be sent.
.Pp
.Nm
must be started before any
.Tn RPC
servers are invoked.
.Pp
Normally
.Nm
forks and dissociates itself from the terminal
like any other daemon.
.Nm
then logs errors using
.Xr syslog 3 .
.Pp
.Nm
uses
.Xr libwrap
style access control (the 
.Pa /etc/hosts.allow
and
.Pa /etc/hosts.deny
files)
to control access to the portmapper itself and control forwarding
of requests.  This prevents clients from using
.Nm
to circumvent host-based services in individual services.
.Pp
Available options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
prevents
.Nm
from running as a daemon,
and causes errors and debugging information
to be printed to the standard error output.
.It Fl i
.Dq insecure
mode. Allows calls to PMAPPROC_SET and PMAPPROC_UNSET from any host. Normally
.Nm
accepts these requests only from the loopback interface for security reasons.
This change is necessary for programs that were compiled with earlier
versions of the rpc library and do not make those requests using the
loopback interface. 
.It Fl l
Turns on libwrap connection logging.
.It Fl s
causes
.Nm
to change to the user daemon as soon as possible.
This causes
.Nm
to use non-privileged ports for outgoing connections, preventing non-privileged
clients from using
.Nm
to connect to services from a privileged port.

.Sh BUGS
If
.Nm
crashes, all servers must be restarted.
