.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
will list the last login session of specified
.Ar users ,
or for all users by default.
Each line of output contains the user name, the tty from which the
session was conducted, any hostname, and the start time for the
session.
.Pp
If multiple
.Ar users
are given, the session information for each user is printed in
the order given on the command line.
Otherwise, information for all users is printed, sorted by uid.
.Pp
.Nm
differs from
.Xr last 1
in that it only prints information regarding the very last login session.
The last login database is never turned over or deleted in standard usage.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl F
Use fixed widths for all output fields.
.It Fl f Ar filename
Process input from
.Ar filename .
If the file ends with an
.Dq x ,
then it is assumed that it is a
.Xr lastlogx 5
file, else it is assumed to be a
.Xr lastlog 5
file.
.It Fl H Ar hostlen
Set the field width for host output to
.Ar hostlen
characters.
.It Fl L Ar linelen
Set the field width for line output to
.Ar linelen
characters.
.It Fl N Ar namelen

To look at the old database one can use:
.Pp
.Dl lastlogin -f /var/log/lastlog
