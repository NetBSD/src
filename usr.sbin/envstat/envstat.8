.Sh NAME
.Nm envstat
.Nd display environmental sensor readings
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl flr
.Op Fl i Ar interval
.Op Fl n Ar headrep
.Op Fl s Ar sensor1,sensor2,...
.Op Fl w Ar width
.Op Ar device
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
displays sensor readings from any device which supports the
.Xr envsys 4
API.
Readings are displayed in columns, one column per sensor.
Column widths as well as displayed sensors are fully customizable.
The column headers display the name (stored in the device driver) as
well as the units of each sensor.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl f
Display any temperature values in degrees Fahrenheit.
The default is to display temperature values in degrees Celsius.
.It Fl l
List the names of all supported sensors, one per line.
Use of this flag causes
.Nm
to ignore all other option flags.
.It Fl i
Repeat the display every
.Ar interval
seconds.
Note that some devices do not provide fresh values on demand.
See the individual device's manual page for meaningful values for
.Ar interval .
If not specified, or specified as 0,
.Nm
produces one line of values and exits.
.It Fl n
Display a new header every
.Ar headrep
lines.
An argument of 0 disables header line printing completely.
The default is every 22 lines.
.It Fl r
Display the sensors row wise.
This is useful when the number of sensors is large.
This option also displays fractional values when present
(e.g., the percentage battery charge).
.It Fl s
Restrict the display to the named sensors.
The sensor names must be supplied as a comma separated list.
Sensor names are case sensitive.
.It Fl w
Use
.Ar width
as the column width for the output.
Each column is additionally separated by a single space.
The default is either the length of the longest sensor
name or spread evenly to fill 80 columns, whichever is greater.
