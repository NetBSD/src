.Sh NAME
.Nm envstat
.Nd utility to handle environmental sensors
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl DfIlSTWx
.Op Fl c Ar file
.Op Fl d Ar device
.Op Fl i Ar interval
.Op Fl s Ar "device:sensor,..."
.Op Fl w Ar width
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a utility that handles various aspects of the sensors
registered with the
.Xr envsys 4
framework.
It is capable of displaying sensor values as well as
changing parameters and setting critical limits for the sensors.
.Pp
In display mode, column widths as well as displayed sensors
are fully customizable.
Critical limits or other properties can be set via the configuration file.
If critical limits were set previously, the display mode will show
the critical limits in addition to the current values.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl c
Accepts a file as argument to set properties for sensors in
devices registered with the framework.
See the
.Xr envsys.conf 5
manual page for more information.
.It Fl D
Display the names of the drivers that were registered with
the
.Xr envsys 4
framework, one per line and some properties for the driver: refresh timeout
value, for example.
.It Fl d Ar device
Display only the sensors for the given
.Ar device .
This is useful when there are multiple devices registered and
you want to only see results from a specific device.
.It Fl f
Display temperature values in degrees Fahrenheit.
The default is to display temperature values in degrees Celsius.
.It Fl I
This flag skips the sensors with invalid state, these are normally
shown using the
.Qq N/A
string by default.
.It Fl i Ar interval
Repeat the display every
.Ar interval
seconds.
Note that some devices do not provide fresh values on demand.
See the individual device's manual page for meaningful values for
.Ar interval .
If not specified, or specified as 0,
.Nm
produces one round of values and exits.
.It Fl k
Display temperature values in Kelvin.
The default is to display temperature values in degrees Celsius.
.It Fl l
List the names of all supported sensors, one per line.
Use of this flag causes
.Nm
to ignore all other option flags.
.It Fl r
This flag is provided for compatibility reasons and there's no need
to use it.
In the previous implementation, it was used to enable the
row mode; this mode is now the default.
.It Fl S
This flag is used to restore defaults to all devices registered with
the framework.
This will remove all properties that were set in
the configuration file to the setting that the drivers use by
default.
.It Fl s Ar "device:sensor,..."
Restrict the display to the named sensors.
The pair device and sensor description must be supplied as a comma separated list.
Device as well as sensor descriptions are case sensitive.
.It Fl T
Create and display max, min and average statistics for a sensor.
Must be used with an
.Ar interval ,
otherwise statistics cannot be collected up.
Please note that to get realistic
values a lower interval value should be used, but that will also increase
overhead.
.It Fl w Ar width
Use
.Ar width
as the column width for the output.
Each column is additionally separated by a single space.
The default is the length of the longest sensor name.
.It Fl W
This option has no effect.  It is retained for historical reasons.
.It Fl x
Shows the property list used by the
.Xr sysmon_envsys 9
framework that contains details about all registered drivers
and sensors.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To display the
.Dq charge
sensor of the driver
.Ar acpibat0
in one line every ten seconds:
.Pp
.Dl $ envstat -s \*qacpibat0:charge\*q -i 10
.Pp
To list the drivers that are currently registered with
.Xr envsys 4 :
.Pp
.Dl $ envstat -D
.Pp
To display the sensors of the driver
.Ar aiboost0 :
.Pp
.Dl $ envstat -d aiboost0
.Pp
To set all properties specified in the configuration file:
.Pp
.Dl $ envstat -c /etc/envsys.conf
.Pp
To remove all properties that were set previously in the configuration
file:
.Pp
.Dl $ envstat -S
.Pp
To display statistics for all sensors and ignoring sensors with
invalid states every second:
.Pp
.Dl $ envstat -ITi1
