.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg_delete
.Nd a utility for deleting previously installed software package distributions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl DdFfnORrVv
.Bk -words
.Op Fl K Ar pkg_dbdir
.Ek
.Bk -words
.Op Fl p Ar prefix
.Ek
.Ar pkg-name ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to delete packages that have been previously installed
with the
.Xr pkg_add 1
command.
.Sh WARNING
.Bf -emphasis
Since the
.Nm
command may execute scripts or programs provided by a package file,
your system may be susceptible to ``Trojan horses'' or other subtle
attacks from miscreants who create dangerous package files.
.Pp
You are advised to verify the competence and identity of those who
provide installable package files.
For extra protection, examine all the package control files in the
package record directory
.Pa ( /var/db/pkg/\*[Lt]pkg-name\*[Gt]/ ) .
Pay particular
attention to any +INSTALL, +DEINSTALL, +REQUIRE or +MTREE_DIRS files,
and inspect the +CONTENTS file for
.Cm @cwd ,
.Cm @mode
(check for setuid),
.Cm @dirrm ,
.Cm @exec ,
and
.Cm @unexec
directives, and/or use the
.Xr pkg_info 1
command to examine the installed package control files.
.Ef
.Sh OPTIONS
The following command line options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar pkg-name ...
The named packages are deinstalled, wildcards can be used, see
.Xr pkg_info 1 .
If no version is given, the one currently installed
will be removed.
If the
.Fl F
flag is given, one or more (absolute) filenames may be specified and
the Package Database will be consulted for the package to which the
given file belongs.
These packages are then deinstalled.
.It Fl D
If a deinstallation script exists for a given package, do not execute it.
.It Fl d
Remove empty directories created by file cleanup.
By default, only files/directories explicitly listed in a package's
contents (either as normal files/directories or with the
.Cm @dirrm
directive) will be removed at deinstallation time.
This option tells
.Nm
to also remove any directories that were emptied as a result of removing
the package.
.It Fl F
Any pkg-name given will be interpreted as pathname which is
subsequently transformed in a (real) package name via the Package
Database.
That way, packages can be deleted by giving a filename
instead of the package-name.
.It Fl f
Force removal of the package, even if a dependency is recorded or the
deinstall or require script fails.
.It Fl K Ar pkg_dbdir
Set
.Ar pkg_dbdir
as the package database directory.
If this option isn't specified, then the package database directory is
taken from the value of the environment variable
.Ev PKG_DBDIR
if it's set, otherwise it defaults to
.Pa /var/db/pkg .
.It Fl n
Don't actually deinstall a package, just report the steps that
would be taken if it were.
.It Fl O
Only delete the package's entries from the package database, do not
touch the package or its files itself.
.It Fl p Ar prefix
Set
.Ar prefix
as the directory in which to delete files from any installed packages
which do not explicitly set theirs.
For most packages, the prefix will
be set automatically to the installed location by
.Xr pkg_add 1 .
.It Fl R
Like the
.Fl r
option, this does a recursive delete.
The
.Fl R
option deletes the given package and any packages required by
it, unless some other package still needs them.
This can be used to delete a package and all the packages it needs.
.It Fl r
.Nm
first builds a list of all packages that require (directly and indirectly)
the one being deleted.
It then deletes these packages using
.Nm
with the given options before deleting the user specified package.
.It Fl V
Print version number and exit.
.It Fl v
Turn on verbose output.
.El
.Sh TECHNICAL DETAILS
.Nm
does pretty much what it says.
It examines installed package records in
.Pa /var/db/pkg/\*[Lt]pkg-name\*[Gt] ,
deletes the package contents, and finally removes the package records
(if an alternate package database directory is specified, then it
overrides the
.Pa /var/db/pkg
path shown above).
.Pp
If a package is required by other installed packages,
.Nm
will list those dependent packages and refuse to delete the package
(unless the
.Fl f
option is given).
.Pp
If a package has been marked as a
.Cm preserved
package, it will not be able to be deleted
(unless more than one occurrence of the
.Fl f
option is given).
.Pp
If a filename is given instead of a package name, the package of which
the given file belongs to can be deleted if the
.Fl F
Flag is given.
The filename needs to be absolute, see the output produced by the pkg_info
.Fl aF
command.
.Pp
If the package contains a
.Ar require
file (see
.Xr pkg_create 1 ) ,
then this is executed first as
.Bd -filled -offset indent -compact
.Cm require
.Ar \*[Lt]pkg-name\*[Gt]
.Ar DEINSTALL
.Ed
(where
.Ar pkg-name
is the name of the package in question and
.Ar DEINSTALL
is a keyword denoting that this is a deinstallation)
to see whether or not deinstallation should continue.
A non-zero exit status means no, unless the
.Fl f
option is specified.
.Pp
If a
.Cm deinstall
script exists for the package, it is executed before and after
any files are removed.
It is this script's responsibility to clean up any additional messy details
around the package's installation, since all
.Nm
knows how to do is delete the files created in the original distribution.
The
.Ic deinstall
script is called as:
.Bd -filled -offset indent -compact
.Cm deinstall
.Ar \*[Lt]pkg-name\*[Gt]
.Ar VIEW-DEINSTALL
.Ed
before removing the package from a view, and as:
.Bd -filled -offset indent -compact
.Cm deinstall
.Ar \*[Lt]pkg-name\*[Gt]
.Ar DEINSTALL
.Ed
before deleting all files and as:
.Bd -filled -offset indent -compact
.Cm deinstall
.Ar \*[Lt]pkg-name\*[Gt]
.Ar POST-DEINSTALL
.Ed
after deleting them.
Passing the keywords
.Ar VIEW-DEINSTALL ,
.Ar DEINSTALL
and
.Ar POST-DEINSTALL
lets you potentially write only one program/script that handles all
aspects of installation and deletion.
.Pp
All scripts are called with the environment variable
.Ev PKG_PREFIX
set to the installation prefix (see the
.Fl p
option above).
This allows a package author to write a script
that reliably performs some action on the directory where the package
is installed, even if the user might have changed it by specifying the
.Fl p
option when running
.Nm
or
.Xr pkg_add 1 .
