.Op Fl s Ar sfx_pattern
.Ek
.Ar command Op args ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This command performs various administrative tasks around the
.Nx
Packages System.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following command-line options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b
Print only the basenames when matching package names for
.Cm lsall
and
.Cm lsbest .
.It Fl d Ar lsdir
Set
.Ar lsdir
as the path to the directory in which to find matching package names for
.Cm lsall
and
.Cm lsbest .
.It Fl K Ar pkg_dbdir
Set
.Ar pkg_dbdir
as the package database directory.
If this option isn't specified, then the package database directory is
taken from the value of the environment variable
.Ev PKG_DBDIR
if it's set, otherwise it defaults to
.Pa /var/db/pkg .
.It Fl S
Set the shell glob pattern for package suffices when matching package
names for
.Cm lsall
and
.Cm lsbest
to be the null suffix.
The default pattern is ".t[bg]z".
.It Fl s Ar sfx_pattern
Set the shell glob pattern for package suffices when matching package
names for
.Cm lsall
and
.Cm lsbest .
The default pattern is ".t[bg]z".
.It Fl V
Print version number and exit.
.El
.Pp
The following commands are supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm add Ar pkg ...
For each listed package, write the absolute pathnames of the files listed in
its +CONTENTS file together with the package they belong to into the package
database.
This should be used only by
.Xr pkg_view 1 .
.It Cm check Op Ar pkg ...
Use this command to check the files belonging to some or all of the
packages installed on the local machine against their MD5 checksum
noted in their +CONTENTS files.
If no additional argument is given, the files of all installed packages
are checked, else only the named packages will be checked (wildcards can
be used here, see
.Xr pkg_info 1 ) .
.Pp
The packages' +CONTENTS files will be parsed and the MD5
checksum will be checked for every file found.
A warning message is printed if the expected checksum differs from the
checksum of the file on disk.
.It Cm delete Ar pkg ...
For each listed package, remove all file entries in the package database that
belong to the package.
This should be used only by
.Xr pkg_view 1 .
.It Cm dump
Dump the contents of the package database, similar to
.Cm pkg_info -F .
Columns are printed for the keyfield used in the pkgdb - the filename -,
and the data field - the package the file belongs to.
.It Cm lsall Ar /dir/pkgpattern
.It Cm lsbest Ar /dir/pkgpattern
List all/best package matching pattern in the given directory
.Pa /dir .
If the
.Fl d
flag is given, then that directory path overrides
.Pa /dir .
Can be used to work around limitations of /bin/sh and other
filename globbing mechanisms.
This option implements matching of
pkg-wildcards against arbitrary files and directories, useful mainly in
the build system itself.
See
.Xr pkg_info 1
for a description of the pattern.
.Pp
Example:
.Bd -literal
yui# cd /usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/
yui# ls unzip*
unzip-5.40.tgz  unzip-5.41.tgz
yui# pkg_admin lsall 'unzip*'
/usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/unzip-5.40.tgz
/usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/unzip-5.41.tgz
yui# pkg_admin lsall 'unzip\*[Ge]5.40'
/usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/unzip-5.40.tgz
/usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/unzip-5.41.tgz
yui# pkg_admin lsall 'unzip\*[Ge]5.41'
/usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/unzip-5.41.tgz
yui# pkg_admin lsbest 'unzip\*[Ge]5.40'
/usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/unzip-5.41.tgz
yui# pkg_admin lsall /usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/'{mit,unproven}-pthread*'
/usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/mit-pthreads-1.60b6.tgz
/usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/unproven-pthreads-0.15.tgz
.Ed
.It Cm pmatch Ar pattern Ar pkg
Returns true if
.Ar pkg
matches
.Ar pattern ,
otherwise returns false.
.It Cm rebuild
Rebuild the package database mapping from scratch, scanning
subdirectories in
.Pa /var/db/pkg
for
.Pa +CONTENTS
files, parsing them and writing the resulting absolute pathnames
together with the package they belong to into the package database.
.Pp
This option is intended to be used for upgrading from non-pkgdb-pkg_*
tools to pkgdb-pkg_* tools, further manipulation of the pkgdb will be
done by
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
.Xr pkg_delete 1 ,
and
.Xr pkg_create 1 .
.Pp
Needs to be run as root.
.Pp
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Ev PKG_DBDIR
If the
.Fl K
flag isn't given, then
.Ev PKG_DBDIR
is the location of the package database directory.
The default package database directory is
.Pa /var/db/pkg .
