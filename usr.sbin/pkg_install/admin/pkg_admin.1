.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg_admin
.Nd perform various administrative tasks to the pkg system. 
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ""
.Ar command args ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This command performs various administrative tasks around the NetBSD
Packages System. Available commands are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width check [pkg]
.It Cm rebuild
Rebuild the package database mapping from scratch, scanning
subdirectories in
.Pa /var/db/pkg
for
.Pa +CONTENTS
files, parsing them and writing the resulting absolute pathnames
together with the package they belong to into the package database.
.Pp
This option is intended to be used for upgrading from non-pkgdb-pkg_*
tools to pkgdb-pkg_* tools, further manipulation of the pkgdb will be
done by
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
.Xr pkg_delete 1
and
.Xr pkg_create 1 .
.Pp
Needs to be run as root.
.Pp
.It Cm check Ar [pkg ...]
Use this command to check the files belonging to some or all of the
packages installed on the local machine against their MD5 checksum
noted in their +CONTENTS files. If no additional argument is given,
the files of all installed packages are installed, else only the named
packages will be ckecked (wildcards can be used here, see
.Xr pkg_info 1
).
.Pp
The packages' +CONTENTS files will be parsed and the MD5
checksum will be checked for every file found. A warning message is
printed if the expected checksum differs from the checksum of the file
on disk.
.Pp
.It Cm dump
Dump the contents of the package database, similar to
.Cm pkg_info -F .
Columns are printed for the keyfield used in the pkgdb - the filename -,
and the data field - the package the file belongs to. 
.It Cm lsall /dir/pkgpattern
.It Cm lsbest /dir/pkgpattern
List all/best package matching pattern in the given directory.
Can be used to work around limitations of /bin/sh and other
filename globbing mechanisms. This option implemente matching of
pkg-wildcards against arbitrary files, useful mainly in the build
system itself. See
.Xr pkg_info 1
for a description of the pattern.

Example:
.Bd -literal
yui# cd /usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/
yui# ls unzip*
unzip-5.40.tgz  unzip-5.41.tgz
yui# pkg_admin lsall 'unzip*'
unzip-5.40.tgz
unzip-5.41.tgz
yui# pkg_admin lsall 'unzip>=5.40'
unzip-5.40.tgz
unzip-5.41.tgz
yui# pkg_admin lsall 'unzip>=5.41'
unzip-5.41.tgz
yui# pkg_admin lsbest 'unzip>=5.40'
unzip-5.41.tgz
yui# pkg_admin lsall /usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/'{mit,unproven}-pthread*'
/usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/mit-pthreads-1.60b6.tgz
/usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/unproven-pthreads-0.15.tgz
