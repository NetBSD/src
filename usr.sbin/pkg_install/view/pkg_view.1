.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg_view
.Nd a utility for managing package views
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar options
.Ar command
.Ar package ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to add and delete packages in
.Ar stowdir
into a
.Ar view
in the
.Ar viewbase
directory.
.Sh WARNING
.Bf -emphasis
Since the
.Nm
command may execute scripts or programs contained within a package file,
your system may be susceptible to ``Trojan horses'' or other subtle
attacks from miscreants who create dangerous package files.
.Pp
You are advised to verify the competence and identity of those who
provide installable package files.
For extra protection, use the
.Fl M
flag to extract the package file, and inspect its contents and scripts
to ensure it poses no danger to your system's integrity.
Pay particular attention to any +INSTALL, +DEINSTALL, +REQUIRE
or +MTREE_DIRS files, and inspect the +CONTENTS file for
.Cm @cwd ,
.Cm @mode
(check for setuid),
.Cm @dirrm ,
.Cm @exec ,
and
.Cm @unexec
directives, and/or use the
.Xr pkg_info 1
command to examine the package file.
.Ef
.Sh OPTIONS
The following command-line options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d Ar stowdir
Set
.Ar stowdir
as the directory in which the installed packages can be found.
The default
.Ar stowdir
is the
.Pa packages
directory under
.Ar viewbase .
.It Fl i Ar ignore
Add
.Ar ignore
to the list of files in
.Ar package
that should ignored when adding or removing the package from
.Ar view .
.It Fl V
Print the version number and exit.
.It Fl v
Turn on verbose output.
.It Fl W Ar viewbase
Set
.Ar viewbase
as the directory in which all the views are managed.
The default
.Ar viewbase
directory is
.Pa /usr/pkg
but may be overridden by the
.Ev PKG_VIEWBASE
environment variable.
.It Fl w Ar view
Set
.Ar view
as the directory in
.Ar viewbase
in which the packages should be added or removed.
The default
.Ar view
is the empty view but may be overridden by the
.Ev PKG_VIEW
environment variable.
.El

The following commands are supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent

.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ev PKG_DBDIR_DFLT
The package database directory for the default view,
.Pa /var/db/pkg ,
can be overridden by specifying an alternative directory in the
.Ev PKG_DBDIR_DFLT
environment variable.
.It Ev PLIST_IGNORE_FILES
This can be used to specify files in
.Ar package
that should ignored when adding or removing the package from
.Ar view .
.Ev PLIST_IGNORE_FILES
is a space-separated list of shell glob patterns that match files relative
to the
.Ar package
directory, and it defaults to "info/dir *[~#] *.OLD *.orig *,v".
.It Ev PKG_VIEW
The default view can be specified in the
.Ev PKG_VIEW
environment variable.
.It Ev PKG_VIEWBASE
The standard viewbase directory,
.Pa /usr/pkg ,
can be overridden by specifying an alternative directory in the
.Ev PKG_VIEWBASE
environment variable.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Pa <pkg-dbdir>/<package>/+INSTALL
If the package contains an
.Ar install
script (see
.Xr pkg_create 1 ) ,
then after the package is added into a view, the script is executed
with the following arguments:
.Bl -tag -width package
.It Ar package
The name of the package being installed.
.It Cm VIEW-INSTALL
Keyword denoting that the script is to perform any actions needed after
the package is added to a view.
.El

.It Pa <pkg-dbdir>/<package>/+DEINSTALL

then before the package is removed from a view, the script is executed
with the following arguments:
.Bl -tag -width package
.It Ar package
The name of the package being installed.
.It Cm VIEW-DEINSTALL
