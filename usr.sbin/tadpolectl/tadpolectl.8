.Sh NAME
.Nm tadpolectl
.Nd get or set tadpole microcontroller state
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm tadpolectl
.Op Fl n
.Ar name ...
.Nm tadpolectl
.Op Fl n
.Fl w
.Ar name=value ...
.Nm tadpolectl
.Op Fl n
.Fl a
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm tadpolectl
utility retrieves values from the ts102 microcontroller
 and allows processes with appropriate privilege to set some values.
The state to be retrieved or set is described using a
``Management Information Base'' (``MIB'') style name,
described as a dotted set of components.
The
.Fl a
flag can be used to list all the currently available string or integer values.
.Pp
The
.Fl n
flag specifies that the printing of the field name should be
suppressed and that only its value should be output.
This flag is useful for setting shell variables.
For example, to save the pagesize in variable psize, use:
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
set psize=`tadpolectl -n hw.power.mains`
.Ed
.Pp
If just a MIB style name is given,
the corresponding value is retrieved.
If a value is to be set, the
.Fl w
flag must be specified and the MIB name followed
by an equal sign and the new value to be used.
.Pp
The information available from
.Nm tadpolectl
consists of only integers.  Some registers can be modified, but have no
way of reading what the current value is.  Those registers will allways
display
.Dq 0 .
.Pp
The changeable column indicates whether a process with appropriate
privilege can change the value, and if a displayed value is valid.

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pp
For example, to retrieve the current internal battery charge level
, one would use the following request:
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
tadpolectl hw.power.battery.int.chargelevel
.Ed
.Pp
To set the speaker beep frequency of
the system to 1000, one would use the following request:
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
tadpolectl -w hw.speaker.freq=1000
