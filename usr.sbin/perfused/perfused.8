.Sh NAME
.Nm perfused
.Nd "PUFFS Enabled Relay to FUSE Daemon"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl f
.Op Fl d Ar types
.Op Fl s
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a userland daemon mplementing the FUSE kernel level API. It creates a
.Pa /dev/fuse
socket for FUSE filesystem daemons to conenct to.
.Nm
takes care of mouting the filesystem using 
.Xr puffs 3 .
.Pp
When the kernel sends a 
.Xr puffs 3
operation for the mounted filesystem, 
.Nm
will translate it into a FUSE request, and will send it to the filesystem
daemon through
.Pa /dev/fuse .
The FUSE reply will be converted back into a 
.Xr puffs 3
reply and will be relayed to the kernel.
.Pp
FUSE filesystems daemons must be modified so that they request
.Nm
for performing the 
.Xr mount 2
system call instead of doing it on their own. This is done by 
replacing in the sources
.Xr mount 2
and the
.Xr open 2 
call for
.Pa /dev/fuse
by
.Fn perfuse_mount
and 
.Fn perfuse_open .
.Xr libperfuse 3
must be used at link time.
Most FUSE filesystem daemons use
.Nm libfuse
and will work unmodified, provided 
the modification is done in 
.Nm libfuse
itself .
.Pp
The following options are availlable:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl f
Do not fork and stay in the foreground.
.It Fl d Ar types
Print additionnal debug information. 
.Ar types
is a comma-separated list of informaton type to print: 
.Bl -tag -width indent
