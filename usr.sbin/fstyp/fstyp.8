.Sh NAME
.Nm fstyp
.Nd determine filesystem type
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl l
.Op Fl s
.Op Fl u
.Ar special
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to determine the filesystem type on a given device.
It can recognize ISO-9660, Ext2, FAT, NTFS, and UFS filesystems.
When the
.Fl u
flag is specified,
.Nm
also recognizes certain additional metadata formats that cannot be
handled using
.Xr mount 8 ,
such as
ZFS pools.
.Pp
The filesystem name is printed to the standard output
as, respectively:
.Bl -item -offset indent -compact
.It
cd9660
.It
ext2fs
.It
msdosfs
.It
ntfs
.It
ufs
.It
zfs
.El
.Pp
Because
.Nm
is built specifically to detect filesystem types, it differs from
.Xr file 1
in several ways.
The output is machine-parsable, filesystem labels are supported,
and does not try to recognize any file format other than filesystems.
.Pp
These options are available:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl l"
.It Fl l
In addition to filesystem type, print filesystem label if available.
.It Fl s
Ignore file type.
By default,
.Nm
only works on regular files and disk-like device nodes.
Trying to read other file types might have unexpected consequences or hang
indefinitely.
.It Fl u
Include filesystems and devices that cannot be mounted directly by
.Xr mount 8 .
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs or the filesystem
type is not recognized.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr file 1 ,
.Xr autofs 5 ,
.Xr mount 8 ,
