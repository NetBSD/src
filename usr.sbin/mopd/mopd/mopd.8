.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
services
.Tn DEC
Maintenance Operations Protocol
.Pq Tn MOP
Load requests on the Ethernet connected to
.Ar interface
or all interfaces if
.Fl a
option is given.
.Pp
In a load request received by
.Nm
a filename can be given by the client.
This is the normal case for terminal servers.
If a filename isn't in the client load request
.Nm
must know what image to load.
.Pp
Upon receiving a request,
.Nm
checks if the requested file exists in
.Pa /tftpboot/mop
(unless the
.Fl s
option is given, see below) the filename is normally uppercase and with an
extension of
.Pa .SYS .
If the filename isn't given, the ethernet address of the target is used as
filename, e.g.
.Pa 08002b09f4de.SYS
and it might be a soft link to another file.
.Pp
.Nm
supports two kinds of files.
The first type that is check is if the file is in
.Xr a.out 5
format.
If not, a couple of Digital's formats are checked.
.Pp
In normal operation,
.Nm
forks a copy of itself and runs in the background.
Anomalies and errors are reported via
.Xr syslog 3 .
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Listen on all the Ethernets attached to the system.
If
.Fl a

The process will run in the foreground.
.It Fl f

to the filename provided by the client.
The typical client sends the requested file name in upper case.
