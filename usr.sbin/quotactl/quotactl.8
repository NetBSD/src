.Sh NAME
.Nm quotactl
.Nd send commands to the kernel disk quota subsystem
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl D
.Op Fl x
.Ar filesystem 
.Op Ar plist
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads a property list of commands from the specified file or stdin,
and sends it to the kernel for the specified filesystem through the
.Xr quotactl 2
system call.
.Pp
Available options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl x
Do not parse reply from kernel for errors and print it to stdout
.It Fl D
Debug: print plist sent to and received from kernel to stderr
.El
.Pp
If
.Fl x
is not specified, 
.Nm
parses the reply from the kernel, looking at each command return value
and reporting errors.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
exists with 0 on success. If there was problems parsing the command plist,
or the reply from the kernel, or if the
.Xr quotactl 2
system call returned an error, the exist status will be 1.
Unless
.Fl x
is present, a message is printed to stderr for each failed command,
and the exit status will be 2 if any comand failed.
.Sh EXAMPLES
This will set the quota limits for user id 100 on the filesystem /home:
.Bd -literal
quotactl /home << EOF
