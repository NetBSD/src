 * HISTORY
 * Revision 1.4  92/08/11  12:07:32  mrt
 * 	Added copyright.
 * 	[92/08/10            mrt]
 *
 * 21-Dec-87  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Changed to no longer use a name server.
 *
 * 26-May-87  Doug Philips (dwp) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Changed getnams and added several new routines to change the
 *	way that sup finds nameservers.  It now builds a tree of
 *	servers to check.  It walks over the tree.  At each node, it
 *	tries to contact the name server and get as many names
 *	resolved as it can.  It stops after either all collections
 *	have host names, or if some collections don't have host names
 *	but either everyone doesn't know what they are, or after too
 *	many tries, none could be reached.
 *
 * 25-May-87  Doug Philips (dwp) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Split off from sup.c
