.Sh NAME
.Nm bthcid
.Nd Bluetooth Link Key/PIN Code Manager
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl fn
.Op Fl d Ar device
.Op Fl m Ar mode
.Op Fl s Ar socket_name
.Nm
.Op Fl h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon handles Link Key and PIN code requests for Bluetooth devices.
It opens a raw HCI socket and listens for the following HCI events.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width "Link_Key_NotificationXXX"
.It Dv Link_Key_Request
.Nm
scans the
.Pa /var/db/bthcid.keys
file for a cached link key matching the remote device BD_ADDR and, if
found, the
.Dv Link_Key_Request_Reply
will be sent back to the device, otherwise the
.Dv Link_Key_Request_Negative_Reply
will be sent.
.Pp
.It Dv Link_Key_Notification
When a new link key is created by the device, it will be cached for future
use in the
.Pa /var/db/bthcid.keys
link keys file, which will be created if it does not already exist.
.Pp
.It Dv PIN_Code_Request
The
.Nm
daemon checks its PIN cache for a matching remote device entry.
If no PIN is found, the
.Nm
daemon will send a message to any PIN clients that have
registered, with the device details and a timeout value.
When no clients are available or the timeout has expired,
.Nm
will send a
.Dv PIN_Code_Request_Negative_Reply
back to the device.
When a PIN is found, or if a client responds within the timeout period, a
.Dv PIN_Code_Request_Reply
will be sent back to the device.
.Pp
PINs received from clients will be cached for 5 minutes until used, and may be added
to the cache prior to pairing with the
.Xr btpin 1
utility.
.El
.Pp
Some of the functionality of
.Nm
can be handled by the Bluetooth controller directly, and cached Link
Keys may be examined, deleted or moved to device storage using the
.Xr btkey 1
program.
.Pp
The command line options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl s Ar socket_name"
.It Fl d Ar device
Specify the local Bluetooth device address.
The default is BDADDR_ANY.
.It Fl f
Run in foreground (do not detach).
.It Fl h
Display usage message and exit.
.It Fl m
Specify the file mode access bits for the PIN client socket.
The default is to allow readwrite access to user and group (0660).
.It Fl n
Do not listen for PIN clients.
.It Fl s Ar socket_name
Specify the socket name to listen on for PIN clients.
The default path is
.Pa /var/run/bthcid .

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
daemon first appeared in
.Fx 5.3
as
.Ic hcsecd .
It was ported to
.Nx 4.0
with its present name and extended to support PIN clients by
.An Iain Hibbert
under the sponsorship of Itronix, Inc.
