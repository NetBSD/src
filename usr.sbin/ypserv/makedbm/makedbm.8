.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the utility in
.Tn YP
that creates the
.Xr db 3
database file containing the
.Tn YP
map.
.Pp
.Ar infile
is the pathname of the source file (where
.Dq -
is standard input).
Each line consists of the key and the value, with a space separating
the items.
Blank lines are ignored, and a
.Dq #
is a comment character and indicates that the rest of the line should
be ignored.
.Pp
.Ar outfile
is the pathname of the generated database.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b
Interdomain. Include an entry in the database informing a

effect on the maps
.Pa hosts.byname
and
.Pa hosts.byaddr .
.It Fl l
Lowercase. Convert all keys to lower case before adding them to the
.Tn YP
database.
.It Fl s
Secure map. Include an entry in the database informing
.Xr ypxfr 8
and
.Xr ypserv 8
that the
.Tn YP
map is going to be handled as secure (i.e., not served
to clients that don't connect from a reserved port).
.It Fl d Ar yp_domain_name
Include an entry in the map with
.Sq YP_DOMAIN_NAME
as the key and
.Ar yp_domain_name
as the value.

Include an entry in the map with
.Sq YP_INPUT_FILE
as the key and
.Ar yp_input_file
as the value.

Include an entry in the map with
.Sq YP_MASTER_NAME
as the key and
.Ar yp_master_name
as the value.
.It Fl o Ar yp_output_file
Include an entry in the map with
.Sq YP_OUTPUT_FILE
as the key and
.Ar yp_output_file
as the value.
.It Fl u Ar dbfile
Dump the contents of
.Ar dbfile
to standard output, in a format suitable to be passed back into
.Nm "" .
.Ar dbfile
is the pathname to the database.
