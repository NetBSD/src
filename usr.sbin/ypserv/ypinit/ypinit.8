.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
initializes the files and directories that are required for a
.Tn NIS

.Ar domainname
isn't specified, the default domain (as returned by
.Xr domainname 1 )
is used.

The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c
Create a
.Tn NIS
client.
Initializes
.Pa /var/yp/binding/\*[Lt]domain\*[Gt].ypservers
to contain a list of ypservers for
.Xr ypbind 8
to connect to.
.It Fl l Ar server1,...,serverN
Set the list of client servers from the command line rather than
prompting for them interactively.  The format is a comma separated list
of server names with no spaces.
.It Fl m
Create a master
.Tn NIS
server.
Generates map data from local files
.Pa ( /etc/master.passwd ,
.Pa /etc/group ,
etc.).
.It Fl s Ar master_server
Create a slave server.
Downloads the maps from
.Ar master_server ,
which should be the active master
.Tn NIS
server.
.El
.Pp
To rebuild or refresh the maps for the
.Tn NIS
domain \*[Lt]domain\*[Gt], change to the
.Pa /var/yp/\*[Lt]domain\*[Gt]
directory and run
.Ic make .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/yp/ypserv.log -compact
.It Pa /var/yp
master
.Tn NIS
directory; contains the template makefiles.
.It Pa /var/yp/\*[Lt]domain\*[Gt]
directory to store
.Tn NIS
maps for \*[Lt]domain\*[Gt].
.It Pa /var/yp/binding/\*[Lt]domain\*[Gt].ypservers
list of
.Tn NIS
