.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_psshfs
.Nd sshfs implementation for puffs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar options
.Ar user@host[:path]
.Ar mount_point
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility can be used to mount a file system using the ssh sftp
subprotocol, making a remote directory hierarchy appear in the
local directory tree.
This functionality is commonly known as
.Em sshfs .
.Pp
The mandatory parameters are the target host name and local mount
point.
The target host parameter can optionally contain a username whose
credentials will be used by the remote sshd, and a relative or
absolute path for the remote mountpoint's root.
If no user is given, the credentials of the user issuing the mount
command are used.
If no path is given, the user's home directory on the remote machine
will be used.
.Pp
The following command line options are available:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxx
.It Fl e
Makes the mounted file system nfs exportable.
If this option is used, it is very important to understand that
.Nm
can not provide complete support for nfs due to the limitations in
the backend.
Files are valid only for the time that
.Nm
is running and in the event of e.g. a server crash, all client retries
to access files will fail.
.It Fl o Ar [no]option
This flag can be used to give standard mount options and options
to puffs.
The most notable of these is
.Fl o Ar nocache ,
which disables the name cache and page cache for the file system.
It slows operations down, but will behave better when multiple
entities are accessing the same directory tree via various routes.
.It Fl p Ar sshport
Make ssh connection to port
.Ar sshport .
.It Fl s
This flag can be used to make the program stay on top.
The default is to detach from the terminal and run in the background.

.Xr mount 8 ,
.Xr sshd 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Nx 5.0 .
.Sh CAVEATS
Permissions are not handled.
Do not expect the file system to behave except for a single user.
.Pp
The implementation does not currently behave if the file system is
being accessed from other locations besides through the mounting
host.
Mount the file system without caching if the usage pattern is going
to be such.
