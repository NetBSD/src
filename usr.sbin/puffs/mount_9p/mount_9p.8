The

.Ar user
and whatever UID the user happens to have on the remote server.
If
.Ar path
is supplied, it is used as the mount rootpath on the remote host.
.Ar path
must be an absolute path.
.Pp
The
.Fl c
opiton enables to mount a file system exported by a VM host through
a character device file
.Ar devfile
backed by the
.Xr vio9p 4
driver.
See
.Xr vio9p 4
for more information.

By default
.Nm
runs in the background with
