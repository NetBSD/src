.Ar mount_point
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program is used to mount a file hierarchy served with the Plan 9
resource sharing protocol 9P.
After the file system is mounted, the files on the remote
.Ar host
will be accessed using the credentials of the user named
.Ar user
and whatever UID the user happens to have on the remote server.
If
.Ar path
is supplied, it is used as the mount rootpath on the remote host.
.Ar path
must be an absolute path.
.Pp
The host name may be optionally enclosed in square brackets.
This is required when using numeric IPv6 addresses as they contain
colons as part of their syntax.
.Pp
The
.Fl c
option enables to mount a file system exported by a VM host through
a character device file
.Ar device
backed by the
.Xr vio9p 4
driver.
See
.Xr vio9p 4
for more information.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width "Fl o Ar options"
.It Fl 4
Forces
.Nm
to use IPv4 addresses only.
.It Fl 6
Forces
.Nm
to use IPv6 addresses only.
.It Fl C
Permit the kernel to cache pathname components.
By default every time the kernel does a lookup for a component name,
the file server will be consulted.
.It Fl c
Interpret
.Ar special
as a device name.
See
.Xr vio9p 4 .
.It Fl o Ar options
Mount options.
See documentation for the
.Fl o
option to
.Xr mount 8 .
.It Fl p Ar port
Use the specified TCP port.
By default
.Nm
uses port 564
.Li ( 9pfs ) .
Another useful port is 6666
.Li ( styx ) ,
used by Inferno operating system.
.It Fl s
Run in the foreground.
Useful for debugging.
.It Fl u
Use 9P2000.u protocol that includes extensions to better support Unix
environments.
