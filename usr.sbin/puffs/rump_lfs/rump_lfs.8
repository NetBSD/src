.Sh NAME
.Nm rump_lfs
.Nd mount the lfs file system using a userspace server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "file-system PUFFS"
.Pp
.Nm
.Op options
.Ar special
.Ar node
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility can be used to mount lfs file systems.
It uses
.Xr rump 3
and
.Xr p2k 3
to facilitate running the file system as a server in userspace.
As opposed to
.Xr mount_lfs 8 ,
.Nm
does not use file system code within the kernel and therefore does
not require kernel support except
.Xr puffs 4 .
Apart from a minor speed penalty (~10%), there is no difference to
using the in-kernel code.
.Pp
It is recommended that untrusted file system images be mounted with
.Nm
instead of
.Xr mount_lfs 8 .
Corrupt file system images commonly cause the file system
to crash the entire kernel, but with
.Nm
only the userspace server process will dump core.
.Pp
Please see
.Xr mount_lfs 8
for a full description of the available command line options.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr p2k 3 ,
.Xr puffs 3 ,
.Xr rump 3 ,
.Xr mount_lfs 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Nx 5.0 .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
cannot be used via
.Xr mount 8 .
Instead,
.Nm
must be run directly.
