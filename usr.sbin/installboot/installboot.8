.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility installs and removes
.Nx
disk bootstrap software into a file system.
.Nm
can install
.Ar primary
into
.Ar filesystem ,
or disable an existing bootstrap in
.Ar filesystem .
.Pp
Generally,
.Nx
disk bootstrap software consists of two parts: a
.Dq primary
bootstrap program usually written into the disklabel area of the
file system by
.Nm ,
and a
.Dq secondary
bootstrap program that usually resides as an ordinary file in the file system.
.Pp
When booting, the primary bootstrap program is loaded and invoked by
the machine's PROM or BIOS.
After receiving control of the system it loads and runs the secondary
bootstrap program, which in turn loads and runs the kernel.
The secondary bootstrap may allow control over various boot parameters
passed to the kernel.
.Pp
Some platform
.Pq Fl m Ar machine
and file system type
.Pq Fl t Ar fstype
combinations require that the name of the secondary bootstrap is
supplied as
.Ar secondary ,
so that information such as the disk block numbers occupied
by the secondary bootstrap can be stored in the primary bootstrap.
These are:
.Bl -column "Platform" "File systems" -offset indent
.It Sy "Platform" Ta Sy "File systems"
.It macppc Ta ffs, raw
.It news68k Ta ffs, raw
.It newsmips Ta ffs, raw
.It sparc Ta ffs, raw
.It sun2 Ta ffs, raw
.It sun3 Ta ffs, raw
.El
.Pp
Perform the following steps to make a file system bootable:
.Bl -enum
.It
Copy the secondary bootstrap (usually
.Pa /usr/mdec/boot. Ns Sy MACHINE
or
.Pa /usr/mdec/boot )
to the root directory of the target file system.
.Pp
.
.It
Use
.Nm
to install the primary bootstrap program
(usually
.Pa /usr/mdec/bootxx_ Ns Sy FSTYPE )
into
.Ar filesystem .
.Pp
The following platforms do not require this step if the primary bootstrap
already exists and the secondary bootstrap file is just being updated:
.Sy alpha ,
.Sy amiga ,
.Sy pmax ,
.Sy sparc64 ,
and
.Sy vax .
.Pp
.El
.Pp
The options recognized by
.Nm
are as follows:
.
.Bl -tag -width "optionsxxx"
.
.It Fl b Ar s1bno
Install
.Ar primary
at block number
.Ar s1bno
instead of the default location for the machine and file system type.
.Sy [ alpha ,
.Sy pmax ,
.Sy vax ]
.
.It Fl B Ar s2bno
When hard-coding the blocks of
.Ar secondary
into
.Ar primary ,
start from block
.Ar s2bno
instead of trying to determine the block numbers occupied by
.Ar secondary
by examining
.Ar filesystem .
If this option is supplied,
.Ar secondary
should refer to an actual secondary bootstrap (rather than the
file name of the one present in
.Ar filesystem )
so that its size can be determined.
.
.It Fl c
Clear (remove) any existing bootstrap instead of installing one.
.
.It Fl m Ar machine
Use
.Ar machine
as the target machine type.
The default machine is determined from
.Xr uname 3
and then
.Ev MACHINE .
The following machines are currently supported by
.Nm :
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Sy alpha ,
.Sy amiga ,
.Sy macppc ,
.Sy news68k ,
.Sy newsmips ,
.Sy pmax ,
.Sy sparc ,
.Sy sparc64 ,
.Sy sun2 ,
.Sy sun3 ,
.Sy vax ,
.Sy x68k
.Ed
.
.
.It Fl n
Do not write to
.Ar filesystem .
.
.It Fl o Ar options
Machine specific
.Nm
options, comma separated.
.Pp
Supported options are (with the machines for they are valid in brackets):
.
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width alphasum
.
.It Sy alphasum
.Sy [ alpha ]
Recalculate and restore the Alpha checksum.
This is the default for
.Nx Ns Tn /alpha .
.
.It Sy append
.Sy [ alpha ,
.Sy pmax ,
.Sy vax ]
Append
.Ar primary
to the end of
.Ar filesystem ,
which must be a regular file in this case.
.
.It Sy command=<boot command>
.Sy [ amiga ]
Modify the default boot command line.
.
.It Sy sunsum
.Sy [ alpha ,
.Sy pmax ,
.Sy vax ]
Recalculate and restore the Sun and
.Nx Ns Tn /sparc
compatible checksum.
.Em Note :
The existing
.Nx Ns Tn /sparc
disklabel should use no more than 4 partitions.
.El
.
.It Fl t Ar fstype
Use
.Ar fstype
as the type of
.Ar filesystem .
The default operation is to attempt to auto-detect this setting.
The following file system types are currently supported by
.Nm :
.
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width ffs
.
.It Sy ffs
.Bx
Fast File System.
.
.It Sy raw
.Sq Raw
image.
Note: if a platform needs to hard-code the block offset of the secondary
bootstrap, it cannot be searched for on this file system type, and must
be provided with
.Fl B Ar s2bno .
.El
.
.It Fl v
Verbose operation.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
exits 0 on success, and \*[Gt]0 if an error occurs.
.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
uses the following environment variables:
.
.Bl -tag -width "MACHINE"
.
.It Ev MACHINE
Default value for
.Ar machine ,
overriding the result from
.Xr uname 3 .
.
.El
.
.Sh FILES
Most
.Nx
ports will contain variations of the following files:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width /usr/mdec/boot.$MACHINE
.
.It Pa /usr/mdec/bootxx_ Ns Sy FSTYPE
Primary bootstrap for file system type
.Sy FSTYPE .
Installed into the bootstrap area of the file system by
.Nm .
.

.Sh BUGS
There are not currently primary bootstraps to support all file systems
types which are capable of being the root file system.
.
.Ss NetBSD/alpha
The
.Nx Ns Tn /alpha
primary bootstrap program can only load the secondary bootstrap program
from file systems starting at the beginning (block 0) of disks.
Similarly, the secondary bootstrap program can only load kernels from
file systems starting at the beginning of disks.
.Pp
The size of primary bootstrap programs is restricted to 7.5KB, even
though some file systems (e.g. ISO 9660) are able to accommodate larger
ones.
.
.Ss NetBSD/pmax
The
.Nx Ns Tn /pmax
secondary bootstrap program can only load kernels from file
systems starting at the beginning of disks.
.Pp
The size of primary bootstrap programs is restricted to 7.5KB, even
though some file systems (e.g. ISO 9660) are able to accommodate larger
ones.
.
.Ss NetBSD/sun2 and NetBSD/sun3
The
.Nx Ns Tn /sun2
and
.Nx Ns Tn /sun3
secondary bootstrap program can only load kernels from file
systems starting at the beginning of disks.
