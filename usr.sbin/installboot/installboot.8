.Ar bootstrap
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility installs and removes
.Nx
disk bootstrap software into a file system.
.Nm
can install
.Ar primary
into
.Ar filesystem ,
or disable an existing bootstrap in
.Ar filesystem .
.Ss Traditional NetBSD boot
Generally,
.Nx
disk bootstrap software consists of two parts: a
.Dq primary
bootstrap program usually written into the disklabel area of the
file system by
.Nm ,
and a
.Dq secondary
bootstrap program that usually resides as an ordinary file in the file system.
.Pp
When booting, the primary bootstrap program is loaded and invoked by
the machine's
.Tn PROM
or
.Tn BIOS .
After receiving control of the system it loads and runs the secondary
bootstrap program, which in turn loads and runs the kernel.
The secondary bootstrap may allow control over various boot parameters
passed to the kernel.
.Pp
Perform the following steps to make a file system bootable:
.Bl -enum
.It
Copy the secondary bootstrap
.Po
usually
.Pa /usr/mdec/boot. Ns Aq Ar MACHINE\^
or
.Pa /usr/mdec/boot
.Pc
to the root directory of the target file system.
.
.It
Use
.Nm
to install the primary bootstrap program
.Po
usually
.Pa /usr/mdec/bootxx_ Ns Aq Ar FSTYPE\^
.Pc
into
.Ar filesystem .
.Pp
The following platforms do not require this step if the primary bootstrap
already exists and the secondary bootstrap file is just being updated:
.Sy alpha ,
.Sy amd64 ,
.Sy amiga ,
.Sy i386 ,
.Sy pmax ,
.Sy sparc64 ,
and
.Sy vax .
.Pp
The following platform does not require the first step since a
single bootstrap file is used.
The single bootstrap is installed like the primary bootstrap on
other platforms:
.Sy next68k .
.El
.Pp
On some architectures the options of an existing installed bootstrap,
or those of a bootstrap file can be changed.
Installing a new primary bootstrap will reset those options to default
values.
.Ss Embedded board types
Some platforms, typically embedded system platforms, are umbrella platforms
that support many different individual board types, each with their own
boot loader binary and installation procedure requirements.
On these platforms, it may be necessary to provide specific board type
information to
.Nm .
Information about known boards and their requirements is loaded from a
database at run-time.
Sometimes these platforms also require the use of 3rd-party boot loader
software, such as \*(UB.
To support these platforms,
.Nm
scans known locations for these 3rd-party boot loader packages for
database overlays that contain additional board-specific boot loader
installation information in a file called
.Pa installboot.plist .
.Pp
The following platforms have this requirement and utilize this database
overlay feature:
.Sy evbarm .
.Ss UEFI boot
On platforms that boot with
.Tn UEFI ,
there is a single boot loader in the
.Tn EFI
system partition at
.Pa EFI/boot/boot Ns Ao Ar ARCH\^ Ac Ns Pa .efi
where
.Ar ARCH
is the
.Tn UEFI
name for the architecture, such as
.Li ia32
.Pq Nx Ns /i386 ,
.Li x64
.Pq Nx Ns /amd64 ,
or
.Li aa64
.Pq Nx Ns /aarch64 .
.Pp
.Nm
is not needed for
.Tn UEFI
boot.
However, it may be used on a platform that supports
.Tn UEFI
boot to make a
hybrid image that can be booted
.Em either
with
.Tn UEFI
boot or with, e.g.,
.Tn BIOS
or \*(UB.
Hybrid images may also require a special
.Tn GPT
for
.Tn BIOS
boot; see
.Xr gpt 8 .
.Ss Options
The options and arguments recognized by
.Nm
are as follows:
.
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.
.It Fl B Ar s2bno
When hard-coding the blocks of
.Ar secondary
into
.Ar primary ,
start from block
.Ar s2bno
instead of trying to determine the block numbers occupied by
.Ar secondary
by examining
.Ar filesystem .
If this option is supplied,
.Ar secondary
should refer to an actual secondary bootstrap
.Po
rather than the file name of the one present in
.Ar filesystem
.Pc
so that its size can be determined.
.
.It Fl b Ar s1bno
Install
.Ar primary
at block number
.Ar s1bno
instead of the default location for the machine and file system type.
.Sy [ alpha ,
.Sy i386/amd64
.Po
.Pa bootxx_fat16
only
.Pc ,
.Sy pmax ,
.Sy vax ]
.
.It Fl c
Clear (remove) any existing bootstrap instead of installing one.
.
.It Fl e
Edit the options of an existing bootstrap.
This can be used to change the options in
.Pa bootxx_ Ns Aq Ar FSTYPE\^
files,
raw disk partitions, and the
.Pa pxeboot_ia32.bin
file.
With
.Fl v
and without
.Fl o ,
show the current options.
.Sy [ amd64 , i386 ]
.
.It Fl f
Forces
.Nm
to ignore some errors.
.
.It Fl m Ar machine

For example, an argument of
.Li zyz
would swap the lowercase letters
.Aq y
and
.Aq z .
.
.It Ic media Ns Li = Ns Ar type
.Sy [ evbarm ]
Some boards require a different boot loader binary and/or installation
procedure depending on what type of media will be used to boot the system.
For such boards, this option is required, and omitting it will display a
usage message that lists the valid media types for the board.
For boards that do not require special media handling, this option is
not allowed.

.Sy [ amd64 ,
.Sy i386 ]
Set the timeout before the automatic boot begins to the given number of seconds.
.El
.
.It Fl t Ar fstype

.
.It Ic raid
Mirrored RAIDframe File System.
.
.It Ic cd9660
ISO 9660 File System.
.
.It Ic raw
.Dq Raw

.Em Note :
if a platform needs to hard-code the block offset of the secondary
bootstrap, it cannot be searched for on this file system type, and must
be provided with
.Fl B Ar s2bno .
.El
.
.It Fl u Ar U-Boot-paths
.Ar U-Boot-paths
is a colon-separated list of search paths to scan for
\*(UB packages with
.Nm
installation overlays.
If multiple overlays are found, overlays from paths closer to the front
of the list take precedence.
If not specified, environment variable
.Ev INSTALLBOOT_UBOOT_PATHS
is used if defined; otherwise, the default path is
.Pa /usr/pkg/share/u-boot .
This option is only used on platforms that support
using \*(UB.
.
.It Fl v
Verbose operation.
.
.It Ar filesystem
The path name of the device or file system image that
.Nm
is to operate on.
It is not necessary for
.Ar filesystem
to be a currently mounted file system.
.
.It Ar primary
The path name of the
.Dq primary
boot block to install.
The path name must refer to a file in a file system that is currently
mounted.
.
.It Ar secondary
The path name of the
.Dq secondary
boot block, relative to the root of
the file system in the device or image specified by the
.Ar filesystem
argument.
Note that this may refer to a file in a file system that is not mounted.
Most systems require
.Ar secondary
to be in the
.Dq root
directory of the file system, so the leading
.Ql /
is not necessary on
.Ar secondary .
.Pp
Only certain combinations of
platform
.Pq Fl m Ar machine
and file system type
.Pq Fl t Ar fstype
require that the name of the secondary bootstrap is
supplied as
.Ar secondary ,
so that information such as the disk block numbers occupied
by the secondary bootstrap can be stored in the primary bootstrap.
These are:
.Bl -column "Platform" "File systems" -offset indent
.It Sy "Platform" Ta Sy "File systems"
.It macppc Ta ffs, raw
.It news68k Ta ffs, raw
.It newsmips Ta ffs, raw

.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width Ev
.
.It Ev INSTALLBOOT_UBOOT_PATHS
A colon-separated list of search paths to scan for
\*(UB packages with
.Nm
installation overlays.
If multiple overlays are found, overlays from paths closer to the front
of the list take precedence.
If not specified, the default path is

.Sh BUGS
There are not currently primary bootstraps to support all file systems
types which are capable of being the root file system.
.Pp
If a disk has been converted from
.Tn FFS
to
.Tn RAID
without the contents of the disk erased, then the original
.Tn FFS
installation may be auto-detected instead of the
.Tn RAID
installation.
In this case, the
.Fl t Ic raid
option must be provided.
.
.Ss NetBSD/alpha
The
.Nx Ns /alpha
primary bootstrap program can only load the secondary bootstrap program
from file systems starting at the beginning
.Pq block 0
of disks.
Similarly, the secondary bootstrap program can only load kernels from
file systems starting at the beginning of disks.
.Pp
The size of primary bootstrap programs is restricted to 7.5KB, even
though some file systems
.Pq e.g., ISO 9660
are able to accommodate larger ones.
.
.Ss NetBSD/hp300
The disk must have a boot partition large enough to hold the bootstrap code.
Currently the primary bootstrap must be a LIF format file.
.
.Ss NetBSD/i386 and NetBSD/amd64
The bootstrap must be installed in the
.Nx
partition that starts at the beginning of the
.Tn MBR
partition.
If that is a valid filesystem and contains the
.Pa /boot
program then it will be used as the root filesystem, otherwise the
.Ql a
partition will be booted.
.Pp
The size of primary bootstrap programs is restricted to 8KB, even
though some file systems
.Pq e.g., ISO 9660
are able to accommodate larger ones.
.
.Ss NetBSD/macppc
Due to restrictions in
.Nm
and the secondary bootstrap implementation, file systems where kernels exist
must start at the beginning of disks.
.Pp
Currently,
.Nm
doesn't recognize an existing Apple partition map on the disk
and always writes a faked map to make disks bootable.
.Pp
The
.Nx Ns /macppc
bootstrap program can't load kernels from FFSv2 partitions.
.
.Ss NetBSD/next68k
The size of bootstrap programs is restricted to the free space before
the file system at the beginning of the disk minus 8KB.
.
.Ss NetBSD/pmax
The
.Nx Ns /pmax
secondary bootstrap program can only load kernels from file
systems starting at the beginning of disks.
.Pp
The size of primary bootstrap programs is restricted to 7.5KB, even
though some file systems
.Pq e.g., ISO 9660
are able to accommodate larger ones.
.
.Ss NetBSD/sun2 and NetBSD/sun3
The
.Nx Ns /sun2
and
.Nx Ns /sun3
secondary bootstrap program can only load kernels from file
systems starting at the beginning of disks.
.
.Ss NetBSD/vax
The
.Nx Ns /vax
secondary bootstrap program can only load kernels from file systems
starting at the beginning of disks.
.Pp
The size of primary bootstrap programs is restricted to 7.5KB, even
though some file systems
.Pq e.g., ISO 9660
