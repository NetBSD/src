File: am-utils.info,  Node: host Selector Variable,  Next: hostd Selector Variable,  Prev: domain Selector Variable,  Up: Selectors

host Selector Variable
......................

   The local hostname as determined by gethostname(2).  If no domain
name was specified on the command line and the hostname contains a
period `.' then the string before the period is used as the host name,
and the string after the period is assigned to `${domain}'.  For
example, if the hostname is `styx.doc.ic.ac.uk' then `host' would be
`styx' and `domain' would be `doc.ic.ac.uk'.  `hostd' would be
`styx.doc.ic.ac.uk'.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: hostd Selector Variable,  Next: karch Selector Variable,  Prev: host Selector Variable,  Up: Selectors

hostd Selector Variable
.......................

   This resolves to the `${host}' and `${domain}' concatenated with a
`.' inserted between them if required.  If `${domain}' is an empty
string then `${host}' and `${hostd}' will be identical.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: karch Selector Variable,  Next: os Selector Variable,  Prev: hostd Selector Variable,  Up: Selectors

karch Selector Variable
.......................

   This is provided as a hook for the kernel architecture.  This is
used on SunOS 4 and SunOS 5, for example, to distinguish between
different `/usr/kvm' volumes.  `${karch}' defaults to the "machine"
value gotten from uname(2).  If the uname(2) system call is not
available, the value of `${karch}' defaults to that of `${arch}'.
Finally, a different value can be set with the `-k' command line option.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: os Selector Variable,  Next: osver Selector Variable,  Prev: karch Selector Variable,  Up: Selectors

os Selector Variable
....................

   The operating system.  Like the machine architecture, this is
automatically determined at compile time.  The operating system name can
be displayed by running the command `amd -v'.  *Note Supported
Platforms::.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: osver Selector Variable,  Next: key Selector Variable,  Prev: os Selector Variable,  Up: Selectors

osver Selector Variable
.......................

   The operating system version.  Like the machine architecture, this is
automatically determined at compile time.  The operating system name can
be displayed by running the command `amd -v'.  *Note Supported
Platforms::.

   The following selectors are also provided.  Unlike the other
selectors, they vary for each lookup.  Note that when the name from the
kernel is expanded prior to a map lookup, these selectors are all
defined as empty strings.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: key Selector Variable,  Next: map Selector Variable,  Prev: osver Selector Variable,  Up: Selectors

key Selector Variable
.....................

   The name being resolved.  For example, if `/home' is an automount
point, then accessing `/home/foo' would set `${key}' to the string
`foo'.  The key is prefixed by the PREF option set in the parent mount
point.  The default prefix is an empty string.  If the prefix was
`blah/' then `${key}' would be set to `blah/foo'.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: map Selector Variable,  Next: netnumber Selector Variable,  Prev: key Selector Variable,  Up: Selectors

map Selector Variable
.....................

   The name of the mount map being used.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: netnumber Selector Variable,  Next: network Selector Variable,  Prev: map Selector Variable,  Up: Selectors

netnumber Selector Variable
...........................

   This selector is identical to the `in_network' selector function,
see *Note in_network Selector Function::.  It will match either the name
or number of any network interface on which this host is connected to.
The names and numbers of all attached interfaces are available from the
output of `amd -v'.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: network Selector Variable,  Next: path Selector Variable,  Prev: netnumber Selector Variable,  Up: Selectors

network Selector Variable
.........................

   This selector is identical to the `in_network' selector function,
see *Note in_network Selector Function::.  It will match either the name
or number of any network interface on which this host is connected to.
The names and numbers of all attached interfaces are available from the
output of `amd -v'.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: path Selector Variable,  Next: wire Selector Variable,  Prev: network Selector Variable,  Up: Selectors

path Selector Variable
......................

   The full pathname of the name being resolved.  For example
`/home/foo' in the example above.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: wire Selector Variable,  Next: exists Selector Function,  Prev: path Selector Variable,  Up: Selectors

wire Selector Variable
......................

   This selector is identical to the `in_network' selector function,
see *Note in_network Selector Function::.  It will match either the name
or number of any network interface on which this host is connected to.
The names and numbers of all attached interfaces are available from the
output of `amd -v'.

   The following boolean functions are selectors which take an argument
ARG.  They return a value of true or false, and thus do not need to be
compared with a value.  Each of these may be negated by prepending `!'
to their name.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: exists Selector Function,  Next: false Selector Function,  Prev: wire Selector Variable,  Up: Selectors

exists Selector Function
........................

   If the file listed by ARG exists (via lstat(2)), this function
evaluates to true.  Otherwise it evaluates to false.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: false Selector Function,  Next: netgrp Selector Function,  Prev: exists Selector Function,  Up: Selectors

false Selector Function
.......................

   Always evaluates to false.  ARG is ignored.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: netgrp Selector Function,  Next: in_network Selector Function,  Prev: false Selector Function,  Up: Selectors

netgrp Selector Function
........................

   If the current host as determined by the value of `${host}' is a
member of the netgroup ARG, this selector evaluates to true.  Otherwise
it evaluates to false.

   For example, suppose you have a netgroup `ppp-hosts', and for
reasons of performance, these have a local `/home' partition, while all
other clients on the faster network can access a shared home directory.
A common map to use for both might look like the following:

     home/*  netgrp(ppp-hosts);type:=link;fs:=/local/${key} \
             !netgrp(ppp-hosts);type:=nfs;rhost=serv1;rfs:=/remote/${key}


File: am-utils.info,  Node: in_network Selector Function,  Next: true Selector Function,  Prev: netgrp Selector Function,  Up: Selectors

in_network Selector Function
............................

   If the current host has any network interface that is locally
attached to the network specified in ARG (either via name or number),
this selector evaluates to true.  Otherwise it evaluates to false.

   For example, suppose you have two servers that have an exportable
`/opt' that smaller clients can NFS mount.  The two servers are say,
`serv1' on network `foo-net.site.com' and `serv2' on network
`123.4.5.0'.  You can write a map to be used by all clients that will
attempt to mount the closest one as follows:

     opt in_network(foo-net.site.com);rhost:=serv1;rfs:=/opt \
         in_network(123.4.5.0);rhost:=serv2;rfs:=/opt \
         rhost:=fallback-server


File: am-utils.info,  Node: true Selector Function,  Prev: in_network Selector Function,  Up: Selectors

true Selector Function
......................

   Always evaluates to true.  ARG is ignored.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: Map Options,  Prev: Selectors,  Up: Location Format

Map Options
-----------

   Options are parsed concurrently with selectors.  The difference is
that when an option is seen the string following the `:=' is recorded
for later use.  As a minimum the TYPE option must be specified.  Each
filesystem type has other options which must also be specified.  *Note
Filesystem Types::, for details on the filesystem specific options.

   Superfluous option specifications are ignored and are not reported
as errors.

   The following options apply to more than one filesystem type.

* Menu:

* addopts Option::
* delay Option::
* fs Option::
* opts Option::
* remopts Option::
* sublink Option::
* type Option::


File: am-utils.info,  Node: addopts Option,  Next: delay Option,  Prev: Map Options,  Up: Map Options

addopts Option
..............

   This option adds additional options to default options normally
specified in the `/defaults' entry or the defaults of the key entry
being processed (*note opts Option::.).  Normally when you specify
`opts' in both the `/defaults' and the map entry, the latter overrides
the former completely.  But with `addopts' it will append the options
and override any conflicting ones.

   Options which start with `no' will override those with the same name
that do not start with `no' and vice verse.  Special handling is given
to inverted options such as `soft' and `hard', `bg' and `fg', `ro' and
`rw', etc.

   For example, if the default options specified were
     opts:=rw,nosuid,intr,rsize=1024,wsize=1024,quota,posix

   and the ones specified in a map entry were

     addopts:=grpid,suid,ro,rsize=2048,quota,nointr

   then the actual options used would be

     wsize=1024,posix,grpid,suid,ro,rsize=2048,quota,nointr


File: am-utils.info,  Node: delay Option,  Next: fs Option,  Prev: addopts Option,  Up: Map Options

delay Option
............

   The delay, in seconds, before an attempt will be made to mount from
the current location.  Auxiliary data, such as network address, file
handles and so on are computed regardless of this value.

   A delay can be used to implement the notion of primary and secondary
file servers.  The secondary servers would have a delay of a few
seconds, thus giving the primary servers a chance to respond first.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: fs Option,  Next: opts Option,  Prev: delay Option,  Up: Map Options

fs Option
.........

   The local mount point.  The semantics of this option vary between
filesystems.

   For NFS and UFS filesystems the value of `${fs}' is used as the
local mount point.  For other filesystem types it has other meanings
which are described in the section describing the respective filesystem
type.  It is important that this string uniquely identifies the
filesystem being mounted.  To satisfy this requirement, it should
contain the name of the host on which the filesystem is resident and the
pathname of the filesystem on the local or remote host.

   The reason for requiring the hostname is clear if replicated
filesystems are considered.  If a fileserver goes down and a
replacement filesystem is mounted then the "local" mount point "must"
be different from that of the filesystem which is hung.  Some encoding
of the filesystem name is required if more than one filesystem is to be
mounted from any given host.

   If the hostname is first in the path then all mounts from a
particular host will be gathered below a single directory.  If that
server goes down then the hung mount points are less likely to be
accidentally referenced, for example when getcwd(3) traverses the
namespace to find the pathname of the current directory.

   The `fs' option defaults to `${autodir}/${rhost}${rfs}'.  In
addition, `rhost' defaults to the local host name (`${host}') and `rfs'
defaults to the value of `${path}', which is the full path of the
requested file; `/home/foo' in the example above (*note Selectors::.).
`${autodir}' defaults to `/a' but may be changed with the `-a' command
line option.  Sun's automounter defaults to `/tmp_mnt'.  Note that
there is no `/' between the `${rhost}' and `${rfs}' since `${rfs}'
begins with a `/'.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: opts Option,  Next: remopts Option,  Prev: fs Option,  Up: Map Options

opts Option
...........

   The options to pass to the mount system call.  A leading `-' is
silently ignored.  The mount options supported generally correspond to
those used by mount(8) and are listed below.  Some additional
pseudo-options are interpreted by Amd and are also listed.

   Unless specifically overridden, each of the system default mount
options applies.  Any options not recognized are ignored.  If no
options list is supplied the string `rw,defaults' is used and all the
system default mount options apply.  Options which are not applicable
for a particular operating system are silently ignored.  For example,
only 4.4BSD is known to implement the `compress' and `spongy' options.

`acdirmax=N'
     Set the maximum directory attribute cache timeout to N.

`acdirmin=N'
     Set the minimum directory attribute cache timeout to N.

`acregmax=N'
     Set the maximum file attribute cache timeout to N.

`acregmin=N'
     Set the minimum file attribute cache timeout to N.

`actimeo=N'
     Set the overall attribute cache timeout to N.

`auto'
`ignore'
     Ignore this mount by df(1).

`cache'
     Allow data to be cached from a remote server for this mount.

`compress'
     Use NFS compression protocol.

`defperm'
     Ignore the permission mode bits, and default file permissions to
     0555, UID 0, and GID 0.  Useful for CD-ROMs formatted as ISO-9660.

`dev'
     Allow local special devices on this filesystem.

`dumbtimr'
     (XXX: a dumb timer?)

`fsid'
     Set ID of filesystem.

`grpid'
     Use BSD directory group-id semantics.

`int'
`intr'
     Allow keyboard interrupts on hard mounts.

`multi'
     Perform multi-component lookup on files.

`maxgroups'
     Set the maximum number of groups to allow for this mount.

`nfsv3'
     Use NFS Version 3 for this mount.

`noac'
     Turn off the attribute cache.

`noauto'
     (XXX: No automatic what?)

`nocache'
     Do not allow data to be cached from a remote server for this mount.

`noconn'
     Don't make a connection on datagram transports.

`nocto'
     No close-to-open consistency.

`nodefperm'
     Do not ignore the permission mode bits.  Useful for CD-ROMS
     formatted as ISO-9660.

`nodev'
`nodevs'
     Don't allow local special devices on this filesystem.

`noint'
     Do not allow keyboard interrupts for this mount

`nosub'
     Disallow mounts beneath this mount.

`nosuid'
     Don't allow set-uid or set-gid executables on this filesystem.

`noversion'
     Strip the extension `;#' from the version string of files recorded
     on an ISO-9660 CD-ROM.

`overlay'
     Overlay this mount on top of an existing mount, if any.

`pgthresh=N'
     Set the paging threshold to N kilobytes.

`port=N'
     Set the NFS port to N.

`posix'
     Turn on POSIX static pathconf for mounts.

`proto=S'
     Use transport protocol S for NFS (can be `"tcp"' or `"udp"').

`quota'
     Enable quota checking on this mount.

`rdonly'
`ro'
     Mount this filesystem readonly.

`resvport'
     Use a reserved port (smaller than 1024) for remote NFS mounts.
     Most systems assume that, but some allow for mounts to occur on
     non-reserved ports.   This causes problems when such a system
     tries to NFS mount one that requires reserved ports.  It is
     recommended that this option always be on.

`retrans=n'
     The number of NFS retransmits made before a user error is
     generated by a `soft' mounted filesystem, and before a `hard'
     mounted filesystem reports `NFS server "yoyo" not responding still
     trying'.

`retry'
     Set the NFS retry counter.

`rrip'
     Uses the Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol (RRIP) extensions to
     ISO-9660.

`rsize=N'
     The NFS read packet size.  You may need to set this if you are
     using NFS/UDP through a gateway or a slow link.

`rw'
     Allow reads and writes on this filesystem.

`soft'
     Give up after "retrans" retransmissions.

`spongy'
     Like `soft' for status requests, and `hard' for data transfers.

`suid'
     Allow set-uid programs on this mount.

`symttl'
     Turn of the symbolic link cache time-to-live.

`sync'
     Perform synchronous filesystem operations on this mount.

`tcp'
     Use TCP/IP instead of UDP/IP, ignored if the NFS implementation
     does not support TCP/IP mounts.

`timeo=N'
     The NFS timeout, in tenth-seconds, before a request is
     retransmitted.

`vers=N'
     Use NFS protocol version number N (can be 2 or 3).

`wsize=N'
     The NFS write packet size.  You may need to set this if you are
     using NFS/UDP through a gateway or a slow link.

   The following options are implemented by Amd, rather than being
passed to the kernel.

`nounmount'
     Configures the mount so that its time-to-live will never expire.
     This is also the default for some filesystem types.

`ping=N'
     The interval, in seconds, between keep-alive pings.  When four
     consecutive pings have failed the mount point is marked as hung.
     This interval defaults to 30 seconds.  If the ping interval is
     less than zero, no pings are sent and the host is assumed to be
     always up.  By default, pings are not sent for an NFS/TCP mount.

`retry=N'
     The number of times to retry the mount system call.

`utimeout=N'
     The interval, in seconds, by which the mount's time-to-live is
     extended after an unmount attempt has failed.  In fact the
     interval is extended before the unmount is attempted to avoid
     thrashing.  The default value is 120 seconds (two minutes) or as
     set by the `-w' command line option.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: remopts Option,  Next: sublink Option,  Prev: opts Option,  Up: Map Options

remopts Option
..............

   This option has the same use as `${opts}' but applies only when the
remote host is on a non-local network.  For example, when using NFS
across a gateway it is often necessary to use smaller values for the
data read and write sizes.  This can simply be done by specifying the
small values in REMOPTS.  When a non-local host is accessed, the
smaller sizes will automatically be used.

   Amd determines whether a host is local by examining the network
interface configuration at startup.  Any interface changes made after
Amd has been started will not be noticed.  The likely effect will be
that a host may incorrectly be declared non-local.

   Unless otherwise set, the value of `${remopts}' is the same as the
value of `${opts}'.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: sublink Option,  Next: type Option,  Prev: remopts Option,  Up: Map Options

sublink Option
..............

   The subdirectory within the mounted filesystem to which the reference
should point.  This can be used to prevent duplicate mounts in cases
where multiple directories in the same mounted filesystem are used.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: type Option,  Prev: sublink Option,  Up: Map Options

type Option
...........

   The filesystem type to be used.  *Note Filesystem Types::, for a full
description of each type.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: Amd Command Line Options,  Next: Filesystem Types,  Prev: Mount Maps,  Up: Top

Amd Command Line Options
************************

   Many of Amd's parameters can be set from the command line.  The
command line is also used to specify automount points and maps.

   The general format of a command line is

     amd [options] [{ directory map-name [-map-options] } ...]

   For each directory and map-name given or specified in the `amd.conf'
file, Amd establishes an automount point.  The "map-options" may be any
sequence of options or selectors--*note Location Format::..  The
"map-options" apply only to Amd's mount point.

   `type:=toplvl;cache:=mapdefault;fs:=${map}' is the default value for
the map options.  Default options for a map are read from a special
entry in the map whose key is the string `/defaults'.  When default
options are given they are prepended to any options specified in the
mount-map locations as explained in *Note Map Defaults::.

   The "options" are any combination of those listed below.

   Once the command line has been parsed, the automount points are
mounted.  The mount points are created if they do not already exist, in
which case they will be removed when Amd exits.  Finally, Amd
disassociates itself from its controlling terminal and forks into the
background.

   Note: Even if Amd has been built with `-DDEBUG' (via `configure
--enable-debug'), it will still background itself and disassociate
itself from the controlling terminal.  To use a debugger it is
necessary to specify `-D nodaemon' on the command line.  However, even
with all of this, mounts and unmounts are performed in the background,
and Amd will always fork before doing them.  Therefore, debugging what
happens closely during un/mounts is more challenging.

   *All* of Amd's command options (save `-F' and `-T') can be specified
in the `amd.conf' file. *Note Amd Configuration File::.  If Amd is
invoked without any command line options, it will default to using the
configuration file `/etc/amd.conf', if one exists.

* Menu:

* -a Option::   Automount directory.
* -c Option::   Cache timeout interval.
* -d Option::   Domain name.
* -k Option::   Kernel architecture.
* -l Option::   Log file.
* -n Option::   Hostname normalization.
* -o Option::   Operating system version.
* -p Option::   Output process id.
* -r Option::   Restart existing mounts.
* -t Option::   Kernel RPC timeout.
* -v Option::   Version information.
* -w Option::   Wait interval after failed unmount.
* -x Option::   Log options.
* -y Option::   NIS domain.
* -C-Option::   Cluster name.
* -D-Option::   Debug flags.
* -F Option::   Amd configuration file.
* -H Option::   Show brief help.
* -O-Option::   Operating system name.
* -S Option::   Lock executable pages in memory.
* -T-Option::   Set tag for configuration file.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: -a Option,  Next: -c Option,  Prev: Amd Command Line Options,  Up: Amd Command Line Options

`-a' DIRECTORY
==============

   Specifies the default mount directory.  This option changes the
variable `${autodir}' which otherwise defaults to `/a'.  For example,
some sites prefer `/amd' or `/n'.

     amd -a /amd ...


File: am-utils.info,  Node: -c Option,  Next: -d Option,  Prev: -a Option,  Up: Amd Command Line Options

`-c' CACHE-INTERVAL
===================

   Selects the period, in seconds, for which a name is cached by Amd.
If no reference is made to the volume in this period, Amd discards the
volume name to filesystem mapping.

   Once the last reference to a filesystem has been removed, Amd
attempts to unmount the filesystem.  If the unmount fails the interval
is extended by a further period as specified by the `-w' command line
option or by the `utimeout' mount option.

   The default "cache-interval" is 300 seconds (five minutes).


File: am-utils.info,  Node: -d Option,  Next: -k Option,  Prev: -c Option,  Up: Amd Command Line Options

`-d' DOMAIN
===========

   Specifies the host's domain.  This sets the internal variable
`${domain}' and affects the `${hostd}' variable.

   If this option is not specified and the hostname already contains the
local domain then that is used, otherwise the default value of
`${domain}' is `unknown.domain'.

   For example, if the local domain was `doc.ic.ac.uk', Amd could be
started as follows:

     amd -d doc.ic.ac.uk ...


File: am-utils.info,  Node: -k Option,  Next: -l Option,  Prev: -d Option,  Up: Amd Command Line Options

`-k' KERNEL-ARCHITECTURE
========================

   Specifies the kernel architecture of the system.  This is usually the
output of `uname -m' (the "machine" value gotten from uname(2)).  If
the uname(2) system call is not available, the value of `${karch}'
defaults to that of `${arch}'.

   The only effect of this option is to set the variable `${karch}'.

   This option would be used as follows:

     amd -k `arch -k` ...


File: am-utils.info,  Node: -l Option,  Next: -n Option,  Prev: -k Option,  Up: Amd Command Line Options

`-l' LOG-OPTION
===============

   Selects the form of logging to be made.  Several special
"log-options" are recognized.

  1. If "log-option" is the string `syslog', Amd will use the syslog(3)
     mechanism.  If your system supports syslog facilities, then the
     default facility used is `LOG_DAEMON'.

  2. When using syslog, if you wish to change the facility, append its
     name to the log option name, delimited by a single colon.  For
     example, if "log-options" is the string `syslog:local7' then Amd
     will log messages via syslog(3) using the `LOG_LOCAL7' facility.
     If the facility name specified is not recognized, Amd will default
     to `LOG_DAEMON'.  Note: while you can use any syslog facility
     available on your system, it is generally a bad idea to use those
     reserved for other services such as `kern', `lpr', `cron', etc.

  3. If "log-option" is the string `/dev/stderr', Amd will use standard
     error, which is also the default target for log messages.  To
     implement this, Amd simulates the effect of the `/dev/fd' driver.

   Any other string is taken as a filename to use for logging.  Log
messages are appended to the file if it already exists, otherwise a new
file is created.  The file is opened once and then held open, rather
than being re-opened for each message.

   Normally, when long-running daemons hold an open file descriptor on a
log file, it is impossible to "rotate" the log file and compress older
logs on a daily basis.  The daemon needs to be told to discard (via
close(2)) its file handle, and re-open the log file.  This is done
using `amq -l' log-option. *Note Amq -l option::.

   If the `syslog' option is specified but the system does not support
syslog or if the named file cannot be opened or created, Amd will use
standard error.  Error messages generated before Amd has finished
parsing the command line are printed on standard error.

   Since Amd tends to generate a lot of logging information (especially
if debugging was turned on), and due to it being an important program
running on the system, it is usually best to log to a separate disk
file.  In that case Amd would be started as follows:

     amd -l /var/log/amd ...


File: am-utils.info,  Node: -n Option,  Next: -o Option,  Prev: -l Option,  Up: Amd Command Line Options

`-n'
====

   Normalizes the remote hostname before using it.  Normalization is
done by replacing the value of `${rhost}' with the (generally fully
qualified) primary name returned by a hostname lookup.

   This option should be used if several names are used to refer to a
single host in a mount map.

`-o' OP-SYS-VER
===============

   Override the compiled-in version number of the operating system, with
OP-SYS-VER.  Useful when the built-in version is not desired for
backward compatibility reasons.  For example, if the built-in version is
`2.5.1', you can override it to `5.5.1', and use older maps that were
written with the latter in mind.

`-p'
====

   Causes Amd's process id to be printed on standard output.  This can
be redirected to a suitable file for use with kill:

     amd -p > /var/run/amd.pid ...

   This option only has an affect if Amd is running in daemon mode.  If
Amd is started with the `-D nodaemon' debug flag, this option is
ignored.

`-t' TIMEOUT.RETRANSMIT
=======================

   Specifies the RPC "timeout" and "retransmit" intervals used by the
kernel to communicate to Amd.  These are used to set the `timeo' and
`retrans' mount options.

   Amd relies on the kernel RPC retransmit mechanism to trigger mount
retries.  The value of this parameter changes the retry interval.  Too
long an interval gives poor interactive response, too short an interval
causes excessive retries.

`-w' WAIT-TIMEOUT
=================

   Selects the interval in seconds between unmount attempts after the
initial time-to-live has expired.

   This defaults to 120 seconds (two minutes).


File: am-utils.info,  Node: -x Option,  Next: -y Option,  Prev: -w Option,  Up: Amd Command Line Options

`-x' OPTS
=========

   Specifies the type and verbosity of log messages.  "opts" is a comma
separated list selected from the following options:

`fatal'
     Fatal errors

`error'
     Non-fatal errors

`user'
     Non-fatal user errors

`warn'
     Recoverable errors

`warning'
     Alias for `warn'

`info'
     Information messages

`map'
     Mount map usage

`stats'
     Additional statistics

`all'
     All of the above

   Initially a set of default logging flags is enabled.  This is as if
`-x all,nomap,nostats' had been selected.  The command line is parsed
and logging is controlled by the `-x' option.  The very first set of
logging flags is saved and can not be subsequently disabled using Amq.
This default set of options is useful for general production use.

   The `info' messages include details of what is mounted and unmounted
and when filesystems have timed out.  If you want to have the default
set of messages without the `info' messages then you simply need `-x
noinfo'.  The messages given by `user' relate to errors in the mount
maps, so these are useful when new maps are installed.  The following
table lists the syslog priorities used for each of the message types.

`fatal'
     `LOG_CRIT'

`error'
     `LOG_ERR'

`user'
     `LOG_WARNING'

`warning'
     `LOG_WARNING'

`info'
     `LOG_INFO'

`debug'
     `LOG_DEBUG'

`map'
     `LOG_DEBUG'

`stats'
     `LOG_INFO'

   The options can be prefixed by the string `no' to indicate that this
option should be turned off.  For example, to obtain all but `info'
messages the option `-x all,noinfo' would be used.

   If Amd was built with debugging enabled the `debug' option is
automatically enabled regardless of the command line options.

`-y' NIS-DOMAIN
===============

   Selects an alternate NIS domain.  This is useful for debugging and
cross-domain shared mounting.  If this flag is specified, Amd
immediately attempts to bind to a server for this domain.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: -C-Option,  Next: -D-Option,  Prev: -y Option,  Up: Amd Command Line Options

`-C' CLUSTER-NAME
=================

   Specifies the name of the cluster of which the local machine is a
member.  The only effect is to set the variable `${cluster}'.  The
"cluster-name" is will usually obtained by running another command
which uses a database to map the local hostname into a cluster name.
`${cluster}' can then be used as a selector to restrict mounting of
replicated data.  If this option is not given, `${cluster}' has the
same value as `${domain}'.  This would be used as follows:

     amd -C `clustername` ...


File: am-utils.info,  Node: -D-Option,  Next: -F Option,  Prev: -C-Option,  Up: Amd Command Line Options

`-D' OPTS
=========

   Controls the verbosity and coverage of the debugging trace; "opts"
is a comma separated list of debugging options.  The `-D' option is
only available if Amd was compiled with `-DDEBUG', or configured with
`configure --enable-debug'.  The memory debugging facilities (`mem')
are only available if Amd was compiled with `-DDEBUG_MEM' (in addition
to `-DDEBUG'), or configured with `configure --enable-debug=mem'.

   The most common options to use are `-D trace' and `-D test' (which
turns on all the useful debug options).  As usual, every option can be
prefixed with `no' to turn it off.

`all'
     all options

`amq'
     register for amq

`daemon'
     enter daemon mode

`fork'
     fork server

`full'
     program trace

`info'
     info service specific debugging (hesiod, nis, etc.)  In the case of
     hesiod maps, turns on the hesiod RES_DEBUG internal debugging
     option.

`mem'
     trace memory allocations

`mtab'
     use local `./mtab' file

`str'
     debug string munging

`test'
     full debug but no daemon

`trace'
     protocol trace

   You may also refer to the program source for a more detailed
explanation of the available options.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: -F Option,  Next: -H Option,  Prev: -D-Option,  Up: Amd Command Line Options

`-F' CONF-FILE
==============

   Specify an Amd configuration file CONF-FILE to use.  For a
description of the format and syntax, *note Amd Configuration File::..
This configuration file is used to specify any options in lieu of typing
many of them on the command line.  The `amd.conf' file includes
directives for every command line option Amd has, and many more that
are only available via the configuration file facility.  The
configuration file specified by this option is processed after all other
options had been processed, regardless of the actual location of this
option on the command line.

File: am-utils.info,  Node: -O-Option,  Next: -S Option,  Prev: -H Option,  Up: Amd Command Line Options

`-O' OP-SYS-NAME
================

   Override the compiled-in name of the operating system, with
OP-SYS-NAME.  Useful when the built-in name is not desired for backward
compatibility reasons.  For example, if the build in name is `sunos5',
you can override it to the old name `sos5', and use older maps which
were written with the latter in mind.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: -S Option,  Next: -T-Option,  Prev: -O-Option,  Up: Amd Command Line Options

`-S'
====

   Do *not* lock the running executable pages of Amd into memory.  To
improve Amd's performance, systems that support the plock(3) call lock
the Amd process into memory.  This way there is less chance the
operating system will schedule, page out, and swap the Amd process as
needed.  This tends to improve Amd's performance, at the cost of
reserving the memory used by the Amd process (making it unavailable for
other processes).  If this behavior is not desired, use the `-S' option.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: -T-Option,  Prev: -S Option,  Up: Amd Command Line Options

`-T' TAG
========

   Specify a tag to use with `amd.conf'.  All map entries tagged with
TAG will be processed.  Map entries that are not tagged are always
processed.  Map entries that are tagged with a tag other than TAG will
not be processed.

Filesystem Types
****************

   To mount a volume, Amd must be told the type of filesystem to be
used.  Each filesystem type typically requires additional information
such as the fileserver name for NFS.

   From the point of view of Amd, a "filesystem" is anything that can
resolve an incoming name lookup.  An important feature is support for
multiple filesystem types.  Some of these filesystems are implemented
in the local kernel and some on remote fileservers, whilst the others
are implemented internally by Amd.

   The two common filesystem types are UFS and NFS.  Four other user
accessible filesystems (`link', `program', `auto' and `direct') are
also implemented internally by Amd and these are described below.
There are two additional filesystem types internal to Amd which are not
directly accessible to the user (`inherit' and `error').  Their use is
described since they may still have an effect visible to the user.

Network Filesystem (`nfs')
==========================

   The "nfs" (`type:=nfs') filesystem type provides access to Sun's NFS.

The following options must be specified:

`rhost'
     the remote fileserver.  This must be an entry in the hosts
     database.  IP addresses are not accepted.  The default value is
     taken from the local host name (`${host}') if no other value is
     specified.

`rfs'
     the remote filesystem.  If no value is specified for this option,
     an internal default of `${path}' is used.

   NFS mounts require a two stage process.  First, the "file handle" of
the remote file system must be obtained from the server.  Then a mount
system call must be done on the local system.  Amd keeps a cache of
file handles for remote file systems.  The cache entries have a
lifetime of a few minutes.

   If a required file handle is not in the cache, Amd sends a request
to the remote server to obtain it.  Amd "does not" wait for a response;
it notes that one of the locations needs retrying, but continues with
any remaining locations.  When the file handle becomes available, and
assuming none of the other locations was successfully mounted, Amd will
retry the mount.  This mechanism allows several NFS filesystems to be
mounted in parallel.  The first one which responds with a valid file
handle will be used.

An NFS entry might be:

     jsp  host!=charm;type:=nfs;rhost:=charm;rfs:=/home/charm;sublink:=jsp

   The mount system call and any unmount attempts are always done in a
new task to avoid the possibility of blocking Amd.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: Network Host Filesystem,  Next: Network Filesystem Group,  Prev: Network Filesystem,  Up: Filesystem Types

Network Host Filesystem (`host')
================================

   The "host" (`type:=host') filesystem allows access to the entire
export tree of an NFS server.  The implementation is layered above the
`nfs' implementation so keep-alives work in the same way.  The only
option which needs to be specified is `rhost' which is the name of the
fileserver to mount.

   The `host' filesystem type works by querying the mount daemon on the
given fileserver to obtain its export list.  Amd then obtains
filehandles for each of the exported filesystems.  Any errors at this
stage cause that particular filesystem to be ignored.  Finally each
filesystem is mounted.  Again, errors are logged but ignored.  One
common reason for mounts to fail is that the mount point does not exist.
Although Amd attempts to automatically create the mount point, it may
be on a remote filesystem to which Amd does not have write permission.

   When an attempt to unmount a `host' filesystem mount fails, Amd
remounts any filesystems which had successfully been unmounted.  To do
this Amd queries the mount daemon again and obtains a fresh copy of the
export list.  Amd then tries to mount any exported filesystems which
are not currently mounted.

   Sun's automounter provides a special `-hosts' map.  To achieve the
same effect with Amd requires two steps.  First a mount map must be
created as follows:

     *       type:=host;rhost:=${key};fs:=${autodir}/${rhost}/root

and then start Amd with the following command

     amd /net net.map

where `net.map' is the name of map described above.  Note that the
value of `${fs}' is overridden in the map.  This is done to avoid a
clash between the mount tree and any other filesystem already mounted
from the same fileserver.

   If different mount options are needed for different hosts then
additional entries can be added to the map, for example

     host2       opts:=ro,nosuid,soft

would soft mount `host2' read-only.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: Network Filesystem Group,  Next: Unix Filesystem,  Prev: Network Host Filesystem,  Up: Filesystem Types

Network Filesystem Group (`nfsx')
=================================

   The "nfsx" (`type:=nfsx') filesystem allows a group of filesystems
to be mounted from a single NFS server.  The implementation is layered
above the `nfs' implementation so keep-alives work in the same way.

   The options are the same as for the `nfs' filesystem with one
difference.

The following options must be specified:

`rhost'
     the remote fileserver.  This must be an entry in the hosts
     database.  IP addresses are not accepted.  The default value is
     taken from the local host name (`${host}') if no other value is
     specified.

`rfs'
     as a list of filesystems to mount.  The list is in the form of a
     comma separated strings.

For example:

     pub  type:=nfsx;rhost:=gould;\
          rfs:=/public,/,graphics,usenet;fs:=${autodir}/${rhost}/root

   The first string defines the root of the tree, and is applied as a
prefix to the remaining members of the list which define the individual
filesystems.  The first string is *not* used as a filesystem name.  A
parallel operation is used to determine the local mount points to
ensure a consistent layout of a tree of mounts.

   Here, the *three* filesystems, `/public', `/public/graphics' and
`/public/usenet', would be mounted.

   A local mount point, `${fs}', *must* be specified.  The default
local mount point will not work correctly in the general case.  A
suggestion is to use `fs:=${autodir}/${rhost}/root'.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: Unix Filesystem,  Next: Caching Filesystem,  Prev: Network Filesystem Group,  Up: Filesystem Types

Unix Filesystem (`ufs', `xfs', or `efs')
========================================

   The "ufs" (`type:=ufs') filesystem type provides access to the
system's standard disk filesystem--usually a derivative of the Berkeley
Fast Filesystem.

The following option must be specified:

`dev'
     the block special device to be mounted.

   A UFS entry might be:

     jsp   host==charm;type:=ufs;dev:=/dev/sd0d;sublink:=jsp

   UFS is the default Unix disk-based file system, which Am-utils picks
up during the autoconfiguration phase.  Some systems have more than one
type, such as IRIX, that comes with EFS (Extent File System) and XFS
(Extended File System).  In those cases, you may explicitly set the file
system type, by using entries such:

     ez1   type:=efs;dev:=/dev/xd0a
     ez2   type:=xfs;dev:=/dev/sd3c


File: am-utils.info,  Node: Caching Filesystem,  Next: CD-ROM Filesystem,  Prev: Unix Filesystem,  Up: Filesystem Types

Caching Filesystem (`cachefs')
==============================

   The "cachefs" (`type:=cachefs') filesystem caches files from one
location onto another, presumably providing faster access.  It is
particularly useful to cache from a larger and remote (slower) NFS
partition to a smaller and local (faster) UFS directory.

The following options must be specified:

`cachedir'
     the directory where the cache is stored.

`rfs'
     the path name to the "back file system" to be cached from.

`fs'
     the "front file system" mount point to the cached files, where Amd
     will set a symbolic link pointing to.

   A CacheFS entry for, say, the `/import' Amd mount point, might be:

     copt  type:=cachefs;cachedir:=/cache;rfs:=/import/opt;fs:=/n/import/copt

   Access to the pathname `/import/copt' will follow a symbolic link to
`/n/import/copt'.  The latter is the mount point for a caching file
system, that caches from `/import/opt' to `/cache'.

   Caveats:
  1. This file system is currently only implemented for Solaris 2.x!

  2. Before being used for the first time, the cache directory must be
     initialized with `cfsadmin -c CACHEDIR'.  See the manual page for
     cfsadmin(1M) for more information.

  3. The "back file system" mounted must be a complete file system, not
     a subdirectory thereof; otherwise you will get an error "Invalid
     Argument".

  4. If Amd aborts abnormally, the state of the cache may be
     inconsistent, requiring running the command `fsck -F cachefs
     CACHEDIR'.  Otherwise you will get the error "No Space Left on
     Device".

CD-ROM Filesystem (`cdfs')
==========================

   The "cdfs" (`type:=cdfs') filesystem mounts a CD-ROM with an ISO9660
format filesystem on it.

The following option must be specified:

`dev'
     the block special device to be mounted.

   A cdfs entry might be:

     cdfs      os==sunos4;type:=cdfs;dev:=/dev/sr0 \
               os==sunos5;type:=cdfs;dev:=/dev/dsk/c0t6d0s2


File: am-utils.info,  Node: Loopback Filesystem,  Next: Memory/RAM Filesystem,  Prev: CD-ROM Filesystem,  Up: Filesystem Types

Loopback Filesystem (`lofs')
============================

   The "lofs" (`type:=lofs') filesystem is also called the loopback
filesystem.  It mounts a local directory on another, thus providing
mount-time binding to another location (unlike symbolic links).

   The loopback filesystem is particularly useful within the context of
a chroot-ed directory (via chroot(2)), to provide access to directories
otherwise inaccessible.

The following option must be specified:

`rfs'
     the pathname to be mounted on top of `${fs}'.

   Usually, the FTP server runs in a chroot-ed environment, for security
reasons.  In this example, lofs is used to provide a subdirectory within
a user's home directory, also available for public ftp.

     lofs      type:=lofs;rfs:=/home/ezk/myftpdir;fs:=/usr/ftp/pub/ezk

Memory/RAM Filesystem (`mfs')
=============================

   The "mfs" (`type:=mfs') filesystem is available in 4.4BSD, Linux,
and other systems.  It creates a filesystem in a portion of the
system's memory, thus providing very fast file (volatile) access.

   XXX: THIS FILESYSTEM IS NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!


File: am-utils.info,  Node: Null Filesystem,  Next: Floppy Filesystem,  Prev: Memory/RAM Filesystem,  Up: Filesystem Types

Null Filesystem (`nullfs')
==========================

   The "nullfs" (`type:=nullfs') filesystem is available from 4.4BSD,
and is very similar to the loopback filesystem, "lofs".

   XXX: THIS FILESYSTEM IS NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!
