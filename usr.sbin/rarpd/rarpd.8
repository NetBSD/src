.Sh NAME
.Nm rarpd
.Nd Reverse ARP Daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl adfl
.Oo
.Ar interface
.Op Ar ...
.Oc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
services Reverse ARP requests on the Ethernet connected to
.Ar interface .
Upon receiving a request,
.Nm
maps the target hardware address to an IP address via its name, which
must be present in both the
.Xr ethers 5
and
.Xr hosts 5
databases.
If a host does not exist in both databases the translation cannot
proceed and a reply will not be sent.
.\" .Pp
.\" Additionally, a request is honored only if the server
.\" (the host that rarpd is running on)
.\" can `boot' the target.
.\" .Pp
.\" To be considered able to boot the target the server must have
.\" a file or directory
.\" .Pa /tftpboot/ Ns Em ipaddr
.\" where
.\" .Pa ipaddr
.\" is the target IP address as an eight digit hexadecimal string.
.\" For example, the IP address 203.8.3.18 is represented as
.\" .Sq CB080312 .
.Pp
In normal operation,
.Nm
forks a copy of itself and runs in
the background.  Anomalies and errors are reported via
.Xr syslog 3 .
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Listen on all the Ethernets attached to the system.
If
.Sq Fl a
is omitted, an interface must be specified.
.It Fl d
Run in debug mode, with all the output to stderr.
This option implies the
.Fl f
option.
.It Fl f
Run in the foreground.
.It Fl l
Log all requests to syslog.
