.Sh NAME
.Nm pac
.Nd printer/plotter accounting information
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl cmrs
.Bk -words
.Op Fl P Ar printer
.Ek
.Bk -words
.Op Fl p Ar price
.Ek
.Op Ar name ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads the printer/plotter accounting files, accumulating the number
of pages (the usual case) or feet (for raster devices)
of paper consumed by each user, and printing out
how much each user consumed in pages or feet and dollars.
.Pp
Options and operands available:
.Bl -tag -width PPprinter
.It Fl P Ns Ar printer
Accounting is done for the named printer.
Normally, accounting is done for the default printer (site dependent) or
the value of the environment variable
.Ev PRINTER
is used.
.It Fl c
flag causes the output to be sorted by cost; usually the
output is sorted alphabetically by name.
.It Fl m
flag causes the host name to be ignored in the accounting file.  This
allows for a user on multiple machines to have all of his printing
charges grouped together.
.It Fl p Ns Ar price
The value
.Ar price
is used for the cost in dollars instead of the default value of 0.02
or the price specified in
.Pa /etc/printcap .
.It Fl r
Reverse the sorting order.
.It Fl s
Accounting information is summarized on the
summary accounting file; this summarization is necessary since on a
busy system, the accounting file can grow by several lines per day.
.It Ar names
Statistics are only printed for user(s)
.Ar name ;
usually, statistics are printed for every user who has used any paper.
.El
.Sh OUTPUT FORMAT
.Nm
formats the output into simple table, using four columns - number of feets
or pages (column "pages/feet"), how many copies were made (column "runs"),
total price for this print (column "price") and user login with host name
(column "login" or "host name and login"). If argument
.Ar name
was not used and hence
.Nm
is printing information for all users,
a summary line with print totals (runs, pages, price) is appended.
.Pp
Note that
.Nm
on other system might print the price as price per copy.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/account/?_sum -compact
.It Pa /var/account/?acct
raw accounting files
.It Pa /var/account/?_sum
summary accounting files
.It Pa /etc/printcap
printer capability data base
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr printcap 5
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.0 .
.Sh BUGS
The relationship between the computed price and reality is
as yet unknown.
