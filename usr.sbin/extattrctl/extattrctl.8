.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
is the management utility for extended attributes over the UFS1 file system.
It allows the starting and stopping of extended attributes on a file system,
as well as initialization of attribute backing files, and enabling and
disabling of specific extended attributes on a file system.
.Pp
The first argument on the command line indicates the operation to be
performed.
Operation must be one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm start Ar path
Start extended attribute support on the file system named using
.Ar path .
The file system must be a UFS1 file system, and the
.Dv UFS_EXTATTR
kernel option must have been enabled.
.It Cm stop Ar path
Stop extended attribute support on the file system named using
.Ar path .
Extended attribute support must previously have been started.
.It Cm initattr Oo Fl f Oc Oo Fl p Ar path Oc Ar attrsize attrfile
Create and initialize a file to use as an attribute backing file.
You must specify a maximum per-inode size for the attribute in bytes in
.Ar attrsize ,
as well as the file where the attribute will be stored, using
.Ar attrfile .
.Pp
The
.Fl f
argument may be used to indicate that it is alright to overwrite an
existing attribute backing file; otherwise, if the target file exists,
an error will be returned.
.Pp
The
.Fl p Ar path
argument may be used to preallocate space for all attributes rather than
relying on sparse files to conserve space.
This has the advantage of guaranteeing that space will be available
for attributes when they are written, preventing low disk space conditions
from denying attribute service.
.Pp
This file should not exist before running
.Cm initattr .
.It Cm showattr Ar attrfile
Show the attribute header values in the attribute file named by
.Ar attrfile .
.It Cm enable Ar path attrnamespace attrname attrfile
Enable an attribute named
.Ar attrname
in the namespace
.Ar attrnamespace
on the file system identified using
.Ar path ,
and backed by initialized attribute file
.Ar attrfile .
Available namespaces are
.Dq user
and
.Dq system .
The backing file must have been initialized using
.Cm initattr
before its first use.
Attributes must have been started on the file system prior to the
enabling of any attributes.
.It Cm disable Ar path attrnamespace attrname
Disable the attributed named
.Ar attrname
in namespace
.Ar attrnamespace
on the file system identified by
.Ar path .
Available namespaces are
.Dq user
and
.Dq system .
The file system must have attributes started on it, and the attribute
most have been enabled using
.Cm enable .
.El
.Pp
The kernel also includes support for automatic starting of extended
attributes on a file system at mount time once configured with
.Nm .
If the kernel is built with the
.Dv UFS_EXTATTR_AUTOSTART
option, UFS will search for a
.Pa .attribute
sub-directory of the file system root during the mount operation.
If found, extended attribute support will be started for the file system.
UFS will then search for
.Pa system
and
.Pa user
sub-directories of the
.Pa .attribute
directory for any potential backing files and enable an extended attribute
for each valid backing file with the backing file name as the attribute
name.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl extattrctl start /
.Pp
Start extended attributes on the root file system.
.Pp
.Dl extattrctl initattr 17 /.attribute/system/md5
.Pp
Create an attribute backing file in
.Pa /.attribute/system/md5 ,
and set the maximum size of each attribute to 17 bytes, with a
sparse file used for storing the attributes.
.Pp
.Dl extattrctl enable / system md5 /.attribute/system/md5
.Pp
Enable an attribute named md5 on the root file system, backed from the file
.Pa /.attribute/system/md5 .
.Pp
.Dl extattrctl disable / md5
.Pp
Disable the attribute named md5 on the root file system.
.Pp
.Dl extattrctl stop /
.Pp
Stop extended attributes on the root file system.

.Sh HISTORY
Extended attribute support was developed as part of the TrustedBSD
Project, and introduced in
.Fx 5.0
and
.Nx 4.0 .
It was developed to support security extensions requiring additional
labels to be associated with each file or directory.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Robert N M Watson
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
works only on UFS1 file systems.
The kernel support for extended attribute backing files and this
control program should be generalized for any file system that
lacks native extended attribute support.
