.Sh NAME
.Nm btdevctl
.Nd Bluetooth remote device control utility
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl A | Fl D
.Op Fl qv
.Op Fl m Ar mode
.Fl a Ar address
.Fl d Ar device
.Fl s Ar service
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to configure bluetooth devices in the system.
Normally,
.Nm
will perform an SDP query to the remote device as needed, and
cache the results in the
.Pa /var/db/btdevctl.plist
file for later use.
If neither Attach nor Detach is specified,
.Nm
will display the configuration.
.Pp
The options are:
.Bl -tag
.It Fl A
Attach device
.It Fl a Ar address
Remote device address.
The
.Ar address
may be given as BDADDR or a name.
If a name was specified,
.Nm
attempts to resolve the name via
.Xr bt_gethostbyname 3 .
.It Fl D
Detach device
.It Fl d Ar device
Local device address.
May be given as BDADDR or device name.
.It Fl m Ar mode
Connection link mode.
The following modes are supported:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width encrypt -compact
.It none
clear previously set mode.
.It auth
require devices be paired, see
.Xr btpin 1 .
.It encrypt
auth, plus enable encryption.
.It secure
encryption, plus change of link key.
.El
.Pp
When configuring the HID service,
.Nm
will set
.Sq auth
by default, or
.Sq encrypt
for keyboard devices.
If the device cannot handle authentication, then the mode will need
to be cleared manually.
.It Fl q
Ignore any cached data and perform a SDP query for the given
.Ar service .
.It Fl s Ar service
Service to configure.
Known services are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width HSETXX -compact
.It Dv HID
Human Interface Device.
.It Dv HF
Handsfree.
.It Dv HSET
Headset.
.El
.It Fl v
Be verbose.
.El
.Pp
For device configurations to persist across boots, add entries to the
.Pa /etc/bluetooth/btdevctl.conf
file and ensure the
.Xr rc.conf 5
variable
.Sy bluetooth
is set to YES.
