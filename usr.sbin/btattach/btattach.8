.Sh NAME
.Nm btattach
.Nd attach serial lines as Bluetooth HCI interfaces
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dFfoPp
.Op Fl i Ar speed
.Op Ar type
.Ar tty
.Ar speed
.Nm
.Fl t
.Op Fl dFfoPp
.Ar tty
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to assign a
.Ar tty
line to a Bluetooth Host Controller Interface using the
.Xr btuart 4
or
.Xr bcsp 4
line disciplines, and can optionally initialize the line for a
given device
.Ar type
before activating the line discipline.
.Pp
Supported types are:
.Bl -tag -compact -width ericssonxx -offset indent
.It Cm bcm2035
Broadcom BCM2035
.It Cm bcsp
Generic BCSP (BlueCore Serial Protocol)
.It Cm bgb2xx
Philips BGB2xx module
.It Cm btuart
Generic UART (this is the default)
.It Cm csr
Cambridge Silicon Radio Casira serial adapter, or
Brainboxes serial dongle (BL642)
.It Cm ericsson
Ericsson based modules
.It Cm digi
Digianswer based cards
.It Cm st
ST Microelectronics minikits based on STLC2410/STLC2415
.It Cm stlc2500
ST Microelectronics minikits based on STLC2500
.It Cm swave
Silicon Wave kits
.It Cm texas
Texas Instruments modules
.It Cm unistone
Infineon UniStone (PBA31308) modules
.El
.Pp
When the line discipline is activated,
.Nm
detaches and sleeps until it receives a
.Dv SIGHUP .
.Pp
The command line options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl i Ar speed"
.It Fl d
debug mode.
print initialization IO and do not detach.
.It Fl F
Disable flow control.
.It Fl f
Enable flow control.
.It Fl i Ar speed
Specify an alternate
.Ar speed
for the Bluetooth module to use during the initialization phase.
.It Fl o
Enable odd parity.
.It Fl P
Disable parity.
.It Fl p
Enable parity (even parity).
.It Fl t
Test mode.
.El
.Pp
Only the super-user may attach a Bluetooth HCI interface.
.Pp
Test mode tries to guess the speed using the received link-establish
packet from HCI, or
.Xr btuart 4 ,
if there is no response.
