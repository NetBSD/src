.Sh NAME
.Nm nfsd
.Nd remote
.Tn NFS
server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl 46drut
.Op Fl n Ar num_threads
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
runs on a server machine to service
.Tn NFS
requests from client machines.
At least one
.Nm
must be running for a machine to operate as a server.
.Pp
Unless otherwise specified, four servers for
.Tn UDP
transport are started.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Turn on debugging, don't fork and log to stderr.
.It Fl r
Register the
.Tn NFS
service with
.Xr rpcbind 8
without creating any servers.
This option can be used along with the
.Fl u
or
.Fl t
options to re-register NFS if the portmap server is restarted.
.It Fl n
Specifies how many server threads to create.
The default is 4.
A server should run enough threads to handle
the maximum level of concurrency from its clients.
.It Fl 4
Only listen to IPv4 requests.
By default
.Nm
listens to both IPv6 and IPv4 and tries to register for both.
.It Fl 6
Only listen to IPv6 requests.
.It Fl t
Serve only
.Tn TCP NFS
clients.
By default
.Nm
serves both
.Tn TCP NFS
and
.Tn UDP NFS
clients
.It Fl u
Serve only
.Tn UDP NFS
clients.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
listens for service requests at the port indicated in the
.Tn NFS
server specification; see
.%T "Network File System Protocol Specification" ,
RFC 1094 and
.%T "NFS: Network File System Version 3 Protocol Specification" .
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std nfsd
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dq Li "nfsd -n 6"
serves
.Tn UDP
and
.Tn TCP
transports using six threads.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr nfsstat 1 ,
.Xr nfssvc 2 ,
.Xr mountd 8 ,
.Xr rpcbind 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
