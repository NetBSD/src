.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command manipulates the address mapping table
used by the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP).
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl A Ar wait
Repeat
.Fl a
.Pq dump NDP entries
every
.Ar wait
seconds.
.It Fl a
Dump the currently existing NDP entries.
The following information will be printed:
.Bl -tag -width NeighborXX
.It Neighbor
IPv6 address of the neighbor.
.It Linklayer Address
Linklayer address of the neighbor.
It could be
.Dq Li (incomplete)
when the address is not available.
.It Netif
Network interface associated with the neighbor cache entry.
.It Expire
The time until expiry of the entry.
The entry could become
.Dq Li permanent ,
in which case it will never expire.
.It S
State of the neighbor cache entry, as a single letter:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It D
Delay
.It I
Incomplete
.It N
Nostate
.It P
Probe
.It R
Reachable
.It S
Stale
.It U
Unreachable
.It W
Waitdelete
.It ?
Unknown state (should never happen).
.El
.It Flags
Flags on the neighbor cache entry, in a single letter.
They are: Router, proxy neighbor advertisement
.Pq Dq p .
The field could be followed by a decimal number,
which means the number of NS probes the node has sent during the current state.
.El
.It Fl c
Erase all the NDP entries.
.It Fl d
Delete specified NDP entry.
.It Fl f
Parse the file specified by
.Ar filename .
.It Fl i Ar interface Op Ar expressions ...
View ND information for the specified interface.
If additional arguments
.Ar expressions
are given,
.Nm
sets or clears the flags or variables for the interface as specified in
the expression.
Each expression should be separated by white spaces or tab characters.
Possible expressions are as follows.
Some of the expressions can begin with the
special character
.Ql - ,
which means the flag specified in the expression should be cleared.
Note that you need
.Fl -
before
.Fl foo
in this case.
.\"
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic nud
Turn on or off NUD (Neighbor Unreachability Detection) on the
interface.
NUD is usually turned on by default.
.It Ic auto_linklocal
Specify whether or not to perform automatic link-local address configuration on
.Ar interface .
This flag is set by
.Li net.inet6.ip6.auto_linklocal
sysctl variable.
.It Ic prefer_source
Prefer addresses on the
.Ar interface
as candidates of the source address for outgoing packets.
The default value of this flag is off.
For more details about the entire algorithm of source address
selection, see the
.Pa IMPLEMENTATION
file supplied with the KAME kit.
.It Ic disabled
Disable IPv6 operation on the interface.
When disabled, the interface discards any IPv6 packets
received on or being sent to the interface and any IPv6 addresses
on the interface are marked as
.Dq tentative .
When the disabled flag is cleared, DAD will be performed.
In the sending case, an error of ENETDOWN will be returned to the
application.
This flag is typically set automatically in the kernel as a result of
a certain failure of Duplicate Address Detection.
While the flag can be set or cleared by hand with the
.Nm
command, it is not generally advisable to modify this flag manually.
.It Ic basereachable=(number)
Specify the BaseReachableTimer on the interface in millisecond.
.It Ic retrans=(number)
Specify the RetransTimer on the interface in millisecond.
.It Ic curhlim=(number)
Specify the Cur Hop Limit on the interface.
.El
.It Fl n
Do not try to resolve numeric addresses to hostnames.
.It Fl s
Register an NDP entry for a node.
The entry will be permanent unless the word
.Cm temp
is given in the command.
If the word
.Cm proxy
is given, this system will act as a proxy NDP server,
responding to requests for
.Ar hostname
even though the host address is not its own.
.It Fl t
Print timestamp on each entry,
making it possible to merge output with
.Xr tcpdump 8 .
Most useful when used with
.Fl A .
.El

.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
command will exit with 0 on success, and non-zero on errors.
