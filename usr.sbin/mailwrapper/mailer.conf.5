.Dt MAILER.CONF 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mailer.conf
.Nd configuration file for
.Xr mailwrapper 8
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Pa /etc/mailer.conf
contains a series of lines of the form
.Pp
.Pa name
.Pa program
.Op Ar arguments ...
.Pp
The first word of each line is the
.Pa name
of a program invoking
.Xr mailwrapper 8 .
(For example, on a typical system
.Pa /usr/sbin/sendmail
would be a symbolic link to
.Xr mailwrapper 8 ,
as would
.Xr newaliases 1
and
.Xr mailq 1 .
Thus,
.Pa name
might be
.Dq sendmail
or
.Dq newaliases
etc.)
.Pp
The second word of each line is the name of the
.Pa program
to actually execute when the first name is invoked.
.Pp
The further
.Ar arguments ,
if any, are passed to the
.Pa program ,
followed by the arguments
.Xr mailwrapper 8
was called with.
.Pp
The file may also contain comment lines, denoted by a
.Sq #
mark in the first column of any line.
.Pp
The default mailer is
.Xr postfix 1 ,
which will also start by default (unless specifically disabled via an
.Xr rc.conf 5
setting) so that locally generated mail can be delivered, if the
.Dq sendmail
setting in
.Pa /etc/mailer.conf
is set to
.Dq /usr/libexec/postfix/sendmail .
.Sh FILES
/etc/mailer.conf
.Sh EXAMPLES
This example shows how to set up
.Nm
to invoke the
.Xr postfix 1
program:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
sendmail        /usr/libexec/postfix/sendmail
mailq           /usr/libexec/postfix/sendmail
newaliases      /usr/libexec/postfix/sendmail
.Ed
.Pp
This example shows the use of the mini-sendmail package from
.Em pkgsrc
in place of
.Xr postfix 1 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# Send outgoing mail to a smart relay using mini-sendmail
sendmail	/usr/pkg/sbin/mini-sendmail -srelayhost
send-mail	/usr/pkg/sbin/mini-sendmail -srelayhost
.Ed
.Pp
Note the use of additional arguments.

.Sh BUGS
The entire reason this program exists is a crock.
Instead, a command
for how to submit mail should be standardized, and all the
.Dq behave differently if invoked with a different name
behavior of things like
.Xr mailq 1
should go away.
