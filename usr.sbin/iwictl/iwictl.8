.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility controls the operation of Intel(R) PRO/Wireless 2200BG/2915ABG
networking devices via the
.Xr iwi 4
driver.
.Pp
You should not use this program to configure IEEE 802.11 parameters.
Use
.Xr ifconfig 8
instead.
.Sh OPTIONS
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl i Ar iface
Displays adapter's internal statistics.
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl d Ar directory Oo Fl m Ar bss|ibss|monitor Oc
Download firmware binary image to the adapter.
The image is read from the
.Ar directory
directory.
By default, the firmware binary image for BSS (aka infrastructure
mode) mode is downloaded unless the
.Fl m
flag is given.
Firmware binary images can be found in the
.Pa pkgsrc/sysutils/iwi-firmware
package.
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl k
Kill the firmware and reset the adapter.
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl r
Displays the radio transmitter state (on or off).
