.Sh NAME
.Nm pstat
.Nd display system data structures
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Oo
.Fl T | Fl f | Fl s |
.Fl t | Fl v
.Oc
.Op Fl ghkmn
.Op Fl M Ar core
.Op Fl N Ar system
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
displays open file entry, swap space utilization,
terminal state, and vnode data structures.
If
.Ar corefile
is given, the information is sought there, otherwise
in
.Pa /dev/kmem .
The required namelist is taken from
.Pa /netbsd
unless
.Ar system
is specified.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl T
Prints the number of used and free slots for open files, used vnodes, and swap
space.
This option is useful for checking to see how large system tables
become if the system is under heavy load.
.It Fl f
Print the open file table with these headings:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It LOC
The core location of this table entry.
.It TYPE
The type of object the file table entry points to.
.It FLG
Miscellaneous state variables encoded thus:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It R
open for reading
.It W
open for writing
.It A
open for appending
.It S
shared lock present
.It X
exclusive lock present
.It I
signal pgrp when data ready
.El
.It CNT
Number of processes that know this open file.
.It MSG
Number of messages outstanding for this file.
.It DATA
The location of the vnode table entry or socket structure for this file.
.It USE
Number of active users of this open file.
.It IFLG
Value of internal flags.
.It OFFSET
The file offset (see
.Xr lseek 2 ) .
.El
.It Fl g
The
.Fl g
option uses (1024 * 1024 * 1024) byte blocks instead of the default 512 byte.
.It Fl h
Use
.Xr humanize_number 3
to display (swap) sizes.
.It Fl k
Use 1K-byte blocks.
.It Fl m
The
.Fl m
option uses (1024 * 1024) byte blocks instead of the default 512 byte.
.It Fl n
Print devices by major/minor number rather than by name.
.It Fl s
Print information about swap space usage on all the
swap areas compiled into the kernel.
The first column is the device name of the partition.
The next column is the total space available in the partition.
The
.Ar Used
column indicates the total blocks used so far;  the
.Ar Available
column indicates how much space is remaining on each partition.
The
.Ar Capacity
reports the percentage of space used.
.Pp
If more than one partition is configured into the system, totals for all
of the statistics will be reported in the final line of the report.
.It Fl t
Print table for terminals
with these headings:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It LINE
Physical device name.
.It RAW
Number of characters in raw input queue.
.It CAN
Number of characters in canonicalized input queue.
.It OUT
Number of characters in output queue.
.It HWT
High water mark for output.
.It LWT
Low water mark for output.
.It COL
Calculated column position of terminal.
.It STATE
Miscellaneous state variables encoded thus:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It T
delay timeout in progress
.\" .It W
.\" waiting for open to complete
.It O
open
.It F
outq has been flushed during DMA
.It C
carrier is on
.It B
busy doing output
.It A
process is awaiting output
.It X
open for exclusive use
.It S
output stopped
.It K
further input blocked
.It Y
tty in async I/O mode
.It D
state for lowercase
.Ql \e
work
.It E
within a
.Ql \e.../
for PRTRUB
.It L
next character is literal
.It P
retyping suspended input
.Pq PENDIN
.It N

.It \&>
tty used for dialout
.El
.It SESS
Session for which this is controlling terminal.
.It PGID
Current foreground process group associated with this terminal.
.It DISC
Line discipline;
.Ql term
for
TTYDISC (see
.Xr termios 4 ) ,
.Ql tab
for TABLDISC (see
.Xr tb 4 ) ,
.Ql slip
for SLIPDISC (see
.Xr sl 4 ) ,
.Ql ppp
for PPPDISC (see
.Xr ppp 4 ) ,
.Ql strip
for STRIPDISC (see
.Xr strip 4 ) ,
.Ql hdlc
for HDLCDISC.
.El
.It Fl v
Print the active vnodes.
Each group of vnodes corresponding to a particular filesystem is preceded
by a two line header.
The first line consists of the following:
.Pp
.No *** MOUNT Em fstype from Li on Em on fsflags
.Pp
where
.Em fstype
is one of
.Em adosfs , afs , cd9660 , fdesc ,
.Em ffs , ext2fs , kernfs , lfs , lofs ,
.Em mfs , msdos , nfs , null ,
.Em procfs , umap , union ;
.Em from
is the filesystem mounted from;
.Em on
is the directory
the filesystem is mounted on; and
.Em fsflags
is a list
of optional flags applied to the mount (see
.Xr mount 8 ) .
The second line is a header for the individual fields,
the first part of which are fixed, and the second part are filesystem
type specific.
The headers common to all vnodes are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It ADDR
Location of this vnode.
.It TYP
File type.
.It VFLAG
A list of letters representing vnode flags:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It R
VROOT root of its file system.
.It T
VTEXT pure text prototype.
.It S

.It HOLD
The number of I/O buffers held by this vnode.
.It TAG
The type of underlying data.
.It NPAGE
The number of pages in this vnode.
.It FILEID
The vnode fileid.
In the case of
.Em ffs
or
.Em ext2fs
this is the inode number.
.It IFLAG
