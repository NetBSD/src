{NetBSD/@@MACHINE@@ @@VERSION@@

This menu-driven tool is designed to help you install NetBSD to a hard
disk, or upgrade an existing NetBSD system, with a minimum of work. 
In the following menus type the reference letter (a, b, c, ...) to
select an item, or type CTRL+N/CTRL+P to select the next/previous item. 
The arrow keys and Page-up/Page-down may also work. 
Activate the current selection from the menu by typing the enter key.

{Thank you for using NetBSD!
}

message installusure
{You have chosen to install NetBSD on your hard disk.  This will change
information on your hard disk.  You should have made a full backup
before this procedure!  This procedure will do the following things:
	a) Partition your disk
	b) Create new BSD file systems
	c) Load and install distribution sets
	d) Some initial system configuration

(After you enter the partition information but before your disk is
changed, you will have the opportunity to quit this procedure.)

`upgrade' if you want those options.)  You should have already done an
`install' or `upgrade' before starting this procedure!

to your choice, but aligned to cylinder boundaries.
Choosing sectors will allow you to more accurately specify
the sizes. On most disks, there is little to gain from
cylinder alignment.  On very old disks, it is most efficient
to choose partition sizes that are exact multiples of your actual
cylinder size.

If you select 'Use the entire disk' then the previous contents of the

entire disk. 
If you want to install more than one operating system then edit the

About $5 is enough for a basic installation, but you should allow
extra for additional software and user files. 
Allow at least $6 if you want to build NetBSD itself.}
