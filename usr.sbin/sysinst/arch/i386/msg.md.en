Note: since sysinst was able to uniquely match the disk you chose with a disk
known to the BIOS, the values displayed above are very likely correct, and
should not be changed (the values for cylinders, heads and sectors are
probably 1023, 255 and 63 - this is correct). 
You should only change the geometry if you know the BIOS reports incorrect
values.

However your system BIOS doesn't appear to support the read command used
