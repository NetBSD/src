{Installing boot blocks on %s....

message infoahdilabel
{You now have to prepare your root disk for the installation of NetBSD. This
is further referred to as 'labeling' a disk.

First you get the chance to edit or create an AHDI compatible partitioning on
the installation disk. Note that NetBSD can do without AHDI partitions,
check the documentation.
If you want to use an AHDI compatible partitioning, you have to assign some
partitions to NetBSD before NetBSD is able to use the disk. Change the 'id'
of all partitions you want to use for NetBSD file systems to 'NBD'. Change
the 'id' of the partition you wish to use for swap to 'SWP'.

Do you want AHDI compatible partitioning?
