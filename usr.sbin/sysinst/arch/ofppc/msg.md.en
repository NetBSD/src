{Choose disk: }

message partabovechs
{The NetBSD part of the disk lies outside of the range that the BIOS on
your machine can address. Booting from it may not be possible. Are you
sure you that you want to do this?

(Answering 'no' will take you back to the partition edit menu.)}

message set_kernel_1
{Kernel (GENERIC)}

message nobootpart
{There is no boot partition in the MBR partition table.}

message boottoosmall
{The FAT12 boot partition is too small.  It needs to be at least 2MB in size,
however a size of at least 10MB is recommended.}

message nobootpartdisklabel
{There is no boot partition in the disklabel.  The boot partition should
match the boot partition you set up in the MBR partition table.}

message preptoosmall
{You need to have two PReP partitions to boot an IBM RS/6000.  One needs to
be at least 1MB in size, and the other must be at least 1KB in size.}

message bootnotright
{In order to boot ofppc, you need either a FAT12 partition of at least 2MB
in size, or a pair of PReP partitions.  The PReP partitions need to be at
least 1KB, and 1MB in size.  IBM RS/6000 machines generally need the PReP
partitions, however some can utilize the FAT12.  Most other machines require
the FAT12 partition.  If you are not sure which to choose, accept the
defaults, and install all three.  You do not currently have any partitions
that meet the minimum requirements.}
