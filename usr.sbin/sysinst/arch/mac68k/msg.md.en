message mac68k_fullpart
{We are now going to install NetBSD on the disk %s.  You may
choose to install NetBSD on the entire disk or part of the disk.
Which would you like to do?
}

message nodiskmap
{It appears that your disk, %s, has not been formatted and initialized
for use on MacOS.  This program gets the disk layout of your disk by
reading the Disk Partition Map which is written by the disk formatter
when it prepared the disk for use with the Macintosh system.  Your
options are:

* Abort the install. You can format and define a preliminary
partition structure with any disk formatter.  Partitions do not
have to be defined as A/UX types; the NetBSD install process will
allow you to redefine them as necessary.

* Allow sysinst to initialize the Disk Partition Map for you. The
disk will not be MacOS bootable and may not be usable by MacOS unless
MacOS drivers are installed with a MacOS compatible disk formatter.

}

message okwritediskmap
{Sysinst will attempt to initialize your disk with a new Disk Partition
Map using values obtained from the disk driver.  This default Map will
include a minimal Block0 definition, a Partition Map allowing for up to
15 disk partitions, and pre-defined partitions for the Map, disk drivers,
and a minimal MacOS HFS partition. The rest of the disk will be marked
as available for use.  The disk driver partitions will not be initialized
so the volume will not be MacOS bootable.  If you choose to proceed from
this point with the installation you may edit this new partition map to
suit your NetBSD needs.  The Map will not be written to the disk until
you have completed your partition setups.

Shall we continue?}

message mac68k_ovrwrite
{Your disk currently has at least one MacOS HFS partition.  Overwriting
the entire disk will delete the partition and may make the disk unusable
under MacOS.  You should consider creating a single small MacOS HFS
partition to insure that the disk can be mounted under MacOS.  This
would be a good place to keep a copy of the NetBSD/mac68k Booter
application used to boot NetBSD from MacOS.

Are you really sure you want to overwrite the MacOS HFS partition(s)?

message split_part
{The disk partition you have selected will be split into two partitions.
One will be an Apple_Scratch type partition and the other an Apple_Free
type partition.  You may then change either of the partitions into one of
another type.  If the Apple_Free part is physically adjacent to another
partition which is also an Apple_Free type, the two will be automatically
merged into a single Apple_Free type partition.

There are %d disk blocks in the selected partition. Enter the number
of disk blocks you would like allocated to the Apple_Scratch partition.
Entering a value of zero, or a value greater than the number available
will leave the selected partition unchanged.

}

message scratch_size
{Size of the Apple_Scratch part of the split}

message diskfull
{You have tried to split an existing disk partition into two parts but
there is no room in the Disk Partition Map to map the second part. This
is probably because your disk formatter didn't reserve additional space
in the original Disk Partition Map for future modifications such as this.
Your options at this point are:

* Abandon any hope of splitting this partition, with the present
Disk Partition Map, or

* Allow sysinst to install a new Disk Map on your disk. This will
destroy all existing data on all partitions on the volume.  USE WITH CARE!

Would you like to Abandon splitting this partition?}

message label_error
{The new on-disk partition label does not match the one currently in-core.
Any attempt to proceed will most likely result in damage to any pre-existing
disk partitions. However your new Disk Partition Map has been written to
the disk and will be available the next time NetBSD is booted. Please
reboot immediately and restart the Installation Process.
