.It Li interface
Interface block commands (see below)
.It Li keepalive-time
Keepalive interval in seconds for established peers (default: 4s)
.It Li ldp-id
Force using a certain LDP Identificator (default autogenerated, highest INET4

interface re0 {
	transport-address 192.168.2.2
}

# Don't send hellos on en0
interface en0 {
	passive
}

# Force a certain LDP ID
ldp-id 10.5.1.1;

# Tag also the default route
no-default-route 0;
