.Sh NAME
.Nm ldpd
.Nd Label Distribution Protocol Daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl DdfhW
.Op Fl c Ar config_file
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a utility used to automatically distribute labels between two MPLS LSRs
conforming to RFC5036.
Currently some features described by RFC5036 are not fully implemented (see
.Sx BUGS
section).
.Nm
supports peering with IPv6 LDP speakers and IPv6 labels exchange, conforming
to specifications in RFC5036 and draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-ipv6.
.Pp
.Nm
logs information using the
.Xr syslog 3
interface.
You can increase the log verbosity using the
.Fl W
and
.Fl D
flags.
.Pp
Administrators can use
.Xr telnet 1
to connect to the control port (default: 2626) and use
this interface in order to get informations about protocol status,
neighbours et cetera but also to set runtime parameters.
The password required for connecting is the same as the root password.
.Pp
.Nm
computes existing routes and tries to match them on MPLS labels
announced by other LDP peers.
This means that usual IP
routes will be changed into tagged routes, and MPLS routing table
will be populated.
Any change in MPLS topology will also be announced to LDP neighbors.
.Nm
uses currently Independent Control Mapping and Downstream Unsolicited mode
for Label Advertisment.
.Nm
will listen on a route socket and compute the necessary changes in
order to change untagged routes into tagged routes.
This means that one may use one's favourite dynamic routing protocol
daemon without modifications.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 15n
.It Fl c Ar config_file
Specifies a path to the config file.
Default:
.Pa /etc/ldpd.conf
- see
.Xr ldpd.conf 5
for configuration file format.
.It Fl D
Enable debug mode.
.It Fl d
Don't use route interception code.
.Nm
will not make any changes to routing table if started with this option.
.It Fl f
Run in foreground.
Use STDOUT for warning and debug messages.
.It Fl h
Outputs supported flags.
.It Fl p Ar port
Changes the TCP control port (default: 2626).
.It Fl W
Enable output of warning messages.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Nx 6.0 .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
doesn't implement Path Vector and Hop Count TLVs.
.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
As a security measure you SHOULD filter the LDP well-known (646)
TCP and UDP ports using your favourite packet filter before starting
.Nm .
This is the current way used to filter neighbours and to protect the
system from possible external attacks like route injections.
