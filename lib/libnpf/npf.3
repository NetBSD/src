.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library provides an interface to create an NPF configuration having rules,
tables, procedures, or translation policies.
The configuration can be submitted to the kernel.
.\" -----
.Sh FUNCTIONS
.Ss Configuration
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fn npf_config_create
Create a configuration.
.It Fn npf_config_submit "ncf" "fd"
Submit configuration
.Fa ncf
to the kernel.
.It Fn npf_config_destroy "ncf"
Destroy the configuration
.Fa ncf .
.It Fn npf_config_flush "fd"
Flush the current configuration.
.El
.\" ---
.Ss Rule interface
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fn npf_rule_create "name" "attr" "if_idx"
Create a rule with a given name, attribute and priorty.
Name can be
.Dv NULL ,
in which case rule has no unique identifier.
Otherwise, rules shall not have duplicate names.
The following attributes, which can be ORed, are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Dv NPF_RULE_PASS
Decision of this rule is "pass".
If this attribute is not
specified, then packet "block" (drop) is the default.
.It Dv NPF_RULE_DEFAULT
This a default rule in the ruleset.
There can only be a
single rule having this attribute set in the ruleset.
.It Dv NPF_RULE_FINAL
Indicates that on rule match, further processing of the
ruleset should be stopped and this rule applied instantly.
.It Dv NPF_RULE_STATEFUL
Create a state (session) on match, track the connection and
therefore pass the backwards stream without inspection.
.It Dv NPF_RULE_RETRST
Return TCP RST packet in a case of packet block.
.It Dv NPF_RULE_RETICMP
Return ICMP destination unreachable in a case of packet block.
.It Dv NPF_RULE_IN
Rule may match only if incoming packet.
.It Dv NPF_RULE_OUT
Rule may match only if outgoing packet.
.El
.Pp
Interface is specified by
.Fa if_idx ,
which is a numeral representation of an
interface, given by
.Xr if_nametoindex 3 .
Zero indicates any interface.
.\" ---
.It Fn npf_rule_setcode "rl" "type" "code" "sz"
Assign compiled code for the rule specified by
.Fa rl ,
used for filter criteria.
Pointer to the binary code is specified by
.Fa code ,
and size of the memory area by
.Fa sz .
Type of the code is specified by
.Fa type .
Currently, only n-code is supported and
.Dv NPF_CODE_NCODE
should be passed.
.\" ---
.It Fn npf_rule_insert "ncf" "parent" "rl" "pri"
Insert the rule into the set of parent rule specified by
.Fa parent .
If value of
.Fa parent
is
.Dv NULL ,
then insert into the main ruleset.
.Pp
Priority is the order of the rule in the ruleset.
Lower value means first to process, higher value - last to process.
If multiple rules have the same priority - order is unspecified.
A special constant
.Dv NPF_PRI_NEXT
may be passed to use the value of last used priority incremented by 1.
.It Fn npf_rule_setproc "ncf" "rl" "name"
Set procedure for the specified rule.
.It Fn npf_rule_destroy "rl"
Destroy the given rule.
.El
.\" -----
.Ss Rule procedure interface
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fn npf_rproc_create "name"
Create a rule procedure with a given
.Fa name .
Name must be unique for each procedure.
.It Fn npf_rproc_insert "ncf" "rp"
Insert rule procedure into the specified configuration.
.El
.\" -----
.Ss Translation interface
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fn npf_nat_create "type" "flags" "if_idx" "addr" "af" "port"
Create a NAT translation policy of a specified type.
There are two types:
.Bl -tag -width "NPF_NAT_PORTMAP "
.It Dv NPF_NATIN
Inbound NAT policy.
.It Dv NPF_NATOUT
Outbound NAT policy.
.El
.Pp
A bi-directional NAT is obtained by combining two policies.
The following
.Fa flags
are supported:
.Bl -tag -width "NPF_NAT_PORTMAP "
.It Dv NPF_NAT_PORTS
Indicates to perform port translation.
Otherwise, port translation is not performed and
.Fa port
is ignored.
.It Dv NPF_NAT_PORTMAP
Effective only if
.Dv NPF_NAT_PORTS
flag is set.
Indicates to create a port map and select a random port for translation.
Otherwise, port is translated to the value specified by
.Fa port
is used.
.El
.Pp
Translation address is specified by
.Fa addr ,
and its family by
.Fa fa .
Family must be either
.Dv AF_INET
for IPv4 or
.Dv AF_INET6
for IPv6 address.
.It Fn npf_nat_insert "ncf" "nt" "pri"
Insert NAT policy, its rule, into the specified configuration.
.El
.\" -----
.Ss Table interface
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fn npf_table_create "index" "type"
Create NPF table of specified type.
The following types are supported:
.Bl -tag -width "NPF_TABLE_TREE "
.It Dv NPF_TABLE_HASH
Indicates to use hash table for storage.
.It Dv NPF_TABLE_TREE
Indicates to use red-black tree for storage.
Table is identified by
.Fa index ,
which should be in the range between 1 and
.Dv NPF_MAX_TABLE_ID .
.El
.It Fn npf_table_add_entry "tl" "addr" "mask"
Add an entry of IPv4 address and mask, specified by
.Fa addr
and
.Fa mask ,
to the table specified by
.Fa tl .
.It Fn npf_table_exists_p "ncf" "name"
Determine whether table with ID
.Fa tid
exists in the configuration
.Fa ncf .
Return
.Dv true
if exists, and
.Dv false
otherwise.
.It Fn npf_table_insert "ncf" "tl"
Insert table into set of configuration.
Routine performs a check for duplicate table ID.
.It Fn npf_table_destroy "tl"
Destroy the specified table.
.El
.\" -----
.Ss Session interface
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fn npf_update_rule "fd" "rname" "rl"
.It Fn npf_sessions_send "fd" "fpath"
Read the file specified by
.Fa fpath ,
and send sessions saved in it to the kernel.
.It Fn npf_sessions_recv "fd" "fpath"

specified by
.Fa fpath .
