.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library provides a lower-performance but smaller-size drop-in
replacement for the standard
.Xr malloc 3
family of functions provided by
.Lb libc ,
as well as internal hooks for
.Xr fork 2
safety in multithreaded programs.
.Pp
Programs can be statically linked with
.Li -lbsdmalloc
for smaller code footprint, at a higher cost to run-time performance
and scalability and limited diagnostics.

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr malloc 3 ,
.Xr posix_memalign 3
.\"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
.Sh BUGS
.Nm Ns No 's
implementation of
.Fn malloc ,
.Fn calloc ,
and
.Fn realloc
doesn't correctly set
.Xr errno 2
on failure.
