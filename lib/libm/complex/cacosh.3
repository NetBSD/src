.Sh NAME
.Nm cacosh ,
.Nm cacoshf ,
.Nm cacoshl
.Nd complex arc hyperbolic cosine functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In complex.h
.Ft double complex
.Fn cacosh "double complex z"
.Ft float complex
.Fn cacoshf "float complex z"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions compute the complex arc hyperbolic cosine of
.Ar z ,
with a branch cut at values less than 1 along the real axis.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return the complex arc hyperbolic cosine value,
in the range of a half-strip of non-negative values along
the real axis and in the interval [\-i pi,\ +i pi] along
the imaginary axis.
.Sh ERRORS
No errors are defined.
