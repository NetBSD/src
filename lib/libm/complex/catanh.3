.Sh NAME
.Nm catanh ,
.Nm catanhf ,
.Nm catanhl
.Nd complex arc hyperbolic tangent functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In complex.h
.Ft double complex
.Fn catanh "double complex z"
.Ft float complex
.Fn catanhf "float complex z"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions compute the complex arc hyperbolic tangent of
.Ar z ,
with branch cuts outside the interval
[\-1,\ +1] along the real axis.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return the complex arc hyperbolic tangent value,
in the range of a strip mathematically unbounded along
the real axis and in the interval [\-i pi/2,\ +i pi/2] along
the imaginary axis.
.Sh ERRORS
No errors are defined.
