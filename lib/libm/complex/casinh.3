.Sh NAME
.Nm casinh ,
.Nm casinhf ,
.Nm casinhl
.Nd complex arc hyperbolic sine functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In complex.h
.Ft double complex
.Fn casinh "double complex z"
.Ft float complex
.Fn casinhf "float complex z"
.Ft long double complex

.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions compute the complex arc hyperbolic sine of
.Ar z ,
with branch cuts outside the interval
[\-i,\ +i] along the imaginary axis.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return the complex arc hyperbolic sine value,
in the range of a strip mathematically unbounded along the
real axis and in the interval [\-i pi/2,\ +i pi/2] along
the imaginary axis.
.Sh ERRORS
No errors are defined.
