.Dt TANH 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm tanh ,
.Nm tanhf
.Nd hyperbolic tangent function
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In math.h
.Ft double
.Fn tanh "double x"
.Ft float
.Fn tanhf "float x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn tanh
and
.Fn tanhf
functions compute the hyperbolic tangent of
.Fa x .
For a discussion of error due to roundoff, see
.Xr math 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
these functions return the hyperbolic tangent value.
The following may also occur:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
If
.Fa x
is \*(Pm 0,
.Fa x
is returned.
.It
If
.Fa x
is \*(Na, a \*(Na is returned.
.It
If
.Fa x
is positive infinity, a value 1 is returned;
if
.Fa x
is negative infinity, -1 is returned.
.It
If
.Fa x
is subnormal, a range error can occur and
.Fa x
is returned.
