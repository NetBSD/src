/* ATAN(X)
 * RETURNS ARC TANGENT OF X
 * DOUBLE PRECISION (IEEE DOUBLE 53 bits, VAX D FORMAT 56 bits)
 * CODED IN C BY K.C. NG, 4/16/85, REVISED ON 6/10/85.
 *
 * Required kernel function:
 *	atan2(y,x)
 *
 * Method:
 *	atan(x) = atan2(x,1.0).
 *
 * Special case:
 *	if x is NaN, return x itself.
 *
 * Accuracy:
 * 1)  If atan2() uses machine PI, then
 *
 *	atan(x) returns (PI/pi) * (the exact arc tangent of x) nearly rounded;
 *	and PI is the exact pi rounded to machine precision (see atan2 for
 *      details):
 *
 *	in decimal:
 *		pi = 3.141592653589793 23846264338327 .....
 *    53 bits   PI = 3.141592653589793 115997963 ..... ,
 *    56 bits   PI = 3.141592653589793 227020265 ..... ,
 *
 *	in hexadecimal:
 *		pi = 3.243F6A8885A308D313198A2E....
 *    53 bits   PI = 3.243F6A8885A30  =  2 * 1.921FB54442D18	error=.276ulps
 *    56 bits   PI = 3.243F6A8885A308 =  4 * .C90FDAA22168C2    error=.206ulps
 *
 *	In a test run with more than 200,000 random arguments on a VAX, the
 *	maximum observed error in ulps (units in the last place) was
 *	0.86 ulps.      (comparing against (PI/pi)*(exact atan(x))).
 *
 * 2)  If atan2() uses true pi, then
 *
 *	atan(x) returns the exact atan(x) with error below about 2 ulps.
 *
 *	In a test run with more than 1,024,000 random arguments on a VAX, the
 *	maximum observed error in ulps (units in the last place) was
 *	0.85 ulps.
