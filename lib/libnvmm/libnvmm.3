.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
provides a library for VMM software to handle hardware-accelerated virtual
machines in
.Nx .
A virtual machine is described by an opaque structure,
.Cd nvmm_machine .
VMM software should not attempt to modify this structure directly, and should
use the API provided by
.Nm
to handle virtual machines.
.Pp
.Fn nvmm_capability
gets the capabilities of NVMM.
.Pp
.Fn nvmm_machine_create
creates a virtual machine in the kernel.
The
.Fa mach
structure is initialized, and describes the machine.
.Pp
.Fn nvmm_machine_destroy
destroys the virtual machine described in
.Fa mach .
.Pp
.Fn nvmm_machine_configure
configures, on the machine
.Fa mach ,
the parameter indicated in
.Fa op .
.Fa conf
describes the value of the parameter.
.Pp
.Fn nvmm_vcpu_create
creates a virtual CPU in the machine
.Fa mach ,
giving it the CPU id
.Fa cpuid .
.Pp
.Fn nvmm_vcpu_destroy
destroys the virtual CPU identified by
.Fa cpuid
in the machine
.Fa mach .
.Pp
.Fn nvmm_vcpu_getstate
gets the state of the virtual CPU identified by
.Fa cpuid
in the machine
.Fa mach .
The
.Fa state
argument is the address of a state area, and
.Fa flags
is the bitmap of the components that are to be retrieved.
See
.Sx VCPU State Area
below for details.
.Pp
.Fn nvmm_vcpu_setstate
sets the state of the virtual CPU identified by
.Fa cpuid
in the machine
.Fa mach .
The
.Fa state
argument is the address of a state area, and
.Fa flags
is the bitmap of the components that are to be set.
See
.Sx VCPU State Area
below for details.
.Pp
.Fn nvmm_vcpu_run
runs the CPU identified by
.Fa cpuid
in the machine
.Fa mach ,
until a VM exit is triggered.
The
.Fa exit
structure is filled to indicate the exit reason, and the associated parameters
if any.
.Pp
.Fn nvmm_gpa_map
makes the guest physical memory area beginning on address
.Fa gpa
and of size
.Fa size
available in the machine
.Fa mach .
The area is mapped in the calling process' virtual address space, at address
.Fa hva .
.Pp
.Fn nvmm_gpa_unmap
removes the guest physical memory area beginning on address
.Fa gpa
and of size
.Fa size
from the machine
.Fa mach .
It also unmaps the area beginning on
.Fa hva
from the calling process' virtual address space.
.Pp
.Fn nvmm_gva_to_gpa
translates, on the CPU
.Fa cpuid
from the machine
.Fa mach ,
the guest virtual address given in
.Fa gva
into a guest physical address returned in
.Fa gpa .
The associated page premissions are returned in
.Fa prot .
.Fa gva
must be page-aligned.
.Pp
.Fn nvmm_gpa_to_hva
translates, on the machine
.Fa mach ,
the guest physical address indicated in
.Fa gpa
into a host virtual address returned in
.Fa hva .
.Fa gpa
must be page-aligned.
.Pp
.Fn nvmm_assist_io
emulates the I/O operation described in
.Fa exit
on CPU
.Fa cpuid
from machine
.Fa mach .
.Fa cb
will be called to handle the transaction.
See
.Sx I/O Assist
below for details.
.Pp
.Fn nvmm_assist_mem
emulates the Mem operation described in
.Fa exit
on CPU
.Fa cpuid
from machine
.Fa mach .
.Fa cb
will be called to handle the transaction.
See
.Sx Mem Assist
below for details.
.Ss NVMM Capability
The
.Cd nvmm_capability
structure helps VMM software identify the capabilities offered by NVMM on the
host:
.Bd -literal
struct nvmm_capability {
	uint64_t version;
	uint64_t state_size;
	uint64_t max_machines;
	uint64_t max_vcpus;
	uint64_t max_ram;
	union {
		struct {
			...
		} x86;
		uint64_t rsvd[8];
	} u;
};
.Ed
.Pp
For example, the
.Cd max_machines
field indicates the maximum number of virtual machines supported, while
.Cd max_vcpus
indicates the maximum number of VCPUs supported per virtual machine.
.Ss VCPU State Area
A VCPU state area is a structure that entirely defines the content of the
registers of a VCPU.
Only one such structure exists, for x86:
.Bd -literal
struct nvmm_x64_state {
	...
};
.Ed
.Pp
Refer to functional examples to see precisely how to use this structure.
.Ss Exit Reasons
The
.Cd nvmm_exit
structure is used to handle VM exits:
.Bd -literal
enum nvmm_exit_reason {
	NVMM_EXIT_NONE		= 0x0000000000000000,

	/* General. */
	NVMM_EXIT_MEMORY	= 0x0000000000000001,
	NVMM_EXIT_IO		= 0x0000000000000002,
	NVMM_EXIT_MSR		= 0x0000000000000003,
	NVMM_EXIT_INT_READY	= 0x0000000000000004,
	NVMM_EXIT_NMI_READY	= 0x0000000000000005,
	NVMM_EXIT_SHUTDOWN	= 0x0000000000000006,

	/* Instructions (x86). */
	...

	NVMM_EXIT_INVALID	= 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
};

struct nvmm_exit {
	enum nvmm_exit_reason reason;
	union {
		...
	} u;
	uint64_t exitstate[8];
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Va reason
field indicates the reason of the VM exit.
Additional parameters describing the exit can be present in
.Va u .
.Va exitstate
contains a partial, implementation-specific VCPU state, usable as a fast-path
to retrieve certain state values.
.Pp
It is possible that a VM exit was caused by a reason internal to the host
kernel, and that VMM software should not be concerned with.
In this case, the exit reason is set to
.Cd NVMM_EXIT_NONE .
This gives a chance for VMM software to halt the VM in its tracks.
.Pp
Refer to functional examples to see precisely how to handle VM exits.
.Ss Event Injection
It is possible to inject an event into a VCPU.
An event can be a hardware interrupt, a software interrupt, or a software
exception, defined by:
.Bd -literal
enum nvmm_event_type {
	NVMM_EVENT_INTERRUPT_HW,
	NVMM_EVENT_INTERRUPT_SW,
	NVMM_EVENT_EXCEPTION
};

struct nvmm_event {
	enum nvmm_event_type type;
	uint64_t vector;
	union {
		uint64_t error;
		uint64_t prio;
	} u;
};
.Ed
.Pp
This describes an event of type
.Va type ,
to be sent to vector number
.Va vector ,
with a possible additional
.Va error
or
.Va prio
code that is implementation-specific.
.Pp
It is possible that the VCPU is in a state where it cannot receive this
event, if:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact
.It
the event is a hardware interrupt, and the VCPU runs with interrupts disabled,
or
.It
the event is a non-maskable interrupt (NMI), and the VCPU is already in a
in-NMI context.
.El
.Pp
In this case,
.Fn nvmm_vcpu_inject
will return
.Er EAGAIN ,
and NVMM will cause a VM exit with reason
.Cd NVMM_EXIT_INT_READY
or
.Cd NVMM_EXIT_NMI_READY
to indicate that VMM software can now reinject the desired event.
.Ss I/O Assist
When a VM exit occurs with reason
.Cd NVMM_EXIT_IO ,
it is necessary for VMM software to emulate the associated I/O operation.
.Nm
provides an easy way for VMM software to perform that.
.Pp
.Fn nvmm_assist_io
will call the
.Fa cb
callback function and give it a
.Cd nvmm_io
structure as argument.
This structure describes an I/O transaction:
.Bd -literal
struct nvmm_io {
	uint64_t port;
	bool in;
	size_t size;
	uint8_t data[8];
};
.Ed
.Pp
The callback can emulate the operation using this descriptor, following two
unique cases:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact
.It
The operation is an input.
In this case, the callback should fill
.Va data
with the desired value.
.It
The operation is an output.
In this case, the callback should read
.Va data
to retrieve the desired value.
.El
.Pp
In either case,
.Va port
will indicate the I/O port,
.Va in
will indicate if the operation is an input, and
.Va size
will indicate the size of the access.
.Ss Mem Assist
When a VM exit occurs with reason
.Cd NVMM_EXIT_MEMORY ,
it is necessary for VMM software to emulate the associated memory operation.
.Nm
provides an easy way for VMM software to perform that, similar to the I/O
Assist.
.Pp
.Fn nvmm_assist_mem
will call the
.Fa cb
callback function and give it a
.Cd nvmm_mem
structure as argument.
This structure describes a Mem transaction:
.Bd -literal
struct nvmm_mem {
	gvaddr_t gva;
	gpaddr_t gpa;
	bool write;
	size_t size;
	uint8_t data[8];
};
.Ed
.Pp
The callback can emulate the operation using this descriptor, following two
unique cases:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact
.It
The operation is a read.
In this case, the callback should fill
.Va data
with the desired value.
.It
The operation is a write.
In this case, the callback should read
.Va data
to retrieve the desired value.
.El
.Pp
In either case,
.Va gva
will indicate the guest virtual address,
.Va gpa
will indicate the guest physical address,
.Va write
will indicate if the access is a write, and
.Va size
will indicate the size of the access.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, each of these functions returns zero.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and the global
variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh FILES
Functional examples:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width XXXX -compact
.It Pa src/share/examples/nvmm/toyvirt/
Example of virtualizer.
Launches the binary given as argument in a virtual machine.
.It Pa src/share/examples/nvmm/smallkern/
Example of a kernel that can be executed by toyvirt.
.El
.Sh ERRORS
These functions will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width [ENOBUFS]
.It Bq Er EEXIST
An attempt was made to create a machine or a VCPU that already exists.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
An attempt was made to emulate a memory-based operation in a guest, and the
guest page tables did not have the permissions necessary for the operation
to complete successfully.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
An inappropriate parameter was used.
.It Bq Er ENOBUFS
The maximum number of machines or VCPUs was reached.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
A query was made on a machine or a VCPU that does not exist.
.It Bq Er EPERM
An attempt was made to access a machine that does not belong to the process.
.El
.Pp
In addition,
.Fn nvmm_vcpu_inject
uses the following error codes:
.Bl -tag -width [ENOBUFS]
.It Bq Er EAGAIN
The VCPU cannot receive the event immediately.
.El
