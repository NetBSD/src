.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm perfuse_mount ,
.Nm perfuse_open
.Nd Request a
.Xr puffs 3
mount from
.Xr perfused 8
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libperfuse
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In perfuse.h
.Ft int
.Fn perfuse_mount "const char *source" "const char *dir" "const char *filesystemtype" "long int mountflags" "void *data"
.Ft int
.Fn perfuse_open "const char *path" "int flags"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn perfuse_mount
sends a mount request to
.Xr perfused 8 .
It is intended as a drop-in replacement for
.Xr mount 2
for FUSE file systems daemons and libraries, so that they can work with
.Xr perfused 8 .
.Pp
The function prototype mimics Linux's
.Xr mount 2 ,
with the following arguments:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar source
The source file system that will appear in
.Xr df 1
and
.Xr mount 8
listings.
Defaults to
.Pa /dev/fuse
if
.Dv NULL .
.It Ar dir
The file system mount point.
.It Ar filesystemtype
The file system type, as displayed by
.Xr df 1
and
.Xr mount 8 .
Defaults to
.Dq fuse
if
.Dv NULL .
.It Ar mountflags
This contains the same value as a
.Xr mount 2
.Ar flags
argument.
.It Ar data
This contains the same value as a
.Xr mount 2
.Ar data
argument.
.El
.Pp
.Fn perfuse_open
is a drop-in replacement for the
.Xr open 2
system call where
.Pa /dev/fuse
is used.
If
.Ar path
is different than
.Pa /dev/fuse ,
.Fn perfuse_open
handles control to the regular
.Xr open 2 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn perfuse_mount
returns a file descriptor to the
.Pa /dev/fuse
socket on success, and causes exit on failure.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Ev PERFUSE_OPTIONS
Comma-separated values controlling the usage of some FUSE methods.
Allowed values are
.Li enable_access ,
.Li disable_access ,
.Li enable_creat ,
.Li disable_creat .
.It Ev PERFUSE_BUFSIZE
Set the socket buffer sizes used for communication with the filesystem.
This should be raised as operation throughput requires it.
Default is
.Li 2162688
bytes, which is enough to queue 16 FUSE packets of maximum 132 kB length.
