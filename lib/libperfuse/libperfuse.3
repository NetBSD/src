.Sh NAME
.Nm perfuse_mount ,
.Nm perfuse_open
.Nd Request a
.Xr puffs 3 mount from 
.Xr perfused 8 .
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libperfuse
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In perfuse.h
.Ft int
.Fn perfuse_mount "const char *source" "const char *dir" "const char *filesystemtype" "long int mountflags" "void *data"
.Ft int
.Fn perfuse_open "const char *path" "int flags"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn perfuse_mount
sends a mount request to 
.Xr perfused 8 .
It is intended as a drop-in replacement for
.Xr mount 2
for FUSE filesystems daemons and libraries, so that they can work with
.Xr perfused 8 .
.Pp
The function prototype mimics Linux's
.Xr mount 2 ,
with the following arguments:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar source
The source fileystem that will appear in
.Xr df 1 ,
and
.Xr mount 8
listings. Defaults to
.Pa /dev/fuse
if NULL.
.It Ar dir
The filesystem mount point.
.It Ar filesystemtype
The gileystem type, as displayed by
.Xr df 1 ,
and
.Xr mount 8 .
Defaults to "fuse"
if NULL.
.It Ar mountflags
This contains the same value as in 
.Xr mount 2
.Ar flags
argument.
.It Ar data
This contains the same value as in 
.Xr mount 2
.Ar data
argument.
.El
.Pp
.Fn perfuse_open
is a drop-in replacement for the 
.Xr open 2
system call where
.Pa /dev/fuse
is used. If
.Ar path
is different than
.Pa /dev/fuse ,
.Fn perfuse_open 
handles control to the regular
.Xr open 2 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn perfuse_mount
returns a file descriptor to the
.Pa /dev/fuse
socket on success, and cause exit on failure.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn perfuse_mount
will fail when one of the following occurs:
.Bl -tag -width Er
