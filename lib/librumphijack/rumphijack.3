.Dt RUMPHIJACK 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rumphijack
.Nd System call hijack library
.Sh LIBRARY
used by
.Xr ld.so 1
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr ld.so 1
runtime linker can be instructed to load
.Nm
between the main object and other libraries.
This enables
.Nm
to capture and redirect system call requests to a rump kernel instead
of the host kernel.
.Pp
The behaviour of hijacked applications is affected by the following
environment variables:
.Bl -tag -width 12345
.It Dv RUMPHIJACK_RETRYCONNECT
Change how
.Xr rumpclient 3
attempts to reconnect to the server in case the connection is lost.
Acceptable values are:
.Bl -tag -width xxinftimexx
.It Dq inftime
retry indefinitely
.It Dq once
retry once, when that connection fails, give up
.It Dq die
call
.Xr exit 3
if connection failure is detected
.It n
Attempt reconnect for n seconds.
The value 0 means reconnection is not attempted.
The value n must be a positive integer.
.El
.Pp
See
.Xr rumpclient 3
for more discussion.
.El
.Pp
Currently
.Nm
supports only TCP/IP related system calls.
The set of supported subsystems may change later along with the usage
of the library.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Use an alternate TCP/IP stack for firefox with a persistent server
connection:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ setenv RUMP_SERVER unix:///tmp/tcpip
$ setenv LD_PRELOAD /usr/lib/librumphijack.so
$ setenv RUMPHIJACK_RETRYCONNECT inftime
$ firefox
