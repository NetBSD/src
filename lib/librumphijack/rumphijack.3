.Sh NAME
.Nm rumphijack
.Nd System call hijack library
.Sh LIBRARY
used by
.Xr ld.so 1
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr ld.so 1
runtime linker can be instructed to load
.Nm
between the main object and other libraries.
This enables
.Nm
to capture and redirect system call requests to a rump kernel instead
of the host kernel.
.Pp
Currently
.Nm
supports only TCP/IP related system calls.
The set of supported subsystems may change later along with the usage
of the library.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Use an alternate TCP/IP stack for firefox:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ setenv RUMP_SERVER unix:///tmp/tcpip
$ setenv LD_PRELOAD /usr/lib/librumphijack.so
$ firefox
