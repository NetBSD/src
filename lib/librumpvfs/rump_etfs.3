.Sh DESCRIPTION
The rump ExtraTerrestrial File System
.Nm ( )
is used to provide access to the host file system namespace
within a rump kernel.
.Pp
The operation is based on registered
.Fa key
values which each map to a
.Fa hostpath .
A key must be an absolute path (i.e. begin with
.Dq / ) .
Multiple leading slashes are collapsed to one (i.e.
.Dq /key
is the same as
.Dq //key ) .
The rest of the path, including slashes, is compared verbatim (i.e.
.Dq /key/path
does not match
.Dq /key//path ) .
.Pp
The
.Fa hostpath
is interpreted in host system context for the current working directory
and can be either absolute or relative.
.Pp
The
.Fa key
is accessible from all rump kernel clients, both local and remote.
Note, the keys are not be visible via readdir, so you will not see
them in directory listings.
.Pp
The
.Fa ftype
parameter specifies how etfs file will be presented and does not
have to match the host type, although some limitations apply.
Possible values are:
.Bl -tag -width RUMP_ETFS_DIR_SUBDIRSXXX
.It Dv RUMP_ETFS_REG
regular file.
.It Dv RUMP_ETFS_BLK
block device.
This is often used when mapping file system images.
.It Dv RUMP_ETFS_CHR
character device.
.It Dv RUMP_ETFS_DIR
directory.
This option is valid only when
.Fa hostpath
is a directory.
The immediate children of the host directory will be accessible
inside a rump kernel.
.It Dv RUMP_ETFS_DIR_SUBDIRS
directory.
This option is valid only when
.Fa hostpath
is a directory.
This option recursively applies to all subdirectories, and allows
a rump kernel to access an entire directory tree.
.El
.Pp
The interfaces are:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Fn rump_pub_etfs_register "key" "hostpath" "ftype"
Map
.Fa key
to a file of type
.Fa ftype
with the contents of
.Fa hostpath .
.It Fn rump_pub_etfs_register_withsize "key" "hostpath" "ftype" "begin" "size"
Like the above, but map only
.Fa [ begin , begin+size ]
from
.Fa hostpath .
This is useful when mapping disk images where only one partition is
relevant to the application.
If
.Ar size
is given the special value
.Dv RUMP_ETFS_SIZE_ENDOFF ,
the underlying file is mapped from
.Ar begin
to the end of the file.
.It Fn rump_pub_etfs_remove "key"
Remove etfs mapping for
.Fa key .
This routine may be called only if the file related to the mapping
is not in use.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Map a host image file to a mountable
.Pa /dev/harddisk
path using window offsets from the disklabel.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
rump_pub_etfs_register_withsize("/dev/harddisk", "disk.img",
    RUMP_ETFS_BLK,
    pp->p_offset << DEV_BSHIFT, pp->p_size << DEV_BSHIFT);
.Ed
.Pp
Make the host kernel module directory hierarchy available within the
rump kernel.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
rump_pub_etfs_register("/stand/i386/5.99.41",
    "/stand/i386/5.99.41", RUMP_ETFS_DIR_SUBDIRS);
