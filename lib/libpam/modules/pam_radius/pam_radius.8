.Sh NAME
.Nm pam_radius
.Nd RADIUS PAM module
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Op Ar service-name
.Ar module-type
.Ar control-flag
.Pa pam_radius
.Op Ar options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The RADIUS service module for PAM
provides authentication services based
upon the RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial In User Service) protocol.
.Pp
The
.Nm
module accepts these optional parameters:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Cm use_first_pass
causes
.Nm
to use a previously entered password instead of prompting for a new one.
If no password has been entered then authentication fails.
.It Cm try_first_pass
causes
.Nm
to use a previously entered password, if one is available.
If no
password has been entered,
.Nm
prompts for one as usual.
.It Cm echo_pass
causes echoing to be left on if
.Nm
prompts for a password.
.It Cm conf Ns = Ns Ar pathname
specifies a non-standard location for the RADIUS client configuration file
(normally located in
.Pa /etc/radius.conf ) .
.It Cm nas_id Ns = Ns Ar identifier
specifies a NAS identifier to send instead of the hostname.
.It Cm template_user Ns = Ns Ar username
specifies a user whose
.Xr passwd 5
entry will be used as a template to create the session environment
if the supplied username does not exist in the local password database.
The user
will be authenticated with the supplied username and password, but his
credentials to the system will be presented as the ones for
.Ar username ,
i.e., his login class, home directory, resource limits, etc.\& will be set to ones
defined for
.Ar username .
.Pp
If this option is omitted, and there is no username
in the system databases equal to the supplied one (as determined by call to
.Xr getpwnam 3 ) ,
the authentication will fail.
.It Cm nas_ipaddr Ns Op No = Ns Ar address
specifies a NAS IP address to be sent.
If option is present, but there is no value provided then IP address
corresponding to the current hostname will be used.
