.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library provides routines for accessing
.Nx Ns 's
one-time password (OTP) authentication system.
.Pp
Most S/Key operations take a pointer to a
.Em struct skey ,
which should be considered as an opaque identifier.
.Sh FUNCTIONS
The following high-level functions are available:
.Bl -tag -width compact
.It Fn skeychallenge "mp" "name" "ss" "sslen"
Return a S/Key challenge for user
.Fa name .
If successful, the caller's skey structure
.Fa mp
is filled and 0 is returned.  If unsuccessful (e.g. if name is unknown),
-1 is returned.
.It Fn skeylookup "mp" "name"
Find an entry for user
.Fa name
in the one-time password database.  Returns 0 if the entry is found
and 1 if the entry is not found.  If an error occurs accessing the
database, -1 is returned.
.It Fn skeygetnext "mp"
Get the next entry in the one-time password database.  Returns 0 on
success and the entry is stored in
.Ar mp
and 1 if no more entries are available.  If an error occurs accessing
the database, -1 is returned.
.It Fn skeyverify "mp" "response"
Verify response
.Fa response
to a S/Key challenge.  Returns 0 if the verification is successful and
1 if the verification failed.  If an error occurs accessing the
database, -1 is returned.
.It Fn skeyzero "mp" "response"
Comment out user's entry in the S/Key database.  Returns 0 on success
and the database is updated, otherwise -1 is returned and the database
remains unchanged.
.It Fn getskeyprompt "mp" "name" "prompt"
Issue a S/Key challenge for user
.Ar name .
If successful, fill in the caller's skey structure
.Fa mp
and return 0.  If unsuccessful (e.g. if name is unknown) -1 is returned.
.El
.Pp
The following lower-level functions are available:
.Bl -tag -width compact
.It Fn skey_set_algorithm "new"
Set hash algorithm type.  Valid values for
.Fa new
are "md4", "md5" and "sha1".
.It Fn skey_get_algorithm "void"
Get current hash type.
.It Fn skey_haskey "username"
Returns 0 if the user
.Fa username
exists and 1 if the user doesn't exist.  Returns -1 on file error.
.It Fn skey_keyinfo "username"
Returns the current sequence number and seed for user
.Ar username .
.It Fn skey_passcheck "username" "passwd"
Check to see if answer is the correct one to the current challenge.
.It Fn skey_authenticate "username"
Used when calling program will allow input of the user's repsonse to
the challenge.  Returns zero on success or -1 on failure.
.El
.Pp
The following miscellaneous functions are available:
.Bl -tag -width compact
.It Fn f "x"
One-way function to take 8 bytes pointed to by
.Fa x
and return 8 bytes in place.
.It Fn keycrunch "char *result" "const char *seed" "const char *passwd"
Crunch a key.
.It Fn rip "buf"
Strip trailing CR/LF characters from a line of text
.Fa buf .
.It Fn readpass "buf" "n"
Read in secret passwd (turns off echo).
.It Fn readskey "buf" "n"
Read in an s/key OTP (does not turn off echo).
.It Fn atob8 "out" "in"
Convert 8-byte hex-ascii string
.Fa in
to binary array
.Fa out .
Returns 0 on success, -1 on error.
.It Fn btoa8 "out" "in"
Convert 8-byte binary array
.Fa in
to hex-ascii string
.Fa out .
Returns 0 on success, -1 on error.
.It Fn htoi "int c"
Convert hex digit to binary integer.
.It Fn skipspace "cp"
Skip leading spaces from the string
.Fa cp .
.It Fn backspace "buf"
Remove backspaced over characters from the string
.Fa buf .
.It Fn sevenbit "buf"
Ensure line
.Fa buf
is all seven bits.
.It Fn btoe "engout" "c"
Encode 8 bytes in
.Ar c
as a string of English words.  Returns a pointer to a static buffer in
.Fa engout .
.It Fn etob "out" "e"
Convert English to binary.  Returns 0 if the word is not in the
database, 1 if all good words and parity is valid, -1 if badly formed
input (i.e. \*[Gt] 4 char word) and -2 if words are valid but parity is
wrong.
.It Fn put8 "out" "s"
Display 8 bytes
.Fa s
as a series of 16-bit hex digits.

.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
library functions are not re-entrant or thread-safe.
.Pp
The
.Nm
library defines many poorly named functions which pollute the name
space.
