.Sh NAME
.Nm form
.Nd form library
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libform
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include \*[Lt]form.h\*[Gt]
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library provides a terminal independent form system using the
.Xr curses 3
library.  Before using the
.Nm
functions the terminal must be set up by
.Xr curses 3
using the
.Fn initscr
function or similar.  Programs using
.Nm
functions must be linked with the
.Xr curses 3
library
.Fl lcurses .
.Pp
The
.Nm
library provides facilities for defining form fields, placing a form on the
terminal screen, assign pre and post change operations and setting the
attributes of both the form and its fields.
.Ss Defining default attributes for forms and fields
The
.Nm
library allows any settable attribute or option of both the form and field
objects to be defined such that any new form or field automatically inherits
the value as default.  Setting the default value will not affect any field or
form that has already been created but will be applied to subsequent objects.
To set the default attribute or option the set routine is passed a NULL
pointer in the field or form parameter when calling the set routine.  The
current default value can be retrieved by calling the get routine with a
NULL pointer for the field or form parameter.

.Sh RETURN VALUES
Any function returning a string pointer will return NULL if an error
occurs.  Functions returning an integer will return one of the
following:
.Pp
.ta 20
.nf
E_OK			The function was successful
E_SYSTEM_ERROR		There was a system error during the call.
E_BAD_ARGUMENT		One or more of the arguments passed to the function
			was incorrect.
E_POSTED		The form is already posted.
E_CONNECTED		An field was already connected to a form.
E_BAD_STATE		The function was called from within an initialisation
			or termination routine.
E_NO_ROOM		The form does not fit within the subwindow.
E_NOT_POSTED		The form is not posted
E_UNKNOWN_COMMAND	The form driver does not recognise the request
			passed to it.
E_NOT_SELECTABLE	The field could not be selected.
E_NOT_CONNECTED		The field is not connected to a form.
E_REQUEST_DENIED	The form driver could not process the request.
E_INVALID_FIELD		The field is invalid.
E_CURRENT		The field is the active one on the form.

.Sh NOTES
This implementation of the forms library does depart in behaviour
subtly from the original AT \*[Am] T implementation.  Some of the more
notable departures are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "circular fields" -compact
.It field wrapping
For multiline fields the data will be wrapped as it is entered, this
does not happen in the AT\*[Am]T implementation.
.It buffer 0
In this implementation, the contents of buffer 0 are always current
regardless of whether the field has been validated or not.
.It circular fields
In the AT\*[Am]T implementation fields are circular on a page, that is, a
next field from the last field will go to the first field on the
curent page.  In this implementation a next field request on the last
field of a page will result in the forms library positioning the
cursor on the first field of the next page.  If the field is the last
field in the form then going to the next field will be denied, in the
AT\*[Am]T it would result in the cursor being placed on the first field of
the first page.
.It buffer returns
In this implementation only the data entered by the user in the form
field will be returned, unlike the AT\*[Am]T library which would return the
contents of the field padded to the size of the field with the pad
character.
