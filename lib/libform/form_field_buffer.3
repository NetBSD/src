.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <form.h>
.Ft char *
.Fn field_buffer "FIELD *field, int buffer"
.Ft int
.Fn field_status "FIELD *field"
.Ft int
.Fn set_field_buffer "FIELD *field, int buffer, char *value"
.Ft int
.Fn set_field_status "FIELD *field, int status"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Fn field_buffer
function returns the contents of the buffer number specified by
.Fa buffer
for the given field.  If the requested buffer number exceeds the
number of buffers attached to the field then NULL will be returned.
The field buffer may be set by calling
.Fn set_field_buffer
which will set the given buffer number to the contents of the string
passed.  Calling 
.Fn field_status
will return the status of the first buffer attached to the field.  If
the field has been modified then the function will return TRUE
otherwise FALSE is returned, the status of the first buffer may be
programmatically set by calling 
.Fn set_field_status .
The maximum growth of a dynamic field can be set by calling
.Fn set_max_field
which limits the fields rows if the field is a multiline field or the
fields columns if the field only has a single row.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Functions returning pointers will return NULL if an error is detected.
The functions that return an int will return one of the following error
values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width E_UNKNOWN_COMMAND -compact
.It Er E_OK
The function was successful.
.It Er E_BAD_ARGUMENT
A bad parameter was passed to the function.
.It Er E_SYSTEM_ERROR
A system error occurred performing the function.
