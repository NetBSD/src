.Dt TD_THR_INFO 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm td_thr_info
.Nd get information on a thread
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libpthread_dbg
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In pthread_dbg.h
.Ft int
.Fn td_thr_info "td_thread_t *thread" "td_thread_info_t *info"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn td_thr_info
function retrieves information on a thread specified in the
.Fa thread
argument and saves the result in
.Fa info .
.Pp
The following members are defined in the
.Dv td_thread_info_t
structure:
.Bl -column "thread_state" "caddr_t" "Pointer to underlaying Dv pthread_t object"
.It Sy Name      Ta Sy Type     Ta Sy Description
.It thread_addr  Ta Dv caddr_t  Ta Points to underlaying Dv pthread_t object
.It thread_state Ta Dv int      Ta Defines Dv TD_STATE of the thread
.\" TODO: Add ATF tests, verify and document:
.\" thread_type
.\" thread_id
.\" thread_stack
.\" thread_hasjoiners
.\" thread_tls
.\" thread_errno
.\" thread_sigmask
.\" thread_sigpending
.El
.Ss Thread State types
The following state types are possible in
.Dv thread_state :
.Pp
.Bl -column ".Sy TD_STATE_RUNNING" "Thread is alive" -compact
.It Dv TD_STATE_UNKNOWN Ta "Unknown state"
.It Dv TD_STATE_RUNNING Ta "Thread is alive"
.It Dv TD_STATE_ZOMBIE  Ta "Thread is in the zombie state"
.It Dv TD_STATE_DEAD    Ta "Thread is dead"
.El
.Pp
It is not possible to retrieve information whether a thread
is suspended or resumed using this interface,
as this data is stored only inside the kernel and not in the
.Dv pthread_t
object.
The
.Dv TD_STATE_RUNNING
name is kept for backwards compatibility with old Scheduler Activation threads.
The
.Dv TD_STATE_RUNNING
state might only be returned for a mismatch between the versions of
.Xr pthread 3
and
.Xr pthread_dbg 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, the
.Nm
function will return
.Dv TD_ERR_OK .
Otherwise an error number will be returned to indicate failure as described in
.Xr pthread_dbg 3 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr pthread 3 ,
.Xr pthread_dbg 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
function first appeared in
.Nx 2.0 .
