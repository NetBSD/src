.Sh NAME
.Nm post_menu
.Nd menu library
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libmenu
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <menu.h>
.Ft int
.Fn post_menu "MENU *menu"
.Ft int
.Fn unpost_menu "MENU *menu"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn post_menu
function causes the menu to be drawn on the screen.  Any functions
defined by either 
.Xr set_menu_init
or
.Xr set_item_init
are called before the menu is placed on the screen.  The 
.Fn unpost_menu
does the opposite, it removes a menu from the screen.  Any functions
defined by both
.Xr set_menu_term
and
.Xr set_item_term
are called prior to the menu's removal.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The functions return one of the following error values:
.Pp
.ta 20
.nf
E_OK			The function was successful
E_SYSTEM_ERROR		There was a system error during the call.
E_BAD_ARGUMENT		One or more of the arguments passed to the function
			was incorrect.
E_POSTED		The menu is already posted.
E_BAD_STATE		The function was called from within an initialisation
			or termination routine.
E_NO_ROOM		The menu does not fit within the subwindow.
E_NOT_CONNECTED		The item is not connected to a menu.
