.Sh NAME
.Nm update_panels
.Nd update terminal display
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libpanel
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In panel.h
.\"
.Ft void
.Fn update_panels "void"
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn update_panels
function performs the internal processing required by the panel
library to determine what changes need to be made to synchronise
the curses internal screen buffer and the terminal but does not
modify the terminal display.
.Pp
This function will internally perform the required calls to
.Xr touchoverlap 3
and
.Xr wnoutrefresh 3
in the correct order.
You should never directly call curses functions like
.Xr wnoutrefresh 3
on panel windows yourself.
Remember, that
.Dv stdscr
is below all panels and any changes to it also require calling
.Fn update_panels .
.Pp
Finally, call the curses function
.Xr doupdate 3
to update the terminal display.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr doupdate 3 ,
.Xr panel 3
