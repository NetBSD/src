.Sh NAME
.Nm update_panels
.Nd update terminal display
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libpanel
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In panel.h
.\"
.Ft void
.Fn update_panels "void"
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn update_panels
function performs the internal processing required by the panel
library to determine what changes need to be made to synchronise
curses internal screen buffer and the terminal but does not modify the
terminal display.
.Pp
This function will inernally perform required calls to
.Xr touchoverlap 3
and
.Xr wnoutrefresh 3
in the correct order.
You should never directly call curses functions like
.Xr wnoutrefresh 3
on panel windows yourself.
Remember, that
.Dv stdscr
is below all panels and any changes to it also require calling
.Fn update_panels .
.Pp
Finally, call curses function
.Xr doupdate 3
to update the terminal display.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr doupdate 3 ,
.Xr panel 3
