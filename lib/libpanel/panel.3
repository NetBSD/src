.Dt PANEL 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm panel
.Nd z-order for curses windows
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libpanel
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In panel.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Overlapping curses windows have no notion of z-order,
what you see on the screen depends on the order of updates.
.Nm
library is an extension built on top of
.Xr curses(3)
that adds z-order to curses windows.
.Pp
Each panel has an associated curses window.
All currently visible panels form a
.Dq deck .
Panels have z-order only relative to other panels in the deck and to
.Xr stdscr(3) .
The latter doesn't have a panel of its own but implicitly lies below
all other panels in the deck.
If you mix plain curses windows and panels the visual results are
undefined since panel library is not aware of windows that are not
associated with panels.
