.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In curses.h
.Ft bool
.Fn has_mouse "void"
.Ft int
.Fn getmouse "MEVENT *event"
.Ft int
.Fn ungetmouse "MEVENT *event"
.Ft mmask_t
.Fn mousemask "mmask_t newmask" "mmask_t *oldmask"
.Ft bool
.Fn wenclose "const WINDOW *win" "int y" "int x"
.Ft bool
.Fn mouse_trafo "int *y" "int *x" "bool to_screen"
.Ft bool
.Fn wmouse_trafo "const WINDOW *win" "int *y" "int *x" "bool to_screen"
.Ft int
.Fn mouseinterval "int erval"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This is the curses interface to mouse events.
Mouse events are reported via the
.Dv KEY_MOUSE
value in the
.Xr wgetch 3
input stream.
.Pp
The
.Fn has_mouse
function returns true if the mouse support has been initialised for the
terminal, otherwise false.
.Pp
The
.Fn getmouse
function reads a mouse event.
The
.Fa x
and
.Fa y
values are screen relative and the state mask will have exactly one bit set
to represent the event type.
The
.Fn ungetmouse
function behave like
.Xr ungetch 3
and pushes the mouse event into the input stream.
.Pp
The
.Fn mousemask
function sets the mouse events to be reported.
By default, there are no mouse events reported.
It returns a mask indicating which of the specified mouse events can be
reported, zero indicating a failure.
If oldmask is given, it is filled with the previous mouse event mask.
.Pp
The
.Fn wenclose
function returns true if the screen relative
.Fa x
and
.Fa y
co-ordinates are enclosed by the window
.Fa win ,
otherwise false.
.Pp
The
.Fn wmouse_trafo
function transforms the
.Fa x
and
.Fa y
co-ordinates from screen relative to window relative or vice versa
depending on the value of
.Fa to_screen .
If the co-ordinates are not enclosed by the window
.Fa win
then false is returned, otherwise the
.Fa x
and
.Fa y
values are transformed and true is returned.
The
.Fn mouse_trainfo
function calls
.Fn wmouse_trainfo
using
.Va stdscr
for
.Fa win .
.Pp
The
.Fn mouseinterval
function sets the maximum time that can elapse between press and release
events, which determins a click.
The value is in thousands of seconds.
The default value is one fifth of a second.
The returned value is the old value.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Unless otherwise noted, the functions that return an int will return one of
the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ERR -compact
.It Er OK
The function completed successfully.
.It Er ERR
An error occurred in the function.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr wsmouse 4
.Sh STANDARDS
These functions are ncurses extensions to the Curses library.
.Sh HISTORY
The mouse functions were added in
.Nx 10.0 .
.Sh BUGS
There is currently no actual mouse support,
.Fn has_mouse
will always return false.
