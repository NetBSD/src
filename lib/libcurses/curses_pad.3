.Ft bool
.Fn is_pad "const WINDOW *pad"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions create and display pads on the current screen.
.Pp
The
.Fn newpad
function creates a new pad of size
.Fa lines ,
.Fa cols .
.Pp
.Fn subpad
is similar to
.Fn newpad
excepting that the size of the subpad is bounded by the parent
pad
.Fa pad .
The subpad shares internal data structures with the parent pad
and will be refreshed when the parent pad is refreshed.
The starting column and row
.Fa begin_y ,
.Fa begin_x
are relative to the parent pad origin.
.Pp
The
.Fn pnoutrefresh
function performs the internal processing required by curses to determine
what changes need to be made to synchronise the internal screen buffer
and the terminal but does not modify the terminal display.
A rectangular area of the pad starting at column and row
.Fa pbeg_y ,
.Fa pbeg_x
is copied to the corresponding rectangular area of the screen buffer starting
at column and row
.Fa sbeg_y ,
.Fa sbeg_x
and extending to
.Fa smax_y ,
.Fa smax_x .
.Pp
The
.Fn prefresh
function causes curses to propagate changes made to the pad specified by
.Fa pad
to the terminal display.
A rectangular area of the pad starting at column and row
.Fa pbeg_y ,
.Fa pbeg_x
is copied to the corresponding rectangular area of the terminal starting
at column and row
.Fa sbeg_y ,
.Fa sbeg_x
and extending to
.Fa smax_y ,
.Fa smax_x .
.Pp
The
.Fn pnoutrefresh
and
.Fn doupdate
functions can be used together to speed up terminal redraws by
deferring the actual terminal updates until after a batch of updates
to multiple pads has been done.
.Pp
The
.Fn is_pad
function returns true if the given window was created by
.Fn newpad ,
otherwise false.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Functions returning pointers will return
.Dv NULL
if an error is detected.
The functions that return an int will return one of the following
values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ERR -compact
.It Er OK
The function completed successfully.
.It Er ERR
An error occurred in the function.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr curses_refresh 3 ,
.Xr curses_window 3
.Sh NOTES
The
.Fn subpad
function is similar to the
.Xr derwin 3
function, and not the
.Xr subwin 3
function.
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nx
Curses library complies with the X/Open Curses specification, part of the
Single Unix Specification.
.Sh HISTORY
The Curses package appeared in
.Bx 4.0 .
The
.Fn is_pad
function is a
.Em ncurses
extension to the Curses library and was added in
.Nx 8.0 .
