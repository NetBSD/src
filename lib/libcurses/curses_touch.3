.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include \*[Lt]curses.h\*[Gt]
.Ft int
.Fn touchline "WINDOW *win" "int row" "int start" "int end"
.Ft int
.Fn touchoverlap "WINDOW *win1" "WINDOW *win2"
.Ft int
.Fn touchwin "WINDOW *win"
.Ft int
.Fn untouchwin "WINDOW *win"
.Ft int
.Fn wtouchln "WINDOW *win" "int line" "int n" "boolf changed"
.Ft bool
.Fn is_linetouched "WINDOW *win" "int line"
.Ft bool
.Fn is_wintouched "WINDOW *win"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions mark lines and windows as modified and check the modification
status of lines and windows.
.Pp
The
.Fn touchline
function marks the characters from
.Fa start
to
.Fa end
on row
.Fa row
in window
.Fa win
as having been modified.
These characters will be synced to the terminal on the next call to
.Fn wrefresh .
.Pp
The
.Fn touchoverlap
function marks the portion of
.Fa win2
that overlaps
.Fa win1
as being modified.
.Pp
The
.Fn touchwin
function marks the entire window
.Fa win
as having been modified.
Conversely,
the
.Fn untouchwin
function marks the window
.Fa win
as being unmodified, so that any changes made to that window will
not be synced to the terminal during a
.Fn wrefresh .
.Pp
The
.Fn wtouchln
function performs one of two operations on
.Fa n
lines starting at
.Fa line
in the given window.
If
.Fa changed
is 1 then the given line range is marked as being modified, if
.Fa changed
is 0 then the given line range is set to being unmodified.
.Pp
The
.Fn is_linetouched
function returns
.Dv TRUE
if
.Fa line
in window
.Fa win
has been modified since the last refresh was done, othereise
.Dv FALSE
is returned.
.Pp
.Fn is_wintouched
returns
.Dv TRUE
if the window
.Fa win
has been modified since the last refresh, otherwise
.Dv FALSE
is returned.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Functions returning pointers will return
.Dv NULL
if an error is detected.
The functions that return an int will return one of the following
values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ERR -compact
.It Er OK
The function completed successfully.
.It Er ERR
An error occurred in the function.
