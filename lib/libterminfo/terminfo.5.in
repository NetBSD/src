.Sh NAME
.Nm terminfo
.Nd terminal capability definition
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
describes the capabilities of terminals, used by programs such as
.Xr vi 1 ,
.Xr rogue 6
and libraries such as
.Xr curses 3 .
The
.Nm
source described here needs to be compiled with
.Xr tic 1
to be of any use.
.Pp
Entries in
.Nm
consist of a number of comma seperated fields.
White space after each comma is ignored.
Embedded commas must be escaped by using a backslash.
Lines beginning with # in the first column are treated as comments.
Blank lines are ignored.
.Pp
The header line must begin in column one and end with a comma.
Inside the header line are terminal name and aliases,
seperated by vertical bars, the last one being the long
description of the terminal.
.Pp
Capability lines then follow, starting on column two and end with a comma.
Each capability is listed by its name, followed by its value if applicable.
Booleans have no values, numeric values are prefixed by # and
strings are prefixed by =.
Numbers can range from 0 to 32767 and string values can be up to 1000
characters long.
This implementation supports strings upto 32767 characters long, including the
.Dv NUL
terminator.
.Pp
Some escapes are available for strings - both
.Sy \eE
and
.Sy \ee
map to the
.Dv ESC
character,
.Sy ^X
maps to a control-X for any appropriate X, and the sequences
.Sy \en ,
.Sy \er ,
.Sy \et ,
.Sy \eb
and
.Sy \ef
map to linefeed, return, tab, backspace and formfeed respectively.
Any character can be escaped in octal, such as
.Sy \e072 .
If you need to encode a
.Dv NUL
character, it should be escaped as
.Sy \e200 .
.Pp
A delay in milliseconds my appear anywhere in a string capability,
prefixed with a dollar and enclosed by angled brackets, such as
.Sy $<5> .
.Ss String Parameters
String capabilities sometimes requires parameters.
Normally this just involves replacing the parameter with a supplied
variable, however there are cases where the variable need to be manipulated
or used in conditional expressions.
A stack is also provided for simple pop and push operations.
.Pp
The below % encodings have the following meanings:
.Bl -tag -width %P[a-z]
.It Sy %%
outputs %
.It Sy %[[:]flags][width[.precision]][doxXs]
flags are [-+# ].
Prefix with : to avoid interpreting %- as an operator.
.It Sy %c
pop a parameter and print the character representation of it.
.It Sy %s
pop a parameter and print the string representation of it.
.It Sy %p[1-9]
push the parameter [1-9].
.It Sy %P[a-z]
pop a parameter and push it to dynamic variable [a-z].
.It Sy %g[a-z]
push the dynamic variable [a-z].
.It Sy %P[A-Z]
pop a parameter and push it to static variable [a-z].
.It Sy %g[A-Z]
push the dynamic variable [A-Z].
.Pp
Static variables persist over
.Fn tparm
where-as dyanmic variables do not.
.It Sy %'c'
char constant c.
.It Sy %{nn}
integer constant nn.
.It Sy %l
push the string length of the previously popped parameter.
.It Sy %+ Sy %- Sy %* Sy %/ Sy %m
arithmetic: pop two parameters and push the result.
.It Sy %& Sy %| Sy %^
bit operations: pop two parameters and push the result.
.It Sy %! Sy %~
unary operations: pop two parameters and push the result.
.It Sy %i
add 1 to parameters 1 and 2.
.It Sy %? Va expr Sy %t Ic then Sy %e Ic else Sy %;
If expr equates to zero then contol passes to the optional else part.

.Ss Fetching Compiled Descriptions
If the environment variable
.Ev TERMINFO
is available, .db is appended to it and only this database is used.
Otherwise

and
.Pa /etc/terminfo.db .
