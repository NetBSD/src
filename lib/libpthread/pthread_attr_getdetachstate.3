.Lb libpthread
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In pthread.h
.Ft int
.Fn pthread_attr_getdetachstate "const pthread_attr_t *attr" "int *detachstate"
.Ft int
.Fn pthread_attr_setdetachstate "pthread_attr_t *attr" "int detachstate"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The attribute parameters for the
.Fn pthread_attr_getdetachstate
and
.Fn pthread_attr_setdetachstate
functions are mutually exclusive and must be one of:
.Bl -tag -width PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED -offset 2n
.It Dv PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE
The threads must explicitly be waited for using the
.Xr pthread_join 3
function once they exit for their status to be received and their resources
to be freed.
This is the default.
.It Dv PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED
The thread's resources will automatically be freed once the thread exits,
and the thread will not be joined.
.El

If the thread is created as detached,
it is an error to use the thread ID with
.Xr pthread_detach 3
or
.Xr pthread_join 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, these functions return 0.
Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
No errors are defined for
.Fn pthread_attr_getdetachstate .
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_attr_setdetachstate
function should fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
