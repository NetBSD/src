/*
 * To track threads waiting for mutexes to be released, we use lockless
 * lists built on atomic operations and memory barriers.
 *
 * A simple spinlock would be faster and make the code easier to
 * follow, but spinlocks are problematic in userspace.  If a thread is
 * preempted by the kernel while holding a spinlock, any other thread
 * attempting to acquire that spinlock will needlessly busy wait.
 *
 * There is no good way to know that the holding thread is no longer
 * running, nor to request a wake-up once it has begun running again. 
 * Of more concern, threads in the SCHED_FIFO class do not have a
 * limited time quantum and so could spin forever, preventing the
 * thread holding the spinlock from getting CPU time: it would never
 * be released.
