.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In pthread.h
.Ft int
.Fn pthread_attr_getschedparam \
"const pthread_attr_t * restrict attr" "struct sched_param * restrict param"
.Ft int
.Fn pthread_attr_setschedparam \

.Fn pthread_attr_getschedpolicy \
"const pthread_attr_t * restrict attr" "int * restrict policy"
.Ft int
.Fn pthread_attr_setschedpolicy "pthread_attr_t *attr" "int policy"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pthread_attr_getschedparam
and
.Fn pthread_attr_setschedparam
functions obtain and set the scheduling parameter attribute in the
.Fa attr
object.
The
.Vt sched_param
structure is defined in
.In sched.h .
At minimum this structure contains only a single member,
.Vt sched_priority .
Refer to
.Xr pthread_schedparam 3
and
.Xr sched 3
for additional details.
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_attr_getschedpolicy
and
.Fn pthread_attr_setschedpolicy
functions get and set the scheduling policy attribute,
.Fa policy ,
in the
.Fa attr
object.
The supported values of
.Fa policy
are the same ones listed in
.Xr pthread_schedparam 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, all described functions return 0.
Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn pthread_attr_getschedparam
function may fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
An invalid parameter was specified.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_attr_setschedparam
function may fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
An invalid parameter was specified.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM

.El
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_attr_setschedpolicy
function may fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
There was insufficient memory.
.It Bq Er ENOTSUP
An unsupported
.Fa policy
was specified.
.El
.Pp
No errors are defined for
.Fn pthread_attr_getschedpolicy .
