.Dt PTHREAD_CLEANUP 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pthread_cleanup_push ,
.Nm pthread_cleanup_pop
.Nd add and remove cleanup functions for thread exit
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libpthread
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In pthread.h
.Ft void
.Fn pthread_cleanup_push "void \*[lp]*cleanup_routine\*[rp]\*[lp]void *\*[rp]" "void *arg"
.Ft void
.Fn pthread_cleanup_pop "int execute"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pthread_cleanup_push
function adds
.Fa cleanup_routine
to the top of the stack of cleanup handlers that
get called when the current thread exits.
.Pp
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_cleanup_pop
function pops the top cleanup routine off of the current threads cleanup
routine stack, and, if
.Fa execute
is non-zero, it will execute the function.
.Pp
When
.Fa cleanup_routine
is called, it is passed
.Fa arg
as its only argument.
.Pp
These functions may be implemented as macros which contain scope delimiters;
therefore, there must be a matching
.Fn pthread_cleanup_pop
for every 
.Fn pthread_cleanup_push
at the same level of lexical scoping.
.Pp
The effect of calling
.Fn longjmp
or
.Fn siglongjmp
is undefined after a call to
.Fn pthread_cleanup_push
but before the matching call to
.Fn pthread_cleanup_pop
after the jump buffer was filled.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Neither
.Fn pthread_cleanup_push
nor
.Fn pthread_cleanup_pop
returns a value.
.Sh ERRORS
None.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr pthread_exit 3
.Sh STANDARDS
.Fn pthread_cleanup_push
and
.Fn pthread_cleanup_pop
conform to
.St -p1003.1-96 .
