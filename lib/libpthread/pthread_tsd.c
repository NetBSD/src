	 * This is tricky.  The standard says of pthread_key_create()

	 * reconsidered when it was.

	 * See David Butenhof's article in comp.programming.threads:
	 * Subject: Re: TSD key reusing issue
	 * Message-ID: <u97d8.29$fL6.200@news.cpqcorp.net>
	 * Date: Thu, 21 Feb 2002 09:06:17 -0500

	 * 
	 * Given:
	 *
	 * 1: Applications are not required to clear keys in all
	 *    threads before calling pthread_key_delete().
	 * 2: Clearing pointers without running destructors is a
	 *    memory leak.
	 * 3: The pthread_key_delete() function is expressly forbidden
	 *    to run any destructors.
	 *
	 * Option 1: Make this function effectively a no-op and
	 * prohibit key reuse. This is a possible resource-exhaustion
	 * problem given that we have a static storage area for keys,
	 * but having a non-static storage area would make
	 * pthread_setspecific() expensive (might need to realloc the
	 * TSD array).
	 *
	 * Option 2: Ignore the specified behavior of
	 * pthread_key_create() and leave the old values. If an
	 * application deletes a key that still has non-NULL values in
	 * some threads... it's probably a memory leak and hence
	 * incorrect anyway, and we're within our rights to let the
	 * application lose. However, it's possible (if unlikely) that
	 * the application is storing pointers to non-heap data, or
	 * non-pointers that have been wedged into a void pointer, so
	 * we can't entirely write off such applications as incorrect.
	 * This could also lead to running (new) destructors on old
	 * data that was never supposed to be associated with that
	 * destructor.
	 *
	 * Option 3: Follow the specified behavior of
	 * pthread_key_create().  Either pthread_key_create() or
	 * pthread_key_delete() would then have to clear the values in
	 * every thread's slot for that key. In order to guarantee the
	 * visibility of the NULL value in other threads, there would
	 * have to be synchronization operations in both the clearer
	 * and pthread_getspecific().  Putting synchronization in
	 * pthread_getspecific() is a big performance lose.  But in
	 * reality, only (buggy) reuse of an old key would require
	 * this synchronization; for a new key, there has to be a
	 * memory-visibility propagating event between the call to
	 * pthread_key_create() and pthread_getspecific() with that
	 * key, so setting the entries to NULL without synchronization
	 * will work, subject to problem (2) above. However, it's kind
	 * of slow.
	 *
	 * Note that the argument in option 3 only applies because we
	 * keep TSD in ordinary memory which follows the pthreads
	 * visibility rules. The visibility rules are not required by
	 * the standard to apply to TSD, so the argument doesn't
	 * apply in general, just to this implementation.

	 * ...
	 * [*] That is, unfortunately, not what the standard

	 * they say what they say, not what they were intended to

	 * specifying that "the implementation clears the
	 * thread-specific data value before calling the destructor"
	 * was deleted. Nobody noticed, and the standard was approved
	 * with the error. So the standard says (by omission) that if
	 * you want to write a portable application using
	 * thread-specific data, that will not hang on thread
	 * termination, you must call pthread_setspecific within your
	 * destructor function to change the value to NULL. This would
	 * be silly, and any serious implementation of Pthreads will
	 * violate the standard in this respect. Of course, the
	 * standard will be fixed, probably by the 1003.1n amendment
	 * (assorted corrections to 1003.1c-1995), but that will take
	 * a while.''
