.Dt PTHREAD_SPIN_LOCK 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pthread_spin_lock ,
.Nm pthread_spin_trylock
.Nd acquire a spin lock
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libpthread
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In pthread.h
.Ft int
.Fn pthread_spin_lock "pthread_spinlock_t *lock"
.Ft int
.Fn pthread_spin_trylock "pthread_spinlock_t *lock"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pthread_spin_lock
function acquires a spin lock on
.Fa lock
provided that
.Fa lock
is not presently held. If the lock cannot be
immediately acquired, the calling thread repeatedly retries until it can
acquire the lock.
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_spin_trylock
function performs the same action, but does not block if the lock
cannot be immediately obtained (i.e. the lock is held).
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, the
.Fn pthread_spin_lock
and
.Fn pthread_spin_trylock
functions will return zero.  Otherwise an error number will be returned
to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn pthread_spin_trylock
function shall fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EBUSY
The lock could not be acquired because a writer holds the lock or
was blocked on it.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_spin_lock
function may fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EDEADLK
The current thread already owns
.Fa lock
for writing.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_spin_lock
and
.Fn pthread_spin_trylock
functions may fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The value specified by
.Fa lock
is invalid.
.El

.Xr pthread_spin_init 3 ,
.Xr pthread_spin_destroy 3 ,

.Sh STANDARDS
.Fn pthread_spin_lock
and
.Fn pthread_spin_trylock
conform to
.St -p1003.1-2001 .
