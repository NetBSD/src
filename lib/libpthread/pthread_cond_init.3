.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pthread_cond_init
.Nd create a condition variable
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libpthread
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In pthread.h
.Ft int
.Fn pthread_cond_init "pthread_cond_t *cond" "const pthread_condattr_t *attr"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pthread_cond_init
function creates a new condition variable, with attributes specified with
.Fa attr .
If
.Fa attr
is NULL the default attributes are used.
.Pp
Condition variables are intended to be used to communicate changes in
the state of data shared between threads.  Condition variables are
always associated with a mutex to provide syncronized access to the
shared data.  A single predicate should always be assocateed with a
condition variable.  The predicate should identify a state of the 
shared data that must be true before the thread proceeds.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, the
.Fn pthread_cond_init
function will return zero and put the new condition variable id into
.Fa cond ,
otherwise an error number will be returned to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn pthread_cond_init
shall fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
The process cannot allocate enough memory to initialize another condition
variable.
.It Bq Er EAGAIN
The system lacks the resources to initialize another condition variable.
.El
.Pp
.Fn pthread_cond_init
may fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The value specified by
.Fa attr
is invalid.
