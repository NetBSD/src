#	Remember to update distrib/sets/lists/base/shl.* when changing
#
# Things to do when bumping major version:
#
# - pthread_foo_t:
#
#	clean out unused and abused members.
#
#	add spare members.
#
#	add members to deal with inter-process synch and priority inheritance.
#
#	make objects same size and layout on 32/64 bit, so kernel can
#	inspect them for priority inheritance / inter-process synch,
#	without compat_netbsd32 shims??
