.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm threads
.Nd C11 thread support library
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libpthread
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In threads.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The C11 thread support library provides an implementation of a portable threading
interface, built on top of the
.Xr pthread 3
native interfaces.
This library is composed of:
.Bl -dash
.It
Initialization functions.
.It
Condition variable functions.
.It
Mutex functions.
.It
Thread functions.
.It
Thread-specifig storage functions.
.El
.Bl -column "mtx_timedwait"
.It Sy "Function"      Ta Sy "Summary"
.It Xr call_once 3     Ta calls function exactly once
.It Xr cnd_broadcast 3 Ta unblocks all threads blocked on a condition
.It Xr cnd_destroy 3   Ta releases all resources used by a condition
.It Xr cnd_init 3      Ta creates a condition variable
.It Xr cnd_signal 3    Ta unblocks one of threads blocked on a condition
.It Xr cnd_timedwait 3 Ta unlocks a mutex and blocks until a signal or timeout
.It Xr cnd_wait 3      Ta unlocks a mutex and blocks until a signal
.It Xr mtx_destroy 3   Ta releases resources used by a mutex
.It Xr mtx_init 3      Ta creates a mutex object with requested properties
.It Xr mtx_lock 3      Ta blocks on a mutex optionally with a recursive type
.It Xr mtx_timedwait 3 Ta tries to block until it locks a mutex or timeout
.It Xr mtx_trylock 3   Ta tries to lock a mutex
.It Xr mtx_unlock 3    Ta unlocks a mutex
.It Xr thrd_create 3   Ta creates a thread executing a function with a parameter
.It Xr thrd_current 3  Ta identifies the thread that called this function
.It Xr thrd_detach 3   Ta dispose of resources allocated to a thread on exit
.It Xr thrd_equal 3    Ta determines whether two threads refer the same thread
.It Xr thrd_exit 3     Ta terminates a calling thread and sets its result code
.It Xr thrd_join 3     Ta joins a thread with the current one and blocks
.It Xr thrd_sleep 3    Ta suspends a calling thread until a signal or timeout
.It Xr tss_create 3    Ta creates a thread-specific storage pointer with a destructor
.It Xr tss_delete 3    Ta releases resources used by a thread-specific storage
.It Xr tss_get 3       Ta gets a value of thread-specific storage from a key
.It Xr tss_set 3       Ta sets a value of thread-specific storage to a key
