.Sh NAME
.Nm threads
.Nd C11 thread support library
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libpthread
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In threads.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Portable Threads library provides an implementation of portable threading
interface, built on top of the
.Xr pthread 3
native interfaces.
This library is composed of:
.Bl -dash
.It
Initialization functions.
.It
Condition variable functions.
.It
Mutex functions.
.It
Thread functions.
.It
Thread-specifig storage functions.
.El
.Bl -column "mtx_timedwait"
.It Sy "Function"      Ta Sy "Summary"
.It Xr call_once 3     Ta calls function exactly once
.It Xr cnd_broadcast 3 Ta unblocks all threads blocked on a condition
.It Xr cnd_destroy 3   Ta releases all resources used by a condition
.It Xr cnd_init 3      Ta creates a condition variable
.It Xr cnd_signal 3    Ta unblocks one of threads blocked on a condition
.It Xr cnd_timedwait 3 Ta unlocks a mutex and blocks until a signal or timeout
.It Xr cnd_wait 3      Ta unlocks a mutex and blocks until a signal
.It Xr mtx_destroy 3   Ta releases resources used by a mutex
.It Xr mtx_init 3      Ta creates a mutex object with requested properties
.It Xr mtx_lock 3      Ta blocks on a mutex optionally with a recursive type
.It Xr mtx_timedwait 3 Ta tries to block until it locks a mutex or timeout
.It Xr mtx_trylock 3   Ta tries to lock a mutex
.It Xr mtx_unlock 3    Ta unlocks a mutex
.It Xr thrd_create 3   Ta creates a thread executing a function with a parameter
.It Xr thrd_current 3  Ta identifies the thread that called this function
.It Xr thrd_detach 3   Ta dispose of resources allocatd to a thread on exit
.It Xr thrd_equal 3    Ta determines whether two threads reffer the same thread
.It Xr thrd_exit 3     Ta terminates a calling thread and sets its result code
.It Xr thrd_join 3     Ta joins a thread with the current one and blocks
.It Xr thrd_sleep 3    Ta suspends a calling thread until a signal or timeout
.It Xr tss_create 3    Ta crates a thread-specific storage pointer with a dtor
.It Xr tss_delete 3    Ta releases resources used by a thread-specific storage
.It Xr tss_get 3       Ta gets a value of thread-specific storage from a key
.It Xr tss_set 3       Ta sets a value of thread-specific storage to a key
