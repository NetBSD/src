.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn sched_yield
yields a processor voluntarily and gives other threads a chance
to run without waiting involuntary preemptive switch.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success,
.Fn sched_yield
returns zero.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.

.Sh CAVEATS
This implementation of
.Fn sched_yield
gives processor to threads which belong to the same process.
In other words, it's no-op in a single threaded application.
