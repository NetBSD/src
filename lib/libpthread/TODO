Interfaces/features to implement:

- Realtime extensions: priority inheritance.

- Allow threads to change their stack size.

- Allow threads to modify the red zone size; cf. pthread_attr_setguardsize(3).

- Keep a pool of dead LWPs so that we do not have take the full hit of
  _lwp_create() every time pthread_create() is called.

- kill pthread__dbg (pthread_dbg(3) has been removed from base)
