$NetBSD: TODO,v 1.10.2.2 2008/01/09 01:36:30 matt Exp $

Bugs to fix:

- Add locking to ld.elf_so so that multiple threads doing lazy binding
  doesn't trash things.

Interfaces/features to implement:

- Realtime exensions: priority scheduling, priority inheritance.

- Allow threads to change their stack size.

- Keep a pool of dead LWPs so that we do not have take the full hit of
  _lwp_create() every time pthread_create() is called.
