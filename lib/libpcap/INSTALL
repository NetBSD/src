To build libpcap, first customize any paths in Makefile.in, then run
./configure (a shell script).  "configure" will determine your system
attributes and generate an appropriate Makefile from Makefile.in.  Next
run "make", and if everything goes well, su and run "make install".
(If you're system is not listed in the README as one which we have
tested, you may have to modify the configure script and Makefile.in;
please send us patches for any modifications you need to make.)  You
need not install libpcap if you just want to build tcpdump (but make
sure tcpdump and libpcap have the same parent directory during the
build).

You will need an ANSI C compiler to build libpcap.  If your compiler is
not ANSI compliant, use the GNU C compiler, available via anonymous
ftp:

	ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gcc-*.tar.gz

If you use flex, version 2.4.6 or higher is recommended.  The current
version of flex is available via anonymous ftp:

	ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/flex-*.tar.Z

Earlier versions of 2.4 require declarations for some internal memory
allocator routines.  Version 2.3 and earlier caused typedef conflicts
with sys/types.h.  If you don't have a version of flex that works,
plain old lex works ok.  But if you use lex/yacc, libpcap will have
symbols that will conflict with other yacc/lex generated code (yes,
this can be fixed with a script that maps the yy* identifiers, but flex
and bison do this automatically so we haven't bothered).  Note that the
stock version of flex under DEC OSF/1 is 2.3.

If you use Solaris, there is a bug with bufmod(7) that is supposed to
be fixed in 5.3.2.  Setting a snapshot length with the broken bufmod(7)
results in data be truncated from the FRONT of the packet instead of
the end.  The work around is to not set a snapshot length but this
results in performance problems since the entire packet is copied to
user space.  There is a patch available from Sun; ask for bugid
1149065.  After installing the patch, use "setenv BUFMOD_FIXED" to
enable use of bufmod(7).

If linking tcpdump fails with "Undefined: _alloca" when using bison on
a Sun4, your version of bison is broken.  Either pick up a current
version from:

	ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/bison-*.tar.gz

or hack around it by inserting the lines:

	#ifdef __GNUC__
	#define alloca __builtin_alloca
	#else
	#ifdef sparc
	#include <alloca.h>
	#else
	char *alloca ();
	#endif
	#endif

right after the (100 line!) GNU license comment in bison.simple, remove
sun4-sunos4/tcpgram.[co], and fire up make again.

If you are running a version of SunOS earlier than 4.1, you will need
to replace the Sun supplied /sys/sun{3,4,4c}/OBJ/nit_if.o with the
appropriate version from this distribution's SUNOS4 subdirectory and
build a new kernel:

       nit_if.o.sun3-sunos4		(any flavor of sun3)
       nit_if.o.sun4c-sunos4.0.3c	(SS1, SS1+, IPC, SLC, etc.)
       nit_if.o.sun4-sunos4		(Sun4's not covered by
					    nit_if.o.sun4c-sunos4.0.3c)

These nit replacements fix a bug that makes nit essentially unusable in
pre-SunOS 4.1.  In addition, our sun4c-sunos4.0.3c nit gives you
timestamps to the resolution of the SS-1 clock (1 us) rather than the
lousy 20ms timestamps Sun gives you  (tcpdump will print out the full
timestamp resolution if it finds it's running on a SS-1).
