rump kernel (librump, \-lrump)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In rump/rump.h
.Ft int
.Fn rump_pub_lwproc_newproc
.Ft int
.Fn rump_pub_lwproc_newlwp "pid_t pid"
.Ft void
.Fn rump_pub_lwproc_switch "struct lwp *l"
.Ft void
.Fn rump_pub_lwproc_releaselwp
.Ft struct lwp *
.Fn rump_pub_lwproc_curlwp
.Sh DESCRIPTION
In a normal operating system model a process is a resource
container and a thread (lwp) is the execution context.
Every lwp is associated with exactly one process, and a process is
associated with one or more lwps.
The current lwp (curlwp) indicates the current process and determines
which resources, such as UID/GID, current working directory, and
file descriptor table, are currently used.
These basic principles apply to rump kernels as well, but since
rump uses the host's thread and process context directly, the rules
for how thread context is determined are different.
.Pp
In the rump model, each host thread (pthread) is either bound to
a rump kernel lwp or accesses the rump kernel with an implicit thread
context associated with the system process proc0.
The implicit thread context is created every time the rump kernel
is entered and disbanded upon exit.
While convenient for occasional calls, creating the implicit thread
uses a shared resource which can become highly contended in a
multithreaded situation.
It is therefore recommended that dedicated threads are created.
.Pp
The association between host threads and the rump kernel curlwp is
left to the caller.
It is possible to create a dedicated host thread for every
rump kernel lwp or multiplex them on top of a single host thread.
After rump lwps have been created, switching curlwp is very cheap
-- faster than a thread context switch on the host.
In case multiple lwps/processes are created, it is the caller's
responsibility to keep track of them and release them when they
are no longer necessary.
Like other rump kernel resources, procs/lwps will be released when
the process hosting the rump kernel exits.
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Fn rump_pub_lwproc_newproc
Create a process and one lwp inside it.
Sets curlwp to the new lwp.
The new process id can be retrieved in the normal fashion by calling
.Fn rump_sys_getpid .
This routine returns 0 for success or an errno indicating the reason
for failure.
.It Fn rump_pub_lwproc_newlwp "pid"
Create a new lwp attached to the process specified by
.Fa pid .
Sets curlwp to the new lwp.
This routine returns 0 for success or an errno indicating the reason
for failure.
.It Fn rump_pub_lwproc_switch "l"
Sets curlwp to
.Fa l .
In case the new thread is associated with a different process than the
current one, the process context is also switched.
The special value
.Dv NULL
sets curlwp to implicit proc0 context.
Switching to an already running lwp, i.e. attempting to use the
same curlwp in two host threads simultaneously causes a fatal error.
.It Fn rump_pub_lwproc_releaselwp
Release curlwp and set curlwp to proc0 context.
In case curlwp was the last thread inside the current process, the
process container is also released.
Calling this routine without a dedicated curlwp is a fatal error.
.It Fn rump_pub_lwproc_curlwp
Returns curlwp or
.Dv NULL
if the current context is the implicit proc0 context.
