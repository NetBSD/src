.Sh NAME
.Nm SHA3_Selftest
.Nd NIST FIPS PUB 202: SHA-3 Standard: Permutation-Based Hash and Extendable-Output Functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sha3.h
.Ft int
.Fn SHA3_Selftest "void"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function automatically tests a number of SHA-3 computations on fixed
inputs with with known outputs to make sure the
.Xr sha3 3
library is not catastrophically broken.
Applications should call
.Fn SHA3_Selftest
and confirm that it succeeded before using the
.Xr sha3 3 ,
.Xr SHAKE 3 ,
or
.Xr keccak 3
functions.
.Pp
.Fn SHA3_Selftest
returns 0 if successful, or -1 if the self-test failed.
.Pp
The
.Fn SHA3_Selftest
function costs a few hundred thousand cycles on most CPUs, since it
involves a little over a hundred calls to the Keccak permutation,
which usually take one or two thousand cycles each.
