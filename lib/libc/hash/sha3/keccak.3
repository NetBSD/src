.Sh NAME
.Nm Keccak
.Nd NIST FIPS PUB 202: SHA-3 Standard: Permutation-Based Hash and Extendable-Output Functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In keccak.h
.Ft void
.Fn keccakf1600 "uint64_t A[25]"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
functions implement the core Keccak permutation of the NIST SHA-3
standard, FIPS PUB 202.
.Pp
Before using the
.Nm
functions, applications should first call
.Xr SHA3_Selftest 3
and confirm that it succeeded.
.Pp
The
.Fn keccakf1600
function implements the 24-round Keccak-f[1600] permutation on a state
of twenty-five 64-bit words, to be loaded from or stored to octets in
little-endian order.
.Pp
This function scrambles a 1600-bit state, and is conjectured to look
like a random permutation.
It lies at the core of all the SHA-3 hash and extendable-output
functions, and can be used for other cryptographic constructions,
e.g. a sponge duplex.
.Pp
The permutation Keccak-f[1600] is also known as Keccak-p[1600, 24].
