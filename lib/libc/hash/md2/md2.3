.Sh DESCRIPTION
The MD2 functions calculate a 128-bit cryptographic checksum (digest)
for any number of input bytes.
A cryptographic checksum is a one-way
hash-function, that is, you cannot find (except by exhaustive search)
the input corresponding to a particular output.
This net result is
a ``fingerprint'' of the input-data, which doesn't disclose the actual
input.
.Pp
The MD2 routines should not be used for any security-related purpose.
.Pp
The
.Fn MD2Init ,
.Fn MD2Update ,
and
.Fn MD2Final
functions are the core functions.
Allocate an MD2_CTX, initialize it with
.Fn MD2Init ,
run over the data with
.Fn MD2Update ,
and finally extract the result using
.Fn MD2Final .
.Pp
.Fn MD2End
is a wrapper for
.Fn MD2Final
which converts the return value to a 33-character
(including the terminating '\e0') ASCII
string which represents the 128 bits in hexadecimal.
.Pp
.Fn MD2File
calculates the digest of a file, and uses
.Fn MD2End
to return the result.
If the file cannot be opened, a null pointer is returned.
.Fn MD2Data
calculates the digest of a chunk of data in memory, and uses
.Fn MD2End
to return the result.
.Pp
When using
.Fn MD2End ,
.Fn MD2File ,
or
.Fn MD2Data ,
the
.Ar buf
argument can be a null pointer, in which case the returned string
is allocated with
.Xr malloc 3
and subsequently must be explicitly deallocated using
.Xr free 3
after use.
If the
.Ar buf
argument is non-null it must point to at least 33 characters of buffer space.

The original MD2 routines were developed by

and published in the above references.
This code is a public domain implementation by

.Sh BUGS
No method is known to exist which finds two files having the same hash value,
nor to find a file with a specific hash value.
There is on the other hand no guarantee that such a method doesn't exist.
