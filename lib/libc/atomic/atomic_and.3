.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm atomic_and
family of functions load the value of the variable referenced by
.Fa ptr ,
perform a bitwise
.Sq and
with the value
.Fa bits ,
and store the result back to the variable referenced by
.Fa ptr
in an atomic fashion.
.Pp
The
.Fn *_nv
variants of these functions return the new value.
.Pp
The 64-bit variants of these functions are available only on platforms
that can support atomic 64-bit memory access.
Applications can check for the availability of 64-bit atomic memory
operations by testing if the pre-processor macro
.Dv __HAVE_ATOMIC64_OPS
is defined.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr atomic_ops 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm atomic_and
functions first appeared in
.Nx 5.0 .
