.Sh NAME
.Nm strings
.Nd string operations
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In strings.h
.Ft int
.Fn bcmp "const void *b1" "const void *b2" "size_t len"
.Ft void
.Fn bcopy "const void *src" "void *dst" "size_t len"
.Ft void
.Fn bzero "void *b" "size_t len"
.Ft int
.Fn ffs "int value"
.Ft char *
.Fn index "const char *s" "int c"
.Ft char *
.Fn rindex "const char *s" "int c"
.Ft int
.Fn strcasecmp "const char *s1" "const char *s2"
.Ft int
.Fn strncasecmp "const char *s1" "const char *s2" "size_t len"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions all live in the
.In strings.h
header file.
Except for
.Fn ffs ,
they operate on strings.
.Fn index ,
.Fn rindex ,
and
.Fn strcasecmp
need nul-terminated strings.
.Pp
See the specific manual pages for more information.
.Pp
See
.Xr string 3
for string functions that follow
.St -ansiC
or
.St -isoC-99 ,
.Xr bstring 3
for functions that operate on strings that are not nul-terminated, and
.Xr bitstring 3
for bit-string manipulation macros.
