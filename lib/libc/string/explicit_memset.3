.In string.h
.Ft void *
.Fn explicit_memset "void *b" "int c" "size_t len"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn explicit_memset
function writes
.Fa len
bytes of value

.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn explicit_memset
function returns the original value of

.Sh EXAMPLES
Create a buffer on the stack for a secret key, use it, and then zero it
in memory before throwing it away.

	\&...
