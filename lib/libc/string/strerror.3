.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn strerror ,
.Fn strerror_l ,
.\".Fn strerror_lr ,
.Fn strerror_r ,
and
.Fn perror
functions look up the language-dependent error message
string corresponding to an error number.
.Pp
The
.Fn strerror
function accepts an error number argument
.Fa errnum
and returns a pointer to the corresponding
message string.
The application should not attempt to modify the
returned string, it may be shared, or read only.
.Pp
The
.Fn strerror_r
function renders the same result into
.Fa strerrbuf
for a maximum of
.Fa buflen
characters (including terminator) and returns 0 upon success.
.Pp
The
.Fn strerror_l
function is like
.Fn strerror
but provides in
.Fa loc
the locale to be used to obtain the language for the message,
rather than using the application's current locale.
.\".Pp
.\"The
.\".Fn strerror_lr
.\"function is to
.\".Fn strerror_l
.\"as
.\".Fn strerror_r
.\"is to
.\".Fn strerror .
.Pp
The
.Fn perror
function finds the error message corresponding to the current
value of the global variable
.Va errno
.Pq Xr intro 2
and writes it, followed by a newline, to the
standard error file descriptor.
If the argument
.Fa string
is
.Pf non- Dv NULL
and does not point to the nul character,
this string is prepended to the message
string and separated from it by
a colon and space
.Pq Dq Li ":\ " ;
otherwise, only the error message string is printed.
Note that in most cases the
.Xr err 3
and
.Xr warn 3
family of functions is preferable to
.Fn perror ;
they are more flexible and also print the program name.
.Pp
If the error number is not recognized, these functions return an error message
string containing
.\" , in the appropriate language,
.Dq Li "Unknown error:\ "
followed by the error number in decimal.
To warn about this,
.Fn strerror
and
.Fn strerror_l
set
.Dv errno
to
.Er EINVAL ,
and
.Fn strerror_r
.\"and
.\".Fn strerror_lr
returns
.Er EINVAL .
In other cases, except where noted below,
.Dv errno
is not altered, so applications should set it to a known value
(usually zero) before calling either
.Fn strerror
or
.Fn strerror_l
if the resulting value in
.Dv errno
is to be tested for this condition.
Error numbers recognized by this implementation fall in
the range 0 <
.Fa errnum
<
.Fa sys_nerr .
.Pp
If insufficient storage is provided in
.Fa strerrbuf
(as specified in
.Fa buflen )
to contain the error string,
.Fn strerror_r
.\" and
.\" .Fn strerror_lr
returns
.Er ERANGE
and
.Fa strerrbuf
will contain an error message that has been truncated and
.Dv NUL
terminated to fit the length specified by
.Fa buflen .
In extraordinary cases, it is possible that the internal
buffer used by
.Fn strerror
and
.Fn strerror_l
may be too small for a translated message,
in which case it will be truncated as indicated for
.Fn strerror_r
and
.Dv errno
will be set to
.Er ERANGE .
.Pp
The POSIX locale message strings can be accessed directly using the external
array
.Va sys_errlist .
The external value
.Va sys_nerr
contains a count of the messages in
.Va sys_errlist .
The use of these variables is deprecated;
one of the
.Fn strerror
family of functions should be used instead.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
Programs that attempt to use the deprecated
.Va sys_errlist
variable often fail to compile because they provide their own,
inconsistent, declaration of it.
Such programs should be updated to use
.Fn strerror .
.Sh ERRORS
These functions may fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The error number was out of range.
.It Bq Er ERANGE
The string buffer supplied was not large enough to hold the complete
error message.

.Sh BUGS
The
.Fn strerror
function may return its result in a static buffer which
will be overwritten by subsequent calls.
For portable use, this must be assumed to be a subsequent
call from the current, or any other, thread in the process.
This implementation limits the issue to calls from the
current thread.
The
.Fn strerror_l
function has a similar restriction, but even in other
implementations, is required to use thread local storage,
so only other calls from the calling thread can overwrite
the result.
Both
.Fn strerror
and
.Fn strerror_l
use the same thread local storage; a call to either will destroy
the result from an earlier call by the same thread of either of them.
