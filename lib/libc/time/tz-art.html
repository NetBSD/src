<h2>Documentaries</h2>
<ul>
<li>
"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84aWtseb2-4">Daylight
Saving Time Explained</a>" (2011; 6:39) lightly covers daylight saving
time's theory, history, pros and cons. Among other things, it explains
Arizona's daylight-saving enclaves quite well.</li>
<li>
"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY">The Problem
with Time &amp; Timezones &ndash; Computerphile</a>" (2013; 10:12) delves
into problems that programmers have with timekeeping.</li>
<li>
"<a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/28375932.html">All The Time In The World:
Explaining The Mysteries Of Time Zones</a>" (2017; 2:15)
briefly says why France has more time zones than Russia.
<li>
"About Time" (1962; 59 minutes) is part of the
Bell Science extravaganza, with Frank Baxter, Richard Deacon, and Les Tremayne.
Its advisor was Richard Feynman, and it was voiced by Mel Blanc.
(<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0154110/">IMDb entry</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Movies</h2>
<ul>
<li>
In the 1946 movie <em>A Matter of Life and Death</em>
(U.S. title <em>Stairway to Heaven</em>)
there is a reference to British Double Summer Time.
The time does not play a large part in the plot;
it's just a passing reference to the time when one of the
characters was supposed to have died (but didn't).
(<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038733/">IMDb entry.</a>)
(Dave Cantor)
<li>
The 1953 railway comedy movie <em>The Titfield Thunderbolt</em> includes a
play on words on British Double Summer Time. Valentine's wife wants
him to leave the pub and asks him, "Do you know what time it is?"
And he, happy where he is, replies: "Yes, my love. Summer double time."
(<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046436/">IMDb entry.</a>)
(Mark Brader, 2009-10-02)
</li>
<li>
The premise of the 1999 caper movie <em>Entrapment</em> involves computers
in an international banking network being shut down briefly at
midnight in each time zone to avoid any problems at the transition
from the year 1999 to 2000 in that zone. (Hmmmm.) If this shutdown
is extended by 10 seconds, it will create a one-time opportunity for
a gigantic computerized theft. To achieve this, at one location the
crooks interfere with the microwave system supplying time signals to
the computer, advancing the time by 0.1 second each minute over the
last hour of 1999. (So this movie teaches us that 0.1 &times; 60 = 10.)
(<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137494/">IMDb entry.</a>)
(Mark Brader, 2009-10-02)
</li>
<li>
One mustn't forget the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4EUTMPuvHo">trailer</a>
(2014; 2:23) for the movie <em>Daylight Saving</em>.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>TV episodes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
An episode of <em>The Adventures of Superman</em> entitled "The Mysterious
Cube," first aired 1958-02-24, had Superman convincing the controllers
of the Arlington Time Signal to broadcast ahead of actual time;
doing so got a crook trying to be declared dead to
emerge a bit too early from the titular enclosure.
(<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0506628/">IMDb entry</a>.)
</li>
<li>
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chimes_of_Big_Ben">The Chimes
of Big Ben</a>", <em>The Prisoner</em>, episode 2, ITC, 1967-10-06.
Our protagonist tumbles to
the fraudulent nature of a Poland-to-England escape upon hearing "Big
Ben" chiming on Polish local time.
(<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0679185/">IMDb entry.</a>)
</li>
<li>
"The Susie", <em>Seinfeld</em>, season 8, episode 15, NBC, 1997-02-13.
Kramer decides that daylight saving time
isn't coming fast enough, so he sets his watch ahead an hour.
</li>
<li>
"20 Hours in America", <em>The West Wing</em>, season 4, episodes 1&ndash;2,
2002-09-25, contained a <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J1NHzQ1sgc">scene</a> that
saw White House staffers stranded in Indiana; they thought they had time to
catch Air Force One but were done in by intra-Indiana local time changes.
</li>
<li>
"In what time zone would you find New York City?" was a $200 question on
the 1999-11-13 United States airing of <em>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</em>,
and "In 1883, what industry led the movement to divide the U.S. into four time
zones?" was a $32,000 question on the 2001-05-23 United States airing of
the same show. At this rate, the million-dollar time-zone
question should have been asked 2002-06-04.
</li>
<li>
A private jet's mid-flight change of time zones distorts Alison Dubois'
premonition in the "We Had a Dream" episode of <em>Medium</em>
(originally aired 2007-02-28).

<li>
In the <em>30 Rock</em> episode "Anna Howard Shaw Day"
(first broadcast 2010-02-11),

received in the evening must be fake given the difference in local times.
</li>
<li>
In the "Run by the Monkeys" episode of <em>Da Vinci's Inquest</em>
(first broadcast 2002-11-17),
a witness in a five-year-old fire case realizes they may not have set
their clock back when daylight saving ended on the day of the fire,
introducing the possibility of an hour when arson might have occurred.
</li>
<li>
In "The Todd Couple" episode of <em>Outsourced</em> (first aired 2011-02-10),
Manmeet sets up Valentine's Day teledates for 6:00 and 9:00pm;
since one is with a New Yorker and the other with a San Franciscan,
hilarity ensues.
(Never mind that this should be 7:30am in Mumbai, yet for some reason the show
proceeds as though it's also mid-evening there.)
</li>
<li>
In the "14 Days to Go"/"T Minus..." episode of
<em>You, Me and the Apocalypse</em>
(first aired 2015-11-11 in the UK, 2016-03-10 in the US),
the success of a mission to deal with a comet
hinges on whether or not Russia observes daylight saving time.
(In the US, the episode first aired in the week before the switch to DST.)
</li>

asked, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br0NW9ufUUw">Daylight Saving
Time &ndash; How Is This Still A Thing?</a>"
</li>
<li>

(<em>Le tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours</em>), 1873.

<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/103">an English
translation</a>, and
<a href="https://fourmilab.ch/etexts/www/tdm80j">the original French</a>
"with illustrations from the original 1873 French-language edition".

Island of the Day Before</em></a>
(<em>L'isola del giorno prima</em>), 1994.
"...the story of a 17th century Italian nobleman trapped near an island
on the International Date Line.  Time and time zones play an integral
part in the novel." (Paul Eggert, 2006-04-22)
</li>
<li>
John Dunning, <a
href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Two-OClock-Eastern-Wartime/John-Dunning/9781439171530"><em>Two
O'Clock, Eastern Wartime</em></a>, 2001.
Mystery, history, daylight saving time, and old-time radio.
</li>
<li>
Surrealist artist Guy Billout's work "Date Line" appeared on page 103
of the 1999-11 <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>.
</li>
<li>
"Gloom, Gloom, Go Away" by Walter Kirn appeared on page 106 of <em>Time</em>
magazine's 2002-11-11 issue; among other things, it proposed
year-round DST as a way of lessening wintertime despair.

<h2>Jokes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
The idea behind daylight saving time was first proposed as a joke by
Benjamin Franklin. To enforce it, he suggested, "Every
morning, as soon as the sun rises, let all the bells in every church
be set ringing; and if that is not sufficient, let cannon be fired in
every street, to wake the sluggards effectually, and make them open
their eyes to see their true interest. All the difficulty will be in
the first two or three days: after which the reformation will be as
natural and easy as the present irregularity; for, <em>ce n'est que le
premier pas qui co&ucirc;te</em>."
<a href="http://www.webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/franklin3.html">Franklin's
joke</a> was first published on 1784-04-26 by the
<em>Journal de Paris</em> as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Franklin-Benjamin-Journal-de-Paris-1784.jpg">an
anonymous letter translated into French</a>.
</li>
<li>
"We've been using the five-cent nickel in this country since 1492.
Now that's pretty near 100 years, daylight saving."
(Groucho Marx as Captain Spaulding in <em>Animal Crackers</em>, 1930,
as noted by Will Fitzgerald)
</li>
<li>
BRADY. ...[Bishop Usher] determined that the Lord began the Creation
on the 23rd of October in the Year 4,004 B.C. at &ndash; uh, 9 A.M.!
<br>
DRUMMOND. That Eastern Standard Time? (<em>Laughter.</em>) Or Rocky Mountain
Time? (<em>More laughter.</em>) It wasn't daylight-saving time, was it? Because
the Lord didn't make the sun until the fourth day!
<br>
