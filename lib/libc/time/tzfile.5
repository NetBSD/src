.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm tzfile
.Nd time zone information
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The timezone information files used by
.Xr tzset 3
are typically found under a directory with a name like
.Pa /usr/share/zoneinfo .
These files beging with a 44-byte header containing the following fields:
.Bl -bullet
.It
The magic four-byte ASCII sequence begin with the magic characters
.Dq TZif .
identifies the file as a timezone information file.
.It
A byte identifying the version of the file's format (as of 2017, either
an ASCII
.Dv NUL ,
or
.Dq 2 ,
or
.Dq 3 ).
.It
Fifteen bytes containing zeros reserved for future use.
.It
Six four-byte integer values written in a standard byte order
(the high-order byte of the value is written first).
These values are, in order:
.Bl -inset
.It Va tzh_ttisgmtcnt
The number of UT/local indicators stored in the file.
.It Va tzh_ttisstdcnt
The number of standard/wall indicators stored in the file.
.It Va tzh_leapcnt
The number of leap seconds for which data entries are stored in the file.
.It Va tzh_timecnt
The number of transition times for which data entries are stored
in the file.
.It Va tzh_typecnt
The number of local time types for which data entries are stored
in the file (must not be zero).
.It Va tzh_charcnt
The number of bytes of timezone abbreviation strings
stored in the file.
.El
.It
The above header is followed by the following fields, whose lengths
depend on the contents of the header:
.Bl -inset
.It Va tzh_timecnt
four-byte signed integer values sorted in ascending order.
These values are written in
These values are written in standard byte order.
Each is used as a transition time (as returned by
.Xr time 3 )
at which the rules for computing local time change.
.It Va tzh_timecnt
one-byte unsigned integer values;
each one but the last tells which of the different types of local time types
described in the file is associated with the time period
starting with the same-indexed transition time
and continuing up to but not including the next transition time.
(The last time type is present only for consistency checking with the
POSIX-style TZ string described below.)
These values serve as indices into the next field.
.It Va tzh_typecnt
.Va ttinfo
entries, each defined as follows:
.Bd -literal
struct ttinfo {
	int32_t		tt_gmtoff;
	unsigned char	tt_isdst;
	unsigned char	tt_abbrind;
};
.Ed
.Pp
Each structure is written as a four-byte signed integer value for
.Va tt_gmtoff
in a standard byte order, followed by a one-byte value for
.Va tt_isdst
and a one-byte value for
.Va tt_abbrind .
In each structure,
.Va tt_gmtoff
gives the number of seconds to be added to UT,
.Va tt_isdst
tells whether
.Va tm_isdst
should be set by
.Xr localtime 3
and
.Va tt_abbrind
serves as an index into the array of timezone abbreviation bytes
that follow the
.Va ttinfo
structure(s) in the file.
.It Va tzh_leapcnt
pairs of four-byte values, written in standard byte order;
the first value of each pair gives the time
(as returned by
.Xr time 3 )
at which a leap second occurs;
the second gives the
.Em total
number of leap seconds to be applied during the time period
starting at the given time.
The pairs of values are sorted in ascending order by time.
Each transition is for one leap second, either positive or negative;
transitions always separated by at least 28 days minus 1 second.
.It Va tzh_ttisstdcnt
standard/wall indicators, each stored as a one-byte value;
they tell whether the transition times associated with local time types
were specified as standard time or wall clock time,
and are used when a timezone file is used in handling POSIX-style
timezone environment variables.
.It Va tzh_ttisgmtcnt
UT/local indicators, each stored as a one-byte value;
they tell whether the transition times associated with local time types
were specified as UT or local time,
and are used when a timezone file is used in handling POSIX-style
timezone environment variables.
.Pp
The
.Xr localtime 3
function uses the first standard-time
.Fa ttinfo
structure in the file
(or simply the first
.Fa ttinfo
structure in the absence of a standard-time structure)
if either
.Va tzh_timecnt
is zero or the time argument is less than the first transition time recorded
in the file.
.El
.El
.Ss Version 2 format
For version-2-format timezone files,
the above header and data are followed by a second header and data,
identical in format except that
eight bytes are used for each transition time or leap second time.
(Leap second counts remain four bytes.)
After the second header and data comes a newline-enclosed,
POSIX-TZ-environment-variable-style string for use in handling instants
after the last transition time stored in the file
or for all instants if the file has no transitions.
The POSIX-style TZ string is empty (i.e., nothing between the newlines)
if there is no POSIX representation for such instants.
If nonempty, the POSIX-style TZ string must agree with the local time
type after the last transition time if present in the eight-byte data;
for example, given the string
.Dq WET0WEST,M3.5.0,M10.5.0/3
then if a last transition time is in July, the transition's local time
type must specify a daylight-saving time abbreviated
.Dq WEST
that is one hour east of UT.
Also, if there is at least one transition, time type 0 is associated
with the time period from the indefinite past up to but not including
the earliest transition time.
.Ss Version 3 format
For version-3-format timezone files, the POSIX-TZ-style string may
use two minor extensions to the POSIX TZ format, as described in
.Xr tzset 3 .
First, the hours part of its transition times may be signed and range from
\-167 through 167 instead of the POSIX-required unsigned values
from 0 through 24.
Second, DST is in effect all year if it starts
January 1 at 00:00 and ends December 31 at 24:00 plus the difference
between daylight saving and standard time.
.Ss Interoperability considerations
.Pp
Version 1 files are considered a legacy format and
should be avoided, as they do not support transition
times after the year 2038.
Readers that only understand Version 1 must ignore
any data that extends beyond the calculated end of the version
1 data block.
.PP
Writers should generate a version 3 file if
TZ string extensions are necessary to accurately
model transition times.
Otherwise, version 2 files should be generated.
.Pp
The sequence of time changes defined by the version 1
header and data block should be a contiguous subsequence
of the time changes defined by the version 2+ header and data
block, and by the footer.
This guideline helps obsolescent version 1 readers
agree with current readers about timestamps within the
contiguous subsequence.  It also lets writers not
supporting obsolescent readers use a
.Dv tzh_timecnt
of zero
in the version 1 data block to save space.
.Pp
Time zone designations should consist of at least three (3)
and no more than six (6) ASCII characters from the set of
alphanumerics,
.Dq \&- ,
and
.Dq + .
This is for compatibility with POSIX requirements for
time zone abbreviations.
.Pp
When reading a version 2 or 3 file, readers
should ignore the version 1 header and data block except for
the purpose of skipping over them.
.Pp
Readers should calculate the total lengths of the
headers and data blocks and check that they all fit within
the actual file size, as part of a validity check for the file.
.Ss Common interoperability issues
This section documents common problems in reading or writing TZif files.
Most of these are problems in generating TZif files for use by
older readers.
The goals of this section are:
.Bl -bullet
.It
to help TZif writers output files that avoid common
pitfalls in older or buggy TZif readers,
.It
to help TZif readers avoid common pitfalls when reading
files generated by future TZif writers, and
.It
to help any future specification authors see what sort of
problems arise when the TZif format is changed.
.El
.Pp
+When new versions of the TZif format have been defined, a
design goal has been that a reader can successfully use a TZif
file even if the file is of a later TZif version than what the
reader was designed for.
When complete compatibility was not achieved, an attempt was
made to limit glitches to rarely-used timestamps, and to allow
simple partial workarounds in writers designed to generate
new-version data useful even for older-version readers.
This section attempts to document these compatibility issues and
workarounds, as well as to document other common bugs in
readers.
.Pp
Interoperability problems with TZif include the following:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Some readers examine only version 1 data.
As a partial workaround, a writer can output as much version 1
data as possible.
However, a reader should ignore version 1 data, and should use
version 2+ data even if the reader's native timestamps have only
32 bits.
.It
Some readers designed for version 2 might mishandle
timestamps after a version 3 file's last transition, because
they cannot parse extensions to POSIX in the TZ-like string.
As a partial workaround, a writer can output more transitions
than necessary, so that only far-future timestamps are
mishandled by version 2 readers.
.It
Some readers designed for version 2 do not support
permanent daylight saving time, e.g., a TZ string
.Dq EST5EDT,0/0,J365/25
denoting permanent Eastern Daylight Time (\&-04).
As a partial workaround, a writer can substitute standard time
for the next time zone east, e.g.,
.Dq AST4
+for permanent Atlantic Standard Time (\&-04).
.It
Some readers ignore the footer, and instead predict future
timestamps from the time type of the last transition.
As a partial workaround, a writer can output more transitions
than necessary.
.It
Some readers do not use time type 0 for timestamps before
the first transition, in that they infer a time type using a
heuristic that does not always select time type 0.
As a partial workaround, a writer can output a dummy (no-op)
first transition at an early time.
.It
Some readers mishandle timestamps before the first
transition that has a timestamp not less than -2**31.
Readers that support only 32-bit timestamps are likely to be
more prone to this problem, for example, when they process
64-bit transitions only some of which are representable in 32
bits.
As a partial workaround, a writer can output a dummy
transition at timestamp \&-2**31.
.It
Some readers mishandle a transition if its timestamp has
the minimum possible signed 64-bit value.
Timestamps less than \&-2**59 are not recommended.
.It
Some readers mishandle POSIX-style TZ strings that
contain
.Dq <
or
.Dq > .
As a partial workaround, a writer can avoid using
.Dq <
or
.Dq >
for time zone abbreviations containing only alphabetic
characters.
.Pp
Many readers mishandle time zone abbreviations that contain
non-ASCII characters.
These characters are not recommended.
.Pp
Some readers may mishandle time zone abbreviations that
contain fewer than 3 or more than 6 characters, or that
contain ASCII characters other than alphanumerics,
.Dq \&- .
and
.Dq + .
These abbreviations are not recommended.
.It
Some readers mishandle TZif files that specify
daylight-saving time UT offsets that are less than the UT
offsets for the corresponding standard time.
These readers do not support locations like Ireland, which
uses the equivalent of the POSIX TZ string
.Dq IST\&-1GMT0,M10.5.0,M3.5.0/1 ,
observing standard time
(IST, +01) in summer and daylight saving time (GMT, +00) in winter.
As a partial workaround, a writer can output data for the
equivalent of the POSIX TZ string
.Dq GMT0IST,M3.5.0/1,M10.5.0 ,
thus swapping standard and daylight saving time.
Although this workaround misidentifies which part of the year
uses daylight saving time, it records UT offsets and time zone
abbreviations correctly.
.El
.Pp
Some interoperability problems are reader bugs that
are listed here mostly as warnings to developers of readers.
.Bl -bullet
.It
Some readers do not support negative timestamps.
Developers of distributed applications should keep this
in mind if they need to deal with pre-1970 data.
.It
Some readers mishandle timestamps before the first
transition that has a nonnegative timestamp.
Readers that do not support negative timestamps are likely to
be more prone to this problem.
.It
+Some readers mishandle time zone abbreviations like
.Dq \&-08
that contain
.Dq + ,
.Dq \&- ,
or digits.
.It
Some readers mishandle UT offsets that are out of the
traditional range of \*-12 through +12 hours, and so do not
support locations like Kiritimati that are outside this
range.
.It
Some readers mishandle UT offsets in the range [\*-3599, \*-1]
seconds from UT, because they integer-divide the offset by
3600 to get 0 and then display the hour part as
.Dq +00 .
.It
Some readers mishandle UT offsets that are not a multiple
of one hour, or of 15 minutes, or of 1 minute.
Future changes to the format may append more data.
