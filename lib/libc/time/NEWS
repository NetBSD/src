News for the tz database

Release 2013i - 2013-12-17 07:25:23 -0800

  Changes affecting near-future time stamps:

    Jordan switches back to standard time at 00:00 on December 20, 2013.
    The 2006-2011 transition schedule is planned to resume in 2014.
    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

  Changes affecting past time stamps:

    In 2004, Cuba began DST on March 28, not April 4.
    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

  Changes affecting code

    The compile-time flag NOSOLAR has been removed, as nowadays the
    benefit of slightly shrinking runtime table size is outweighed by the
    cost of disallowing potential future updates that exceed old limits.

  Changes affecting documentation and commentary

    The files solar87, solar88, and solar89 are no longer distributed.
    They were a negative experiment -- that is, a demonstration that
    tz data can represent solar time only with some difficulty and error.
    Their presence in the distribution caused confusion, as Riyadh
    civil time was generally not solar time in those years.

    tz-link.htm now mentions Noda Time.  (Thanks to Matt Johnson.)

Release 2013h - 2013-10-25 15:32:32 -0700

  Changes affecting current and future time stamps:

    Libya has switched its time zone back to UTC+2 without DST,
    instead of UTC+1 with DST.  (Thanks to Even Scharning.)

    Western Sahara (Africa/El_Aaiun) uses Morocco's DST rules.
    (Thanks to Gwillim Law.)

  Changes affecting future time stamps:

    Acre and (we guess) western Amazonas will switch from UTC-4 to UTC-5
    on 2013-11-10.  This affects America/Rio_Branco and America/Eirunepe.
    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

    Add entries for DST transitions in Morocco in the year 2038.
    This avoids some year-2038 glitches introduced in 2013g.
    (Thanks to Yoshito Umaoka for reporting the problem.)

  Changes affecting API

    The 'tzselect' command no longer requires the 'select' command,
    and should now work with /bin/sh on more platforms.  It also works
    around a bug in BusyBox awk before version 1.21.0.  (Thanks to
    Patrick 'P. J.' McDermott.)

  Changes affecting code

    Fix localtime overflow bugs with 32-bit unsigned time_t.

    zdump no longer assumes sscanf returns maximal values on overflow.

  Changes affecting the build procedure

    The builder can specify which programs to use, if any, instead of
    'ar' and 'ranlib', and libtz.a is now built locally before being
    installed.  (Thanks to Michael Forney.)

    A dependency typo in the 'zdump' rule has been fixed.
    (Thanks to Andrew Paprocki.)

    The Makefile has been simplified by assuming that 'mkdir -p' and 'cp -f'
    work as specified by POSIX.2-1992 or later; this is portable nowadays.

    'make clean' no longer removes 'leapseconds', since it's
    host-independent and is part of the distribution.

    The unused makefile macros TZCSRCS, TZDSRCS, DATESRCS have been removed.

  Changes affecting documentation and commentary

    tz-link.htm now mentions TC TIMEZONE's draft timezone service protocol
    (thanks to Mike Douglass) and TimezoneJS.Date (thanks to Jim Fehrle).

    Update URLs in tz-link page.  Add URLs for Microsoft Windows, since
    8.1 introduces tz support.  Remove URLs for Tru64 and UnixWare (no
    longer maintained) and for old advisories.  SOFA now does C.

Release 2013g - 2013-09-30 21:08:26 -0700

  Changes affecting current and near-future time stamps

    Morocco now observes DST from the last Sunday in March to the last
    Sunday in October, not April to September respectively.  (Thanks
    to Steffen Thorsen.)

  Changes affecting 'zic'

    'zic' now runs on platforms that lack both hard links and symlinks.
    (Thanks to Theo Veenker for reporting the problem, for MinGW.)
    Also, fix some bugs on platforms that lack hard links but have symlinks.

    'zic -v' again warns that Asia/Tehran has no POSIX environment variable
    to predict the far future, fixing a bug introduced in 2013e.

  Changes affecting the build procedure

    The 'leapseconds' file is again put into the tzdata tarball.
    Also, 'leapseconds.awk', so tzdata is self-contained.  (Thanks to
    Matt Burgess and Ian Abbott.)  The timestamps of these and other
    dependent files in tarballs are adjusted more consistently.

  Changes affecting documentation and commentary

    The README file is now part of the data tarball as well as the code.
    It now states that files are public domain unless otherwise specified.
    (Thanks to Andrew Main (Zefram) for asking for clarifications.)
    Its details about the 1989 release moved to a place of honor near
    the end of NEWS.


Release 2013f - 2013-09-24 23:37:36 -0700

  Changes affecting near-future time stamps

    Tocantins will very likely not observe DST starting this spring.
    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

    Jordan will likely stay at UTC+3 indefinitely, and will not fall
    back this fall.

    Palestine will fall back at 00:00, not 01:00.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

  Changes affecting API

    The types of the global variables 'timezone' and 'altzone' (if present)
    have been changed back to 'long'.  This is required for 'timezone'
    by POSIX, and for 'altzone' by common practice, e.g., Solaris 11.
    These variables were originally 'long' in the tz code, but were
    mistakenly changed to 'time_t' in 1987; nobody reported the
    incompatibility until now.  The difference matters on x32, where
    'long' is 32 bits and 'time_t' is 64.  (Thanks to Elliott Hughes.)

  Changes affecting the build procedure

    Avoid long strings in leapseconds.awk to work around a mawk bug.
    (Thanks to Cyril Baurand.)

  Changes affecting documentation and commentary

    New file 'NEWS' that contains release notes like this one.

    Paraguay's law does not specify DST transition time; 00:00 is customary.
    (Thanks to Waldemar Villamayor-Venialbo.)

    Minor capitalization fixes.

  Changes affecting version-control only

    The experimental github repository now contains annotated and
    signed tags for recent releases, e.g., '2013e' for Release 2013e.
    Releases are tagged starting with 2012e; earlier releases were
    done differently, and tags would either not have a simple name or
    not exactly match what was released.

    'make set-timestamps' is now simpler and a bit more portable.


Release 2013e - 2013-09-19 23:50:04 -0700

  Changes affecting near-future time stamps

    This year Fiji will start DST on October 27, not October 20.
    (Thanks to David Wheeler for the heads-up.)  For now, guess that
    Fiji will continue to spring forward the Sunday before the fourth
    Monday in October.

  Changes affecting current and future time zone abbreviations

    Use WIB/WITA/WIT rather than WIT/CIT/EIT for alphabetic Indonesian
    time zone abbreviations since 1932.  (Thanks to George Ziegler,
    Priyadi Iman Nurcahyo, Zakaria, Jason Grimes, Martin Pitt, and
    Benny Lin.)  This affects Asia/Dili, Asia/Jakarta, Asia/Jayapura,
    Asia/Makassar, and Asia/Pontianak.

    Use ART (UTC-3, standard time), rather than WARST (also UTC-3, but
    daylight saving time) for San Luis, Argentina since 2009.

  Changes affecting Godthab time stamps after 2037 if version mismatch

    Allow POSIX-like TZ strings where the transition time's hour can
    range from -167 through 167, instead of the POSIX-required 0
    through 24.  E.g., TZ='FJT-12FJST,M10.3.1/146,M1.3.4/75' for the
    new Fiji rules.  This is a more-compact way to represent
    far-future time stamps for America/Godthab, America/Santiago,
    Antarctica/Palmer, Asia/Gaza, Asia/Hebron, Asia/Jerusalem,
    Pacific/Easter, and Pacific/Fiji.  Other zones are unaffected by
    this change.  (Derived from a suggestion by Arthur David Olson.)

    Allow POSIX-like TZ strings where daylight saving time is in
    effect all year.  E.g., TZ='WART4WARST,J1/0,J365/25' for Western
    Argentina Summer Time all year.  This supports a more-compact way
    to represent the 2013d data for America/Argentina/San_Luis.
    Because of the change for San Luis noted above this change does not
    affect the current data.  (Thanks to Andrew Main (Zefram) for
    suggestions that improved this change.)

    Where these two TZ changes take effect, there is a minor extension
    to the tz file format in that it allows new values for the
    embedded TZ-format string, and the tz file format version number
    has therefore been increased from 2 to 3 as a precaution.
    Version-2-based client code should continue to work as before for
    all time stamps before 2038.  Existing version-2-based client code
    (tzcode, GNU/Linux, Solaris) has been tested on version-3-format
    files, and typically works in practice even for time stamps after
    2037; the only known exception is America/Godthab.

  Changes affecting time stamps before 1970

    Pacific/Johnston is now a link to Pacific/Honolulu.  This corrects
    some errors before 1947.

    Some zones have been turned into links, when they differ from
    existing zones only in older data that was likely invented or that
    differs only in LMT or transition from LMT.  These changes affect
    only time stamps before 1943.  The affected zones are:
    Africa/Juba, America/Anguilla, America/Aruba, America/Dominica,
    America/Grenada, America/Guadeloupe, America/Marigot,
    America/Montserrat, America/St_Barthelemy, America/St_Kitts,
    America/St_Lucia, America/St_Thomas, America/St_Vincent,
    America/Tortola, and Europe/Vaduz.  (Thanks to Alois Treindl for
    confirming that the old Europe/Vaduz zone was wrong and the new
    link is better for WWII-era times.)

    Change Kingston Mean Time from -5:07:12 to -5:07:11.  This affects
    America/Cayman, America/Jamaica and America/Grand_Turk time stamps
    from 1890 to 1912.

    Change the UT offset of Bern Mean Time from 0:29:44 to 0:29:46.
    This affects Europe/Zurich time stamps from 1853 to 1894.  (Thanks
    to Alois Treindl).

    Change the date of the circa-1850 Zurich transition from 1849-09-12
    to 1853-07-16, overriding Shanks with data from Messerli about
    postal and telegraph time in Switzerland.

  Changes affecting time zone abbreviations before 1970

    For Asia/Jakarta, use BMT (not JMT) for mean time from 1923 to 1932,
    as Jakarta was called Batavia back then.

  Changes affecting API

    The 'zic' command now outputs a dummy transition when far-future
    data can't be summarized using a TZ string, and uses a 402-year
    window rather than a 400-year window.  For the current data, this
    affects only the Asia/Tehran file.  It does not affect any of the
    time stamps that this file represents, so zdump outputs the same
    information as before.  (Thanks to Andrew Main (Zefram).)

    The 'date' command has a new '-r' option, which lets you specify
    the integer time to display, a la FreeBSD.

    The 'tzselect' command has two new options '-c' and '-n', which lets you
    select a zone based on latitude and longitude.

    The 'zic' command's '-v' option now warns about constructs that
    require the new version-3 binary file format.  (Thanks to Arthur
    David Olson for the suggestion.)

    Support for floating-point time_t has been removed.
    It was always dicey, and POSIX no longer requires it.
    (Thanks to Eric Blake for suggesting to the POSIX committee to
    remove it, and thanks to Alan Barrett, Clive D.W. Feather, Andy
    Heninger, Arthur David Olson, and Alois Treindl, for reporting
    bugs and elucidating some of the corners of the old floating-point
    implementation.)

    The signatures of 'offtime', 'timeoff', and 'gtime' have been
    changed back to the old practice of using 'long' to represent UT
    offsets.  This had been inadvertently and mistakenly changed to
    'int_fast32_t'.  (Thanks to Christos Zoulos.)

    The code avoids undefined behavior on integer overflow in some
    more places, including gmtime, localtime, mktime and zdump.

  Changes affecting the zdump utility

    zdump now outputs "UT" when referring to Universal Time, not "UTC".
    "UTC" does not make sense for time stamps that predate the introduction
    of UTC, whereas "UT", a more-generic term, does.  (Thanks to Steve Allen
    for clarifying UT vs UTC.)

  Data changes affecting behavior of tzselect and similar programs

    Country code BQ is now called the more-common name "Caribbean Netherlands"
    rather than the more-official "Bonaire, St Eustatius & Saba".

    Remove from zone.tab the names America/Montreal, America/Shiprock,
    and Antarctica/South_Pole, as they are equivalent to existing
    same-country-code zones for post-1970 time stamps.  The data for
    these names are unchanged, so the names continue to work as before.

  Changes affecting code internals

    zic -c now runs way faster on 64-bit hosts when given large numbers.

    zic now uses vfprintf to avoid allocating and freeing some memory.

    tzselect now computes the list of continents from the data,
    rather than have it hard-coded.

    Minor changes pacify GCC 4.7.3 and GCC 4.8.1.

  Changes affecting the build procedure

    The 'leapseconds' file is now generated automatically from a
    new file 'leap-seconds.list', which is a copy of
    <ftp://time.nist.gov/pub/leap-seconds.list>.
    A new source file 'leapseconds.awk' implements this.
    The goal is simplification of the future maintenance of 'leapseconds'.

    When building the 'posix' or 'right' subdirectories, if the
    subdirectory would be a copy of the default subdirectory, it is
    now made a symbolic link if that is supported.  This saves about
    2 MB of file system space.

    The links America/Shiprock and Antarctica/South_Pole have been
    moved to the 'backward' file.  This affects only nondefault builds
    that omit 'backward'.

  Changes affecting version-control only

    .gitignore now ignores 'date'.

  Changes affecting documentation and commentary

    Changes to the 'tzfile' man page

      It now mentions that the binary file format may be extended in
      future versions by appending data.

      It now refers to the 'zdump' and 'zic' man pages.

    Changes to the 'zic' man page

      It lists conditions that elicit a warning with '-v'.

      It says that the behavior is unspecified when duplicate names
      are given, or if the source of one link is the target of another.

      Its examples are updated to match the latest data.

      The definition of white space has been clarified slightly.
      (Thanks to Michael Deckers.)

    Changes to the 'Theory' file

      There is a new section about the accuracy of the tz database,
      describing the many ways that errors can creep in, and
      explaining why so many of the pre-1970 time stamps are wrong or
      misleading (thanks to Steve Allen, Lester Caine, and Garrett
      Wollman for discussions that contributed to this).

      The 'Theory' file describes LMT better (this follows a
      suggestion by Guy Harris).

      It refers to the 2013 edition of POSIX rather than the 2004 edition.

      It's mentioned that excluding 'backward' should not affect the
      other data, and it suggests at least one zone.tab name per
      inhabited country (thanks to Stephen Colebourne).

      Some longstanding restrictions on names are documented, e.g.,
      'America/New_York' precludes 'America/New_York/Bronx'.

      It gives more reasons for the 1970 cutoff.

      It now mentions which time_t variants are supported, such as
      signed integer time_t.  (Thanks to Paul Goyette for reporting
      typos in an experimental version of this change.)

      (Thanks to Philip Newton for correcting typos in these changes.)

    Documentation and commentary is more careful to distinguish UT in
    general from UTC in particular.  (Thanks to Steve Allen.)

    Add a better source for the Zurich 1894 transition.
    (Thanks to Pierre-Yves Berger.)

    Update shapefile citations in tz-link.htm.  (Thanks to Guy Harris.)


Release 2013d - 2013-07-05 07:38:01 -0700

  Changes affecting future time stamps:

    Morocco's midsummer transitions this year are July 7 and August 10,
    not July 9 and August 8.  (Thanks to Andrew Paprocki.)

    Israel now falls back on the last Sunday of October.
    (Thanks to Ephraim Silverberg.)

  Changes affecting past time stamps:

    Specify Jerusalem's location more precisely; this changes the pre-1880
    times by 2 s.

  Changing affecting metadata only:

    Fix typos in the entries for country codes BQ and SX.

  Changes affecting code:

    Rework the code to fix a bug with handling Australia/Macquarie on
    32-bit hosts (thanks to Arthur David Olson).

    Port to platforms like NetBSD, where time_t can be wider than long.

    Add support for testing time_t types other than the system's.
    Run 'make check_time_t_alternatives' to try this out.
    Currently, the tests fail for unsigned time_t;
    this should get fixed at some point.

  Changes affecting documentation and commentary:

    Deemphasize the significance of national borders.

    Update the zdump man page.

    Remove obsolete NOID comment (thanks to Denis Excoffier).

    Update several URLs and comments in the web pages.

    Spelling fixes (thanks to Kevin Lyda and Jonathan Leffler).

    Update URL for CLDR Zone->Tzid table (thanks to Yoshito Umaoka).


Release 2013c - 2013-04-19 16:17:40 -0700

  Changes affecting current and future time stamps:

    Palestine observed DST starting March 29, 2013.  (Thanks to
    Steffen Thorsen.)  From 2013 on, Gaza and Hebron both observe DST,
    with the predicted rules being the last Thursday in March at 24:00
    to the first Friday on or after September 21 at 01:00.

    Assume that the recent change to Paraguay's DST rules is permanent,
    by moving the end of DST to the 4th Sunday in March every year.
    (Thanks to Carlos Raul Perasso.)

  Changes affecting past time stamps:

    Fix some historical data for Palestine to agree with that of
    timeanddate.com, as follows:

	  The spring 2008 change in Gaza and Hebron was on 00:00 Mar 28, not
	  00:00 Apr 1.

	  The fall 2009 change in Gaza and Hebron on Sep 4 was at 01:00, not
	  02:00.

	  The spring 2010 change in Hebron was 00:00 Mar 26, not 00:01 Mar 27.

	  The spring 2011 change in Gaza was 00:01 Apr 1, not 12:01 Apr 2.

	  The spring 2011 change in Hebron on Apr 1 was at 00:01, not 12:01.

	  The fall 2011 change in Hebron on Sep 30 was at 00:00, not 03:00.

    Fix times of habitation for Macquarie to agree with the Tasmania
    Parks & Wildlife Service history, which indicates that permanent
    habitation was 1899-1919 and 1948 on.

  Changing affecting metadata only:

    Macquarie Island is politically part of Australia, not Antarctica.
    (Thanks to Tobias Conradi.)

    Sort Macquarie more-consistently with other parts of Australia.
    (Thanks to Tim Parenti.)


Release 2013b - 2013-03-10 22:33:40 -0700

  Changes affecting current and future time stamps:

    Haiti uses US daylight-saving rules this year, and presumably future years.
    This changes time stamps starting today.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

    Paraguay will end DST on March 24 this year.
    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)  For now, assume it's just this year.

    Morocco does not observe DST during Ramadan;
    try to predict Ramadan in Morocco as best we can.
    (Thanks to Erik Homoet for the heads-up.)

  Changes affecting commentary:

    Update URLs in tz-link page.  Add URLs for webOS, BB10, iOS.
    Update URL for Solaris.  Mention Internet RFC 6557.
    Update Internet RFCs 2445->5545, 2822->5322.
    Switch from FTP to HTTP for Internet RFCs.


Release 2013a - 2013-02-27 09:20:35 -0800

  Change affecting binary data format:

    The zone offset at the end of version-2-format zone files is now
    allowed to be 24:00, as per POSIX.1-2008.  (Thanks to Arthor David Olson.)

  Changes affecting current and future time stamps:

    Chile's 2013 rules, and we guess rules for 2014 and later, will be
    the same as 2012, namely Apr Sun>=23 03:00 UTC to Sep Sun>=2 04:00 UTC.
    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen and Robert Elz.)

    New Zones Asia/Khandyga, Asia/Ust-Nera, Europe/Busingen.
    (Thanks to Tobias Conradi and Arthur David Olson.)

  Many changes affect historical time stamps before 1940.
  These were deduced from: Milne J. Civil time. Geogr J. 1899
  Feb;13(2):173-94 <http://www.jstor.org/stable/1774359>.

  Changes affecting the code:

    Fix zic bug that mishandled Egypt's 2010 changes (this also affected
    the data).  (Thanks to Arthur David Olson.)

    Fix localtime bug when time_t is unsigned and data files were generated
    by a signed time_t system.  (Thanks to Doug Bailey for reporting and
    to Arthur David Olson for fixing.)

    Allow the email address for bug reports to be set by the packager.
    The default is tz@iana.org, as before.  (Thanks to Joseph S. Myers.)

    Update HTML checking to be compatible with Ubuntu 12.10.

    Check that files are a safe subset of ASCII.  At some point we may
    relax this requirement to a safe subset of UTF-8.  Without the
    check, some non-UTF-8 encodings were leaking into the distribution.

  Commentary changes:

    Restore a comment about copyright notices that was inadvertently deleted.
    (Thanks to Arthur David Olson.)

    Improve the commentary about which districts observe what times
    in Russia.  (Thanks to Oscar van Vlijmen and Arthur David Olson).

    Add web page links to tz.js.

    Add "Run by the Monkeys" to tz-art.  (Thanks to Arthur David Olson.)


Release 2012j - 2012-11-12 18:34:49 -0800

  Libya moved to CET this weekend, but with DST planned next year.
  (Thanks to Even Scharning, Steffen Thorsen, and Tim Parenti.)

  Signatures now have the extension .asc, not .sign, as that's more
  standard.  (Thanks to Phil Pennock.)

  The output of 'zdump --version', and of 'zic --version', now
  uses a format that is more typical for --version.
  (Thanks to Joseph S. Myers.)

  The output of 'tzselect --help', 'zdump --help', and 'zic --help'
  now uses tz@iana.org rather than the old elsie address.

  zic -v now complains about abbreviations that are less than 3
  or more than 6 characters, as per Posix.  Formerly, it checked
  for abbreviations that were more than 3.

  'make public' no longer puts its temporary directory under /tmp,
  and uses the just-built zic rather than the system zic.

  Various fixes to documentation and commentary.


Release 2012i - 2012-11-03 12:57:09 -0700

  Cuba switches from DST tomorrow at 01:00.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

  Linker flags can now be specified via LDFLAGS.
  AWK now defaults to 'awk', not 'nawk'.
  The shell in tzselect now defaults to /bin/bash, but this can
  be overridden by specifying KSHELL.
  The main web page now mentions the unofficial github repository.
  (Thanks to Mike Frysinger.)

  Tarball signatures can now be built by running 'make signatures'.
  There are also new makefile rules 'tarballs', 'check_public', and
  separate makefile rules for each tarball and signature file.
  A few makefile rules are now more portable to strict POSIX.

  The main web page now lists the canonical IANA URL.


Release 2012h - 2012-10-26 22:49:10 -0700

  Bahia no longer has DST.  (Thanks to Kelley Cook.)

  Tocantins has DST.  (Thanks to Rodrigo Severo.)

  Israel has new DST rules next year.  (Thanks to Ephraim Silverberg.)

  Jordan stays on DST this winter.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

  Web page updates.

  More C modernization, except that at Arthur David Olson's suggestion
  the instances of 'register' were kept.


Release 2012g - 2012-10-17 20:59:45 -0700

  Samoa fall 2012 and later.  (Thanks to Nicholas Pereira and Robert Elz.)

  Palestine fall 2012.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

  Assume C89.

  To attack the version-number problem, this release ships the file
  'Makefile' (which contains the release number) in both the tzcode and
  the tzdata tarballs.  The two Makefiles are identical, and should be
  identical in any matching pair of tarballs, so it shouldn't matter
  which order you extract the tarballs.  Perhaps we can come up with a
  better version-number scheme at some point; this scheme does have the
  virtue of not adding more files.


Release 2012f - 2012-09-12 23:17:03 -0700

  * australasia (Pacific/Fiji): Fiji DST is October 21 through January
    20 this year.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)


Release 2012e - 2012-08-02 20:44:55 -0700

  * australasia (Pacific/Fakaofo): Tokelau is UTC+13, not UTC+14.
    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

  * Use a single version number for both code and data.

  * .gitignore: New file.

  * Remove trailing white space.


Release code2012c-data2012d - 2012-07-19 16:35:33 -0700

  Changes for Morocco's time stamps, which take effect in a couple of
  hours, along with infrastructure changes to accommodate how the tz
  code and data are released on IANA.


Release data2012c - 2012-03-27 12:17:25 -0400

  africa
	Summer time changes for Morocco (to start late April 2012)

  asia
	Changes for 2012 for Gaza & the West Bank (Hebron) and Syria

  northamerica
	Haiti following US/Canada rules for 2012 (and we're assuming,
	for now anyway, for the future).


Release 2012b - 2012-03-02 12:29:15 +0700

  There is just one change to tzcode2012b (compared with 2012a):
  the Makefile that was accidentally included with 2012a has been
  replaced with the version that should have been there, which is
  identical with the previous version (from tzcode2011i).

  There are just two changes in tzdata2012b compared with 2012a.

  Most significantly, summer time in Cuba has been delayed 3 weeks
  (now starts April 1 rather than March 11).   Since Mar 11 (the old start
  date, as listed in 2012a) is just a little over a week away, this
  change is urgent.

  Less importantly, an excess tab in one of the changes in zone.tab
  in 2012a has been removed.


Release 2012a - 2012-03-01 18:28:10 +0700

  The changes in tzcode2012a (compared to the previous version, 2011i)
  are entirely to the README and tz-art.htm and tz-link.htm files, if
  none of those concern you, you can ignore the code update.  The changes
  reflect the changed addresses for the mailing list and the code and
  data distribution points & methods (and a link to DateTime::TimeZone::Tzfile
  has been added to tz-link.htm).

  In tzdata2012a (compared to the previous release, which was 2011n)
  the major changes are:
	Chile 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 summer time date adjustments.
	Falkland Islands onto permanent summer time (we're assuming for the
		foreseeable future, though 2012 is all we're fairly certain of.)
	Armenia has abolished Summer Time.
	Tokelau jumped the International Date Line back last December
		(just the same as their near neighbour, Samoa).
	America/Creston is a new zone for a small area of British Columbia
	There will be a leapsecond 2012-06-30 23:59:60 UTC.

  Other minor changes are:
	Corrections to 1918 Canadian summer time end dates.
	Updated URL for UK timezone history (in comments)
	A few typos in Le Corre's list of free French place names (comments)


Release data2011n - 2011-10-30 14:57:54 +0700

  There are three changes of note - most urgently, Cuba (America/Havana)
  has extended summer time by two weeks, now to end on Nov 13, rather than
  the (already past) Oct 30.   Second, the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic
  (Europe/Tiraspol) decided not to split from the rest of Moldova after
  all, and consequently that zone has been removed (again) and reinstated
  in the "backward" file as a link to Europe/Chisinau.   And third, the
  end date for Fiji's summer time this summer was moved forward from the
  earlier planned Feb 26, to Jan 22.

  Apart from that, Moldova (MD) returns to a single entry in zone.tab
  (and the incorrect syntax that was in the 2011m version of that file
  is so fixed - it would have been fixed in a different way had this
  change not happened - that's the "missing" sccs version id).


Release data2011m - 2011-10-24 21:42:16 +0700

  In particular, the typos in comments in the data (2011-11-17 should have
  been 2011-10-17 as Alan Barrett noted, and spelling of Tiraspol that
  Tim Parenti noted) have been fixed, and the change for Ukraine has been
  made in all 4 Ukrainian zones, rather than just Kiev (again, thanks to
  Tim Parenti, and also Denys Gavrysh)

  In addition, I added Europe/Tiraspol to zone.tab.

  This time, all the files have new version numbers...  (including the files
  otherwise unchanged in 2011m that were changed in 2011l but didn't get new
  version numbers there...)


Release data2011l -  2011-10-10 11:15:43 +0700

  There are just 2 changes that cause different generated tzdata files from
  zic, to Asia/Hebron and Pacific/Fiji - the possible change for Bahia, Brazil
  is included, but commented out.  Compared with the diff I sent out last week,
  this version also includes attributions for the sources for the changes
  (in much the same format as ado used, but the html tags have not been
  checked, verified, or used in any way at all, so if there are errors there,
  please let me know.)

  zic/multiprocessor/directory-creation situation.


Release 1997a - 1997-01-21 09:11:10 -0500

  Paul Eggert's Antarctica (and other changes)

  Arthur David Olson finessed the "getopt" issue by checking against
  both -1 and EOF (regardless of POSIX, SunOS 4.1.1's manual says -1
  is returned while SunOS 5.5's manual says EOF is returned).


Release code1996o-data1996n - 1996-12-27 21:42:05 -0500

  Paul Eggert's latest changes


Release code1996n - 1996-12-16 09:42:02 -0500

Release data1996m - 1996-11-24 02:37:34 -0000

  Paul Eggert's batch of changes


Release code1996m-data1996l - 1996-11-05 14:00:12 -0500

  make more use of ISO style dates in comments. The names of the above
  files now include the year in full.


Release code96l - 1996-09-08 17:12:20 -0400

  tzcode96k was missing a couple of pieces.

  Paul's suggested patch for strftime %V week numbers


Release data96i - 1996-07-01 18:13:04 -0400

  "northamerica" and "europe" changes by Paul Eggert


Release code96h - 1996-06-05 08:02:21 -0400

  fix for handling transitions specified in Universal Time

  Some "public domain" notices have also been added.


Release code96g - 1996-05-16 14:00:26 -0400

  fix for the simultaneous-DST-and-zone-change challenge


Release data96h - 1996-05-09 17:40:51-0400

  changes by Paul Eggert


Release code96f-data96g - 1996-05-03 03:09:59 -0000
  [tzcode96f.tar.gz + tzdata96g.tar.gz are both missing!]

  The changes get us some of the way to fixing the problems noted in Paul
  Eggert's letter yesterday (in addition to a few others).  The approach
  has been to make zic a bit smarter about figuring out what time zone
  abbreviations apply just after the time specified in the "UNTIL" part
  of a zone line.  Putting the smarts in zic means avoiding having
  transition times show up in both "Zone" lines and "Rule" lines, which
  in turn avoids multiple transition time entries in time zone files.
  (This also makes the zic input files such as "europe" a bit shorter and
  should ease maintenance.)


Release data96f - 1996-04-19 19:20:03 -0000
  [tzdata96f.tar.gz is missing!]

  The only changes are to the "northamerica" file; the time zone
  abbreviation for Denver is corrected to MST (and MDT), and the
  comments for Mexico have been updated.

  Proposals by Paul Eggert, in particular the Portugal change that
  comes into play at the end of this month.

  Israel updates

  fixes to strftime.c for correct ISO 8601 week number generation,
  plus support for two new formats ('G' and 'g') to give ISO 8601 year

  A simplification of a macro definition, a change to data for Sudan,
  and (for last minute shoppers) notes in the "Music" file on the CD

  European cleanups

  support for 64-bit time_t's

  optimization in localtime.c


Release code95e - 1995-10-13 13:23:57 -0400

  offsets


Release data95i - 1995-09-26 10:43:26 -0400

  For Canada/Central, guess that the Sun customer's ``one week too
  early'' was just a approximation, and the true error is one month
  too early.  This is consistent with the rest of Canada.


Release data95h - 1995-09-21 11:26:48 -0400

  latest changes from Paul Eggert


Release code95d - 1995-09-14 11:14:45 -0400

  Paul Eggert's change to the australasia file


Release data95e - 1995-07-08 18:02:34 -0400

  The only change is a leap second at the end of this year.
  Thanks to Bradley White for forwarding news on the leap second.


Release data95d - 1995-07-03 13:26:22 -0400

  Paul Eggert's changes


Release data95c - 1995-07-02 19:19:28 -0400

  changes to "asia", "backward", "europe", and "southamerica"
  (read: northamericacentrics need not apply)


Release code95c - 1995-03-13 14:00:46 -0500

  one-line fix for sign extension problems in detzcode


Release 95b - 1995-03-04 11:22:38 -0500

  Minor changes in both:

  The "code" file contains a workaround for the lack of "unistd.h" in
  Microsoft C++ version 7.

  The "data" file contains a fixed "Link" for America/Shiprock.


Release 94h - 1994-12-10 12:51:14 -0500

  The files:

  *	incorporate the changes to "zdump" and "date" to make changes to
	the "TZ" environment variable permanent;

  *	incorporate the table changes by Paul Eggert;

  *	include (and document) support for universal time specifications in
	data files--but do not (yet) include use of this feature in the
	data files.

  Think of this as "TZ Classic"--the software has been set up not to break if
  universal time shows up in its input, and the data has been left as is so as
  not to break existing implementations.


Release data94f - 1994-08-20 12:56:09 -0400

  (with thanks!) the latest data updates from Paul Eggert


Release data94e - 1994-06-04 13:13:53 -0400

Release code94f - 1994-05-05 13:00:33 -0000
  [tzcode94f.tar.gz is missing!]

  changes to avoid overflow in difftime, as well as changes to cope
  with the 52/53 challenge in strftime


Release code94e - 1994-03-30 23:32:59 -0500

  change for the benefit of PCTS


Release 94d - 1994-02-24 15:42:25 -0500

  Avoid clashes with POSIX semantics for zones such as GMT+4.

  Some other very minor housekeeping is also present.


Release code94c - 1994-02-10 08:52:40 -0500

  Fix bug where mkdirs was broken unless you compile with
  -fwritable-strings (which is generally losing to do).


Release 94b - 1994-02-07 10:04:33 -0500

  work by Paul Eggert who notes:

  I found another book of time zone histories by E W Whitman; it's not
  as extensive as Shanks but has a few goodies of its own.  I used it
  to update the tables.  I also fixed some more as a result of
  correspondence with Adam David and Peter Ilieve, and move some stray
  links from `europe' to `backward'.  I corrected some scanning errors
  in usno1989.

  As far as the code goes, I fixed zic to allow years in the range
  INT_MIN to INT_MAX; this fixed a few boundary conditions around 1900.
  And I cleaned up the zic documentation a little bit.


Release data94a - 1994-02-03 08:58:54 -0500

  It simply incorporates the recently announced leap second into the
  "leapseconds" file.


Release 93g - 1993-11-22 17:28:27 -0500

  Paul Eggert has provided a good deal of historic information (based
  on Shanks), and there are some code changes to deal with the buglets
  that crawled out in dealing with the new information.


Release 93f - 1993-10-15 12:27:46 -0400

  Paul Eggert's changes


Release 93e - 1993-09-05 21:21:44 -0400

  There's updated data for Israel, England, and Kwajalein; there's
  also an update to "zdump" to cope with Kwajalein's 24-hour jump.
  Thanks to Paul Eggert and Peter Ilieve for the changes.


Release 93d - 1993-06-17 23:34:17 -0400

  new fix and new data on Israel


Release 93c - 1993-06-06 19:31:55 -0400

  [not summarized]


Release 93b - 1993-02-02 14:53:58 -0500

  updated "leapseconds" file


Release 93 - 1993-01-08 07:01:06 -0500

  At kre's suggestion, the package has been split in two--a code piece
  (which also includes documentation) that's only of use to folks who
  want to recompile things and a data piece useful to anyone who can
  run "zic".

  The new version has a few changes to the data files, a few
  portability changes, and an off-by-one fix (with thanks to
  Tom-Karzes at deshaw.com for providing a description and a
  solution).


Release 92c - 1992-11-21 17:35:36 -0000
  [tz92c.tar.Z is missing!]

  The fallout from the latest round of DST transitions.

  There are changes for Portugal, Saskatchewan, and "Pacific-New";
  there's also a change to "zic.c" that makes it portable to more systems.


Release 92 - 1992-04-25 18:17:03 -0000
  [tz92.tar.Z is missing!]

  By popular demand (well, at any rate, following a request by kre at munnari)


The 1989 update of the time zone package featured:

  *	POSIXization (including interpretation of POSIX-style TZ environment
	variables, provided by Guy Harris),
  *	ANSIfication (including versions of "mktime" and "difftime"),
  *	SVIDulation (an "altzone" variable)
  *	MACHination (the "gtime" function)
  *	corrections to some time zone data (including corrections to the rules
	for Great Britain and New Zealand)
  *	reference data from the United States Naval Observatory for folks who
	want to do additional time zones
  *	and the 1989 data for Saudi Arabia.

  (Since this code will be treated as "part of the implementation" in some
  places and as "part of the application" in others, there's no good way to
  name functions, such as timegm, that are not part of the proposed ANSI C
  standard; such functions have kept their old, underscore-free names in this
  update.)

  And the "dysize" function has disappeared; it was present to allow
  compilation of the "date" command on old BSD systems, and a version of "date"
  is now provided in the package.  The "date" command is not created when you
  "make all" since it may lack options provided by the version distributed with
  your operating system, or may not interact with the system in the same way
  the native version does.

  Since POSIX frowns on correct leap second handling, the default behavior of
  the "zic" command (in the absence of a "-L" option) has been changed to omit
  leap second information from its output files.

Notes

This file contains copies of the part of each release announcement
that talks about the changes in that release.  The text has been
adapted and reformatted for the purposes of this file.

Typically a release R consists of a pair of tarball files,
tzcodeR.tar.gz and tzdataR.tar.gz.  However, some releases (e.g.,
code2010a, data2012c) consist of just one or the other tarball, and a
few (e.g., code2012c-data2012d) have tarballs with mixed version
numbers.

Release time stamps are taken from the release's commit (for newer,
git releases), from the newest file in the tarball (for older
releases, where this info is available) or from the email announcing
the release (if all else fails; these are marked with a timezone of
-0000 and an "is missing!" comment).

Earlier versions of the code and data were not announced on the tz
list and are not summarized here.
