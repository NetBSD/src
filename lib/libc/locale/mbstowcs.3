.Nm mbstowcs
.Nd converts a multibyte character string to a wide character string

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <stdlib.h>
.Ft size_t
.Fn mbstowcs "wchar_t * restrict pwcs" "const char * restrict s" "size_t n"
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn mbstowcs
converts a null-terminated multibyte character string pointed by
.Fa s
to the corresponding wide character string and stores it to the array
pointed by
.Fa pwcs .
This function may modify the first at most
.Fa n
elements of the array pointed by
.Fa pwcs .
Each characters will be converted as if
.Xr mbtowc 3
is continuously called, except the internal state of
.Xr mbtowc 3
will not be affected.
.Pp
For state-dependent encoding, the
.Fn mbstowcs
implies the multibyte character string pointed by
.Fa s
always to begin with an initial state.
.Pp
There are special cases:
.Bl -tag -width 012345678901
.It pwcs == NULL
The
.Fn mbstowcs
returns the number of elements to store the whole wide character string
corresponding to the multibyte character string pointed by
.Fa s .
In this case,
.Fa n
is ignored.
.It s == NULL
undefined (may causes the program to crash).
.El
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn mbstowcs
returns:
.Bl -tag -width 012345678901
.It 0
.Fa s
points a null byte (\'\\0\').
.It positive
Number of elements stored to the array pointed by
.Fa pwcs .
There is no cases that the value returned is greater than
.Fa n
(unless
.Fa pwcs
is a null pointer) or the value of MB_CUR_MAX macro.
If the return value is equal to
.Fa n ,
the string pointed by
.Fa pwcs
will not be null-terminated.
.It (size_t)-1
.Fa s
points the string containing invalid or incomplete multibyte character.
The
.Fn mbstowcs
also sets errno to indicate the error.
.El
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn mbstowcs
may causes an error in the following case:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EILSEQ
.Fa s
points the string containing invalid or incomplete multibyte character.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn mbstowcs
function conforms to
.St -ansiC .
The restrict qualifier is added at
.St -isoC99 .
