.Sh NAME
.Nm sctp_getpaddrs ,
.Nm sctp_getladdrs
.Nd return a list of addresses to the caller
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/socket.h
.In netinet/sctp.h
.Ft int
.Fn sctp_getpaddrs "int s" "sctp_assoc_t asocid" "struct sockaddr **addrs"
.Ft int
.Fn sctp_getladdrs "int s" "sctp_assoc_t asocid" "struct sockaddr **addrs"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn sctp_getpaddrs
function is used to get the list of the peers addresses.
The
.Fn sctp_getladdrs
function is used to get the list of the local addresses.
The association of interest is identified by the
.Fa asocid
argument.
The addresses are returned in a newly allocated
array of socket addresses returned in the argument
.Fa addrs
upon success.
.Pp
After the caller is finished, the function
.Xr sctp_freepaddrs 3
or
.Xr sctp_freeladdrs 3
should be used to release the memory allocated by these
calls.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The call returns \-1 upon failure and a count of
the number of addresses returned in
.Fa addrs
upon success.
.Sh ERRORS
The functions can return the following errors:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EBADF
The argument
.Fa s
is not a valid descriptor.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
An address listed has an invalid family or no
addresses were provided.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
The call cannot allocate memory to hold the
socket addresses.
.It Bq Er ENOTSOCK
The argument
.Fa s
is not a socket.
