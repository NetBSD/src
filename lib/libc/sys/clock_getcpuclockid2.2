.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm clock_getcpuclockid2
.Nd retrieve the clock id of a process or lwp
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In time.h
.Ft int
.Fn clock_getcpuclockid2 "idtype_t idtype" "id_t id" "clockid_t *clock_id"
.Ft int
.Fn clock_getcpuclockid "pid_t pid" "clockid_t *clock_id"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn cpu_getcpuclockid2
function retrieves the
.Fa clock_id
for the specified
.Fa id
and
.Fa idtype.
Supported
.Fa idtypes
are:
.Bl -tag -width P_LWPID
.It Dv P_PID
The specified process id or
.Dv 0
for the current process.
.It Dv P_LWPID
The specified LWP id or
.Dv 0
for the current LWP.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn clock_getcpuclockid
function is equivalent to calling
.Fn clock_getcpuclockid2
with
.Fa idtype
.Dv P_PID
and
.Fa id
.Fa pid .
.Pp
The
.Xr clock_gettime 2
function can be used with the returned
.Fa clock_id
to retrieve process and LWP times.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn clock_getcpuclockid
and
.Fn clock_getcpuclockid2
functions succeed and return 0, placing the requested
.Fa clock_id 
in the argument.
On error, the value \-1 is returned
and the value of
.Va errno
is set to reflect what went wrong.
.Sh ERRORS
These functions fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
An unsuppored
.Fa idtype
was supplied.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr clock_gettime 2
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn clock_getcpuclockid
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2001 .
The
.Fn clock_getcpuclockid2
is a
.Nx
extension.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn clock_getcpuclockid
and
.Fn clock_getcpuclockid2
functions appeared in
.Nx 8 .
