.Dt MOUNT 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mount ,
.Nm unmount
.Nd mount or dismount a file system
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include \*[Lt]sys/param.h\*[Gt]
.Fd #include \*[Lt]sys/mount.h\*[Gt]
.Ft int
.Fn mount "const char *type" "const char *dir" "int flags" "void *data"
.Ft int
.Fn unmount "const char *dir" "int flags"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn mount
function grafts
a file system object onto the system file tree
at the point
.Ar dir .
The argument
.Ar data
describes the file system object to be mounted.
The argument
.Ar type
tells the kernel how to interpret
.Ar data
(See
.Ar type
below).
The contents of the file system
become available through the new mount point
.Ar dir .
Any files in
.Ar dir
at the time
of a successful mount are swept under the carpet so to speak, and
are unavailable until the file system is unmounted.
.Pp
The following
.Ar flags
may be specified to
suppress default semantics which affect file system access.
.Bl -tag -width MNT_SYNCHRONOUS
.It Dv MNT_RDONLY
The file system should be treated as read-only;
Even the super-user may not write on it.
.It Dv MNT_NOEXEC
Do not allow files to be executed from the file system.
.It Dv MNT_NOSUID
Do not honor setuid or setgid bits on files when executing them.
.It Dv MNT_NODEV
Do not interpret special files on the file system.
.It Dv MNT_UNION
Union with underlying filesystem instead of obscuring it.
.It Dv MNT_SYNCHRONOUS
All I/O to the file system should be done synchronously.
.It Dv MNT_ASYNC
All I/O to the file system should be done asynchronously.
.It Dv MNT_NOCOREDUMP
Do not allow programs to dump core files on the file system.
.It Dv MNT_NOATIME
Never update access time in the file system.
.It Dv MNT_SYMPERM
Recognize the permission of symbolic link when reading or traversing.
.It Dv MNT_NODEVMTIME
Never update modification time of device files.
.It Dv MNT_SOFTDEP
Use soft dependencies.
.El
.Pp
The flag
.Dv MNT_UPDATE
indicates that the mount command is being applied
to an already mounted file system.
This allows the mount flags to be changed without requiring
that the file system be unmounted and remounted.
Some file systems may not allow all flags to be changed.
For example,
most file systems will not allow a change from read-write to read-only.
.Pp
The
.Fa type
argument defines the type of the file system.
The types of file systems known to the system are defined in
.Aq Pa sys/mount.h .
.\" XXX from lite-2:
.\" The types of filesystems known to the system can be obtained with
.\" .Xr sysctl 8
.\" by using the command:
.\" .Bd -literal -offset indent
.\" sysctl vfs
.\" .Ed
.\" .Pp
.Fa data
is a pointer to a structure that contains the type
specific arguments to mount.
The currently supported types of file systems and
their type specific data are:

struct ufs_args {
      char      *fspec;             /* block special file to mount */

.\" XXX from lite-2:
.\" The format for these argument structures is described in the
.\" manual page for each filesystem.
.\" By convention filesystem manual pages are named
.\" by prefixing ``mount_'' to the name of the filesystem as returned by
.\" .Xr sysctl 8 .
.\" Thus the
.\" .Nm NFS
.\" filesystem is described by the
.\" .Xr mount_nfs 8
.\" manual page.
.Pp
The
.Fn unmount
function call disassociates the file system from the specified
mount point
.Fa dir .
.Pp
The
.Fa flags
argument may specify
.Dv MNT_FORCE
to specify that the file system should be forcibly unmounted even if files are
still active.
Active special devices continue to work,
but any further accesses to any other active files result in errors
even if the file system is later remounted.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn mount
returns the value 0 if the mount was successful, otherwise -1 is returned
and the variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Pp
.Fn unmount
returns the value 0 if the unmount succeeded; otherwise -1 is returned
and the variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn mount
will fail when one of the following occurs:
