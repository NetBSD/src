.Sh NAME
.Nm lsearch ,
.Nm lfind
.Nd linear search and update
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <search.h>
.Ft void *
.Fn lsearch "void *key" "void *base" "size_t *nelp" "size_t width" "int (*compar)(const void *, const void *)"
.Ft void *
.Fn lfind "void *key" "void *base" "size_t *nelp" "size_t width" "int (*compar)(const void *, const void *)"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn Lsearch 
is a linear search. 
If the entry is not found, it is added to the end of the table.
.Pp
.Fa Key 
points to the entry to be searched for.
.Fa Base
points to the first element of the table.
.Fa Nelp
points to an integer containing the number of elements in the table.
The integer is incremented whenever an entry is added.
.Fa Width
is the size of an element in bytes.
The user supplied comparison function
.Fa compar
is called with two arguments that point to the elements being compared.
The comparison function must return zero if the elements are equal and non-zero
if they are not.
.Pp
.Fn Lfind
is the same as 
.Fn lsearch ,
except if the entry is not found, it is not added to the table.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn Lsearch
and 
.Fn lfind
return a pointer to the entry if it was found.
Otherwise, 
.Fn lsearch
returns a pointer to the newly added element, and
.Fn lfind
returns a
.Dv NULL
pointer.
