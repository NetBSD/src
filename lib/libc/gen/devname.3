.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.In sys/stat.h
.Ft char *
.Fn devname "dev_t dev" "mode_t type"
.Ft int
.Fn devname_r "dev_t dev" "mode_t type" "char *path" "size_t len"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn devname
function returns a pointer to the static buffer with the name of the
block or character device in
.Dq Pa /dev
with a device number of
.Fa dev ,
and a file type matching the one encoded in
.Fa type
which must be one of S_IFBLK or S_IFCHR.
If no device matches the specified values, or no information is
available,
.Dv NULL
is returned.
.Pp
The
.Fn devname_r
function is a reentrant and thread-safe version of
.Fn devname .
This function returns the device name by copying it into the
.Fa path
argument with up to
.Fa len
characters.
The
.Fa path
argument is always nul-terminated.
.Pp
The traditional display for applications when no device is
found is the string
.Dq ?? .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful,
.Fn devname
returns a pointer to a nul-terminated string containing the name of the device.
If an error occurs
.Fa devname
will return
.Dv NULL .
.Pp
If successful,
.Fn devname_r
places a nul-terminated string containing the name of the device in
the buffer pointed to by
.Ar path
and returns 0.
If an error occurs
.Fn devname_r
will return an error number from
.In sys/errno.h
indicating what went wrong.
