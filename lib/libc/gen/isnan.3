.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In math.h
.Ft int
.Fn isnan "real-floating x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn isnan
macro determines whether its argument
.Fa x
is not-a-number
.Pq Dq NaN .
An argument represented in a format wider than its semantic type is
converted to its semantic type first.
The determination is then based on the type of the argument.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn isnan
macro returns a non-zero value if the value of
.Fa x
is a NaN.
Otherwise 0 is returned.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn isnan
macro conforms to
.St -isoC-99 .
.Sh CAVEATS
On VAX the
.Fn isnan
function always returns 0,
as the architecture doesn't support NaN.
