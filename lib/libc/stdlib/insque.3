.Sh NAME
.Nm insque ,
.Nm remque
.Nd insert/remove element from a queue
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In search.h
.Ft void
.Fn insque "void *elem" "void *pred"
.Ft void
.Fn remque "void *elem"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn insque
and
.Fn remque
manipulate queues built from doubly linked lists.
The queue can be either circular or linear.
The functions expect their
arguments to point to a structure whose first and second members are
pointers to the next and previous element, respectively.
The
.Fn insque
function also allows the
.Fa pred
argument to be a
.Dv NULL
pointer for the initialization of a new linear list's
head element.
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn insque
and
.Fn remque
functions conform to
.St -p1003.1-2001 .
.Sh HISTORY
These are derived from the insque and remque instructions on a VAX.
