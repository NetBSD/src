.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm strsuftoll ,
.Nm strsuftollx
.Nd "convert a string to a long long, with suffix parsing"
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.Ft long long
.Fn strsuftoll "const char *desc" "const char *val" "long long min" "long long max"
.Ft long long
.Fn strsuftollx "const char *desc" "const char *val" "long long min" "long long max" "char *errbuf" "size_t errbuflen"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The functions
.Fn strsuftoll
and
.Fn strsuftollx
convert
.Fa val
into a long long number,
checking that the result is not smaller than
.Fa min
or larger than
.Fa max .
Two or more decimal numbers may be separated by an
.Dq x
to indicate a product.
Each decimal number may have one of the following optional suffixes:
.Bl -tag -width 3n -offset indent -compact
.It b
Block; multiply by 512
.It k
Kibi; multiply by 1024 (1 KiB)
.It m
Mebi; multiply by 1048576 (1 MiB)
.It g
Gibi; multiply by 1073741824 (1 GiB)
.It t
Tebi; multiply by 1099511627776 (1 TiB)
.It w
Word; multiply by the number of bytes in an integer
.El
.Pp
In the case of an error (range overflow or an invalid number),
.Fn strsuftollx
places an error message into
.Fa errbuf
(which is
.Fa errbuflen
bytes long) and returns 0,
and
.Fn strsuftoll
displays that error and terminates the process.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The functions
.Fn strsuftoll
and
.Fn strsuftollx
return either the result of the conversion,
unless the value overflows or is not a number;
in the latter case,
.Fn strsuftoll
displays an error message and terminates the process with exit code 1,
and
.Fn strsuftollx
returns with 0 and
.Fa errbuf
contains a non-empty error message.
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ERANGE
The given string was out of range; the value converted has been clamped.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr errx 3 ,
.Xr strtoll 3
.Sh BUGS
Ignores the current locale.
