.Sh NAME
.Nm mq_unlink
.Nd remove a message queue (REALTIME)
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb librt
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In mqueue.h
.Ft int
.Fn mq_unlink "const char *name"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn mq_unlink
function removes the message queue named by the pathname
.Fa name .
After a successful call to
.Fn mq_unlink
with
.Fa name ,
a call to
.Xr mq_open 3
with
.Fa name
fails if the flag
.Dv O_CREAT
is not set in
.Fa flags .
If one or more processes have the message queue open when
.Fn mq_unlink
is called, destruction of the message queue will be postponed until
all references to the message queue have been closed.
.Pp
Calls to
.Xr mq_open 3
to recreate the message queue may fail until the message queue is
actually removed.
However, the
.Fn mq_unlink
call need not block until all references have been closed;
it may return immediately.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the function returns a value of zero.
Otherwise, the named message queue will be unchanged by this function call,
and the function returns a value of \-1 and sets the global variable
.Va errno
to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS

.Fn mq_unlink
function fails if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
