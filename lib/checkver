# One of -d, -s or -f must be specified.
#
# all: If library name is not specified it is assumed to
#	be the name of the current directory.
#
# -d: Checks the version against the installed libraries.
#	If no further arguments are given "/usr/lib" is
#	used as the location of installed libraries.
#
# -s: Checks the version against the sets.  If no argument
#	follows the sets directory defaults to "/usr/src/distrib/sets/lists".
#	The directory may be specified as either the top of the
#	source tree or as the lists directory.
#
# -f: Checks the version against the provided list.  A filename
#	must be supplied.
#
# -v: Specify the filename of the shlib_version file.  Defaults
#     to "./shlib_version".
#
# This script produces no output if all library version are not 
# large than the source version.  If an installed library with a
# version greater than the source is found, checkver prints a
# header and a list of the names of the offending installed libraries.
#
# The header may be supressed by passing "-q" as the first argument.
