.Sh NAME
.Nm swap
.Nd system swap management tool
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.\" SWAP_OFF_WORKS: .Op Fl Aadkl
.Op Fl Aakl
.Op Fl p Ar priority
.Ar device
.Nm swapon
.Op Fl a
.Ar device
.\" .Nm swapoff
.\" .Ar device
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program adds,
.\" SWAP_OFF_WORKS: removes,
lists and prioritizes swap devices for the system.
The
.Nm swapon
program acts the same as the
.Nm
program, as if called with the
.Fl a
option, except if
.Nm swapon
itself is called with
.Fl a
in which case,
.Nm swapon
acts as 
.Nm
with the
.Fl A
option.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Sxxxsuffix
.It Fl A
This options causes
.Nm
to read the
.Pa /etc/fstab
file for devices with a ``sw'' type, and adds all these entries
as swap devices.
.It Fl a
The
.Fl a
option requires that a
.Ar device
also be in the argument list.  The
.Ar device
is added to the kernel's list of swap devices using the
.Xr swapon 2
system call.  The priority set by having ``priority=N'' in the
mount options field of the 
.Xr fstab 5 
file.
.\" .It Fl d
.\" The
.\" .Fl d
.\" option removes the listed
.\" .Ar device
.\" from the kernel's list of swap devices.
.It Fl l
The
.Fl l
option lists the current swap devices, and their usage statistics.
.It Fl p
The
.Fl p
option sets the priority of swap devices to the
.Ar priority
argument.  This works with the
.\" .Fl d ,
.Fl a
and
.Fl l
options.
.It Fl k
The
.Fl k
option uses 1024 byte blocks instead of the default 512 byte.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
program was first made available in
.Nx 1.3 .
The original
.Nm swapon
program appeared in
.Bx 4.0 ,
but is no longer distributed with
.Nx .
.Sh AUTHOR
The
.Nm
program was written by Matthew R. Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Fl A
option could also handle priorities in the fstab file somehow.
