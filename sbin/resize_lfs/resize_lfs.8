.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm resize_lfs
.Nd resize a mounted log-structured filesystem
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl s Ar new-size
.Ar mounted-file-system
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
grows or shrinks a mounted log-structured filesystem to the specified size.
.Ar mounted-file-system
is the name of the filesystem to be resized, and
.Ar new-size
is the desired new filesystem size, in sectors.
If
.Ar new-size
is not specified,
.Nm
will default to the current size of the partition containing the filesystem
in question.
.Pp
When growing, the partition must be large enough to contain a filesystem
of the specified size; when shrinking,
.Nm
must first
.Dq clean
the segments that will be invalid when the filesystem is shrunk.
If this cleaning process results in these segments becoming redirtied,
this indicates that the given new size is not large enough to contain the
existing filesystem data, and
.Nm
will return an error.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To resize the file system mounted at
.Pa /home
to 32576 sectors:
.Dl resize_lfs -s 32576 /home
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr fsck_lfs 8 ,
.Xr lfs_cleanerd 8 ,
.Xr newfs_lfs 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Nx 3.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Konrad Schroder
.Aq perseant@NetBSD.org
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
should be able to resize an unmounted filesystem as well.
