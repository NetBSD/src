.Dt MOUNT_CD9660 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_cd9660
.Nd mount an ISO-9660 filesystem
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ""
.Op Fl o Ar options
.Ar special node
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command attaches the ISO-9660 filesystem residing on the device
.Pa special
to the global filesystem namespace at the location indicated by
.Pa node .
This command is normally executed by
.Xr mount 8
at boot time.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl o
Options are specified with a
.Fl o
flag followed by a comma separated string of options.
Besides options mentioned in
.Xr mount 8
man page, following cd9660-specific options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm extatt
Enable the use of extended attributes.
.It Cm gens
Do not strip version numbers on files and leave the case of the filename
alone.
(By default, uppercase characters are translated to lowercase,
and if there are files with different version numbers on the disk,
only the last one will be listed.)
.Pp
In either case, files may be opened without giving a
version number, in which case you get the last one, or by explicitly
stating a version number (albeit it's quite difficult to know it, if
you are not using the
.Cm gens
option), in which case you get the specified version.
.It Cm nojoliet
Do not make use of Joliet extensions for long filenames which
may be present in the filesystem.
.Pp
Interpretation of Joliet extensions is enabled by default, but
currently does not support Unicode characters present in some
Joliet filesystems.
.It Cm nomaplcase
File names on cd9660 cdrom without Rock Ridge extension present
should be uppercase only. By default, cd9660 recodes file
names read from a non-Rock Ridge disk to all lowercase characters.
.Cm nomaplcase
turns off this mapping.
.It Cm norrip
Do not use any Rockridge extensions included in the filesystem.
.It Cm nrr
Same as
.Cm norrip .
For compatibility with Solaris only.
.It Cm rrcaseins
Makes all lookups case-insensitive even for CD-ROMs with Rock-Ridge
extensions (for Rock-Ridge, default is case-sensitive lookup).
.El
.El

For compatibility with previous releases, following obsolete flags are
still recognized:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl e
Same as
.Fl o
.Cm extatt .
.It Fl j
Same as
.Fl o
.Cm nojoliet .
.It Fl g
Same as
.Fl o
.Cm gens .
.It Fl r
Same as
.Fl o
.Cm norrip .
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mount 2 ,
.Xr unmount 2 ,
.Xr fstab 5 ,
.Xr mount 8
.Sh CAVEATS
For some cdroms the information in the Rock Ridge extension is wrong
and the cdrom needs to be mounted with "norrip".  A sign that something
is wrong is that the
.Xr stat 2
system call returns
.Er EBADF
causing, e.g., "ls -l" to fail with "Bad file descriptor".
.Sh BUGS
The cd9660 filesystem does not support the original "High Sierra"
("CDROM001") format.
.Pp
POSIX device node mapping is currently not supported.
.Pp
Version numbers are not stripped if Rockridge extensions are in use.
In this case, you have to use the original name of the file as recorded
on disk, i.e. use uppercase and append the version number to the file.
.Pp
There is no ECMA support.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared
.Bx 4.4 .
Support for Joliet filesystem appeared in
.Nx 1.4 .
Options
.Cm nomaplcase
and
.Cm rrcaseins
were added in
.Nx 1.5 .
