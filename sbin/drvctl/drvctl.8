.Sh NAME
.Nm drvctl
.Nd tool to rescan busses and detach devices on user request
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm

.Ar busdevice
.Op locator ...
.Nm
.Fl d

.Nm

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program works with the
.Xr drvctl 4
pseudo-driver, and allows to rescan busses and to detach
drivers from devices.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width 123456
.It Fl a
Give the interface attribute where children are to be
attached to (and which defines the interpretation of
the locator information).
This will only be needed in rare cases where the bus
has multiple attributes.
.It Fl d
Detach the device driver from the device given by the
.Ar device
argument.
.It Fl l
List the children of the device specified by the
.Ar device
argument.
If
.Ar device
is not specified, list roots of the device tree instead.
Output comes in two columns.
The first column is
.Ar device ,
or
.Dq root
if
.Ar device
is not specified.
The second column is the child.
.It Fl n
Suppress first column in
.Fl l
output.
.It Fl p
Get the properties for the device specified by the
.Ar device
argument.
The properties are displayed as an XML property list.
.It Fl Q
Resume the ancestors of
.Ar device ,
.Ar device
itself, and all of its descendants.
.It Fl R
Resume both the ancestors of
.Ar device
and
.Ar device
itself.
.It Fl r
Rescan the bus given by the
.Ar busdevice
argument.
The scan range can be restricted by an optional
.Ar locator
list.
.It Fl S
Suspend both the descendants of
.Ar device
and
.Ar device
itself.

.Sh BUGS
Currently, there is no good way to get information about locator
lengths and default values (which is present at kernel configuration
time) out of a running kernel.
Thus the locator handling is less intelligent as it could be.
