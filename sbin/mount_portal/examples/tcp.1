$NetBSD: tcp.1,v 1.3 2017/05/09 23:26:49 kamil Exp $

Use the following configuration file, tcp.1.conf:

tcp/	tcp	tcp/

Now mount it, and cat the contents of /p/tcp/localhost/daytime:
% mkdir portal
% mount_portal /usr/share/examples/mount_portal/tcp.1.conf `pwd`/portal
% cat portal/tcp/localhost/daytime

Philosophy:  With a pathname of <path to mountpount>/tcp/a/b[/priv],
the portal daemon opens a connection to host a, port b.  If /priv
is specified, the socket will be created via rresvport(), rather
than socket().

For the above example, we open a connection to the daytime port
(port 13, according to /etc/services), and read data.


Advanced usage:  finger
Using the already-mounted portal file system, open a connection
to the finger daemon, and do a finger.  Use the simple C program
in fing.c in this directory.

% make fing
cc -O2   -o fing fing.c
% fing

Philosophy:  fing.c opens portal/tcp/localhost/finger as a
read-write file.  First, we write the username for the finger (or
a blank line to see all users), then we read the results sent
over the socket.
