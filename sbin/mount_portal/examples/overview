Overall notes:

  1.  Whenever mounting anything with mount_portal, always
    specify absolute paths.  By specifying an absolute path for the
    configuration file, it can be re-parsed by sending a HUP to the
    mount process.  But since mount_portal calls daemon(), which
    does a chdir("/"), the re-parse will fail unless the
    specified file is absolute, not relative.

  2.  The mount point should always be specified as an absolute
    path.  Otherwise, umount may not be able to unmount it, as it
    first converts a relative path to an absolute path before
    checking against the mounted file systems (see
    realpath(3)).  If you mistakenly mount on portal, instead of
    `pwd`/portal, you can umount with "umount -R portal", which
    may seg fault, but it will umount.
