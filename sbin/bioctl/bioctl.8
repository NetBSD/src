.Sh NAME
.Nm bioctl
.Nd RAID management interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm bioctl
.Ar device
.Ar command
.Op Ar arg Op ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
RAID device drivers which support management functionality can
register their services with the
.Xr bio 4
driver.
.Nm bioctl
then can be used to manage RAID controller's properties.
.Sh COMMANDS
The following commands are supported:
.Bl -tag -width XXstrategyXXnameXX
.It Ic show Op Ar disks | volumes
Without any argument by default it will show information about
all volumes and the logical disks used on them. If
.Ar disks
is specified, only information will be shown about physical disks.
If
.Ar volumes
is specified, only information will be shown about the volumes.
.It Ic alarm Op Ar enable | disable | silence | test
Control the RAID card's alarm functionality, if supported. By default
its state will be shown if no argument is specified. Optionally the
.Ar enable ,
.Ar disable ,
.Ar silence
or
.Ar test
argument may be specified to enable, disable, silence or test the
RAID card's alarm.
.It Ic blink Ar start | stop Op Ar channel:target.lun
Instruct the device at
.Ar channel:target.lun
to start or cease blinking, if there's
.Xr ses 4
support in the enclosure.
.It Ic hotspare Ar add | remove Ar channel:target.lun
Create or remove a hot-spare drive at location
.Ar channel:target.lun .
.It Ic passthru Ar add DISKID | remove Ar channel:target.lun
Create or remove a
.Ar pass-through
device. The
.Ar DISKID
argument specifies the disk that will be used for the new device, and
it will be created at
.Ar channel:target.lun
location.
.Em NOTE :
removing a pass-through device that has a mounted filesystem will lead to
undefined behaviour.
.It Ic check Ar start | stop VOLID
Start or stop consistency volume check in the volume with index
.Ar VOLID .
.Em NOTE :
not many RAID controllers will support this feature.
.It Ic create volume Ar VOLID DISKIDs Oo Ar SIZE Oc Ar STRIPE RAID_LEVEL channel:target.lun
Create a volume at index
.Ar VOLID .
The
.Ar DISKIDs
argument will specify the first and last disk, i.e:
.Em 0-3
will use the disks 0, 1, 2 and 3. The
.Ar SIZE
argument is optional and may be specified if not all available disk space is
wanted (dependent of the
.Ar RAID_LEVEL
too). The volume will have a stripe size defined in the
.Ar STRIPE
argument and it will be located at
.Ar channel:target.lun .
.It Ic remove volume Ar VOLID channel:target.lun
Remove a volume at index
.Ar VOLID
and located at
.Ar channel:target.lun .
.Em NOTE: 
removing a RAID volume that has a mounted filesystem will lead to
undefined behaviour.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following command, executed from the command line, shows the status of
the volumes and its logical disks on the RAID controller:
.Bd -literal
# bioctl show arcmsr0
