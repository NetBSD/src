.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm bioctl
.Nd RAID management interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm bioctl
.Ar device
.Ar command
.Op Ar arg Op ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
RAID device drivers which support management functionality can
register their services with the
.Xr bio 4
driver.
.Nm bioctl
then can be used to manage the RAID controller's properties.
.Sh COMMANDS
The following commands are supported:
.Bl -tag -width XXstrategyXXnameXX
.It Ic show Op Ar disks | volumes
Without any argument by default
.Nm
will show information about all volumes and the logical disks used
on them.
If
.Ar disks
is specified, only information about physical disks will be shown.
If
.Ar volumes
is specified, only information about the volumes will be shown.
.It Ic alarm Op Ar disable | enable | silence | test
Control the RAID card's alarm functionality, if supported.
By default if no argument is specified, its current state will be
shown.
Optionally the
.Ar disable ,
.Ar enable ,
.Ar silence ,
or
.Ar test
arguments may be specified to enable, disable, silence, or test
the RAID card's alarm.
.It Ic blink Ar start channel:target.lun | stop channel:target.lun
Instruct the device at
.Ar channel:target.lun
to start or cease blinking, if there's
.Xr ses 4
support in the enclosure.
.It Ic hotspare Ar add channel:target.lun | remove channel:target.lun
Create or remove a hot-spare drive at location
.Ar channel:target.lun .
.It Ic passthru Ar add DISKID channel:target.lun | remove Ar channel:target.lun
Create or remove a
.Ar pass-through
device.
The
.Ar DISKID
argument specifies the disk that will be used for the new device, and
it will be created at the location
.Ar channel:target.lun .
.Em NOTE :
Removing a pass-through device that has a mounted filesystem will
lead to undefined behaviour.
.It Ic check Ar start VOLID | stop VOLID
Start or stop consistency volume check in the volume with index
.Ar VOLID .
.Em NOTE :
Not many RAID controllers support this feature.
.It Ic create volume Ar VOLID DISKIDs Oo Ar SIZE Oc Ar STRIPE RAID_LEVEL channel:target.lun
Create a volume at index
.Ar VOLID .
The
.Ar DISKIDs
argument will specify the first and last disk, i.e.:
.Em 0-3
will use the disks 0, 1, 2, and 3.
The
.Ar SIZE
argument is optional and may be specified if not all available disk
space is wanted (also dependent of the
.Ar RAID_LEVEL ) .
The volume will have a stripe size defined in the
.Ar STRIPE
argument and it will be located at
.Ar channel:target.lun .
.It Ic remove volume Ar VOLID channel:target.lun
Remove a volume at index
.Ar VOLID
and located at
.Ar channel:target.lun .
.Em NOTE :
Removing a RAID volume that has a mounted filesystem will lead to
undefined behaviour.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following command, executed from the command line, shows the
status of the volumes and its logical disks on the RAID controller:
.Bd -literal
$ bioctl arcmsr0 show

.Pp
To create a RAID 5 volume on the SCSI 0:15.0 location on the disks
0, 1, 2, and 3, with stripe size of 64Kb on the first volume ID,
using all available free space on the disks:
.Pp
.Dl $ bioctl arcmsr0 create volume 0 0-3 64 5 0:15.0
.Pp
To remove the volume 0 previously created at the SCSI 0:15.0 location:
.Pp
.Dl $ bioctl arcmsr0 remove volume 0 0:15.0
