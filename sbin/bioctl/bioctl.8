.Sh DESCRIPTION
RAID device drivers which support management functionality can
register their services with the

.It Fl b Ar channel:target[.lun]
Instruct the device at
.Ar channel:target[.lun]
to start blinking, if there is
.Xr ses 4
support in the enclosure.
.It Fl H Ar channel:target[.lun]
If the device at
.Ar channel:target[.lun]
is currently marked
.Dq Unused ,
promote it to being a
.Dq Hot Spare .
.It Fl h
Where necessary, produce
.Dq human-readable
output.
Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte,
Gigabyte, Terabyte, Petabyte, Exabyte in order to reduce the number of
digits to four or less.
.It Fl u Ar channel:target[.lun]
Instruct the device at
.Ar channel:target[.lun]
to cease blinking, if there is
.Xr ses 4
support in the enclosure.
.It Fl v
Be more verbose in output.
.It Ar device
Select a drive by name (e.g., sd0) or a RAID controller by name (e.g., ami0).
For operations which will be performed against
.Xr ses 4
enclosures, it is also possible to directly specify the enclosure name
(e.g., safte0).

.Sh EXAMPLES
The following command, executed from the command line, shows the status of
the logical drives on the RAID controller:
