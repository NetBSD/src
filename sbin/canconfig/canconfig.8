.Nm canconfig
.Nd configure CAN network interface parameters
.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Ar can
.Ar command
.Op Ar args ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to configure CAN network interface parameters and retrieve
CAN network interface parameters and status from the kernel.
.Ss Timing
.Pp
The base time unit used to define the network bit rate is the time quanta (tq),
its value is defined by the input clock freqency and the prescaler value
as (1/ freq * prescaler).
.Pp
The network bit time is split in 4 segments:
.Bl -tag -width "phase_seg1" -offset indent -compact
.It sync_seg
fixed to 1 tq
.It prop_seg
.It phase_seg1
.It phase_seg2
.El
The network bit time is (1 + prop_seg + phase_seg1 + phase_seg2), in tq.
The sample point is between phase_seg1 and phase_seg2.
.Pp
The receiver hardware is allowed to shorten prop_seg or phase_seg2 to
resynchronise with the sender. The swj (Synchronisation Jump Width) parameter
defines by how much the hardware can shorten these segments.
.Pp
Some hardware can use 3 sample points instead of one, and keep the majority as
the final value.
.Ss Options
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Display the status of all CAN devices present on the system.
This flag is mutually exclusive with all other sub-commands.
.El
.Pp
All other operations require that a CAN interface be specified.
If a CAN interface is specified with no sub-commands,
the status of that interface is displayed.
.Pp
The following sub-commands are available:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm up
Start network operations on the interface. Requires that all timing parameters
have been set.
.It Cm down
Stop network operations on the interface.
.It Cm brp Ar value
Set the value of the baud rate prescaler.
.It Cm prop_seg Ar value
set the number of tq for the propagation segment.
.It Cm phase_seg1 Ar value
set the number of tq for the phase segment 1.
.It Cm phase_seg2 Ar value
set the number of tq for the phase segment 2.
.It Cm sjw Ar value
set the number of tq for the Synchronisation Jump Width.
.It Cm 3samples
enables triple-sampling.
.It Cm -3samples
disables triple-sampling.
