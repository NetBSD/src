.Dt MOUNT_MSDOS 8
.Os NetBSD 0.9
.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_msdos
.Nd mount an MS-DOS file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mount_msdos
.Op Fl F Ar fsoptions
.Pa special
.Pa node
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm mount_msdos
command attaches the MS-DOS filesystem residing on
the device
.Pa special
to the global filesystem namespace at the location
indicated by
.Pa node .
This command is normally executed by
.Xr mount 8 .
at boot time.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mount 2 ,
.Xr unmount 2 ,
.Xr fstab 5
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm msdos
filesystem is not known to work reliably with filesystems created by versions
of MS-DOS later than version 3.3.
.Pp
The limitations on file names imposed by MS-DOS are strange, at best.
For instance, they are
limited to single-case, 8 character names with 3 character extensions.
.Pp
You should be able to mount an MS-DOS filesystem on a big-endian
machine.  This is probably not currently possible.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm mount_msdos
utility first appeared in NetBSD 0.9.
Its predecessor, the
.Nm mount_pcfs
utility appeared in NetBSD 0.8, and was abandoned in favor
of the more aptly-named
.Nm mount_msdos .
