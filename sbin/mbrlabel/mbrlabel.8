.Dt MBRLABEL 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mbrlabel
.Nd generate incore disk label from MBR label(s)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl fq
.Ar device
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to update an incore
.Nx
disk label from the Master Boot Record (MBR) label(s) found
on disks that were previously used on DOS/Windows systems (or
other MBR using systems).
.Pp
.Nm
scans the MBR contained in the very first block of the disk,
then walks through every extended partition found and generating
additional partition entries for the disk from the MBRs found in
those extended partitions.
.Pp
Each MBR partition which does not have an equivalent partition in incore
disk label (equivalent in having the same size and offset) is added to
the first free partition slot in the incore disk label. A free
partition slot is defined as one with an
.Dv fstype
of
.Sq Li unused
and a
.Dv size
of zero
.Pq Sq 0 .
If there are not enough free slots in the incore disk label, a warning
will be issued.
.Pp
The raw partition (typically partition
.Em c ,
but
.Em d
on i386 and some othe platforms) is left alone during this process.
.Pp
If
.Fl f
is given, then the incore disk label is updated.
Otherwise, the proposed changed disk label will be displayed and no
update will occur.
.Pp
If
.Fl q
is given,
.Nm
performs its operation in a quiet fashion.
