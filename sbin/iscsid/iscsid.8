.Sh NAME
.Nm iscsid
.Nd interface to kernel iSCSI driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The iSCSI initiator runs as a kernel driver, and provides access
to iSCSI targets running across a network using the iSCSI protocol,
RFC 3270.
The
.Nm
utility itself interfaces to the kernel iSCSI driver, and also
communicates, using
.Xr isns 3 ,
with the iSCSI name service running on other hosts
to locate services and iSCSI instances.
In normal operation,
.Nm
is a standard daemon, and will detach from the controlling
terminal using
.Xr daemon 3
and then loops, reading requests, processing them,
and sending responses.
Communication takes place over a
Unix domain socket.
.Nm
exits on receiving a terminate message,
(no response to one that is sent to the kernel),
or when an error occurs reading from or writing to the socket.
.Pp
There are no command line arguments to
.Nm .
.Pp
It is envisaged that user-level communication take place with
.Nm
using the
.Xr iscsictl 8
utility, rather than directly over its communication socket.
An example of setting up the in-kernel iSCSI initiator
is shown in
.Xr iscsictl 8 .
