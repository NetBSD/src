.Sh NAME
.Nm iscsid
.Nd interface to kernel iSCSI driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl D
.Op Fl d Ar lvl
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The iSCSI initiator runs as a kernel driver, and provides access
to iSCSI targets running across a network using the iSCSI protocol,
RFC 3720.
The
.Nm
utility itself interfaces to the kernel iSCSI driver, and also
communicates, using
.Xr isns 3 ,
with the iSCSI name service running on other hosts
to locate services and iSCSI instances.
In normal operation,
.Nm
is a standard daemon, and will detach from the controlling
terminal using
.Xr daemon 3
and then loops, reading requests, processing them,
and sending responses.
Communication takes place over a
Unix domain socket.
.Nm
exits on receiving a terminate message,
(no response to one that is sent to the kernel),
or when an error occurs reading from or writing to the socket.
.Pp
The
.Fl d
flag increases the log level to
.Ar lvl .
At level 0 only start and stop messages are logged.
The
.Fl D
flag causes
.Nm
to remain in the foreground and to write log output to stdout.
.Pp
It is envisaged that user-level communication take place with
.Nm
using the
.Xr iscsictl 8
utility, rather than directly over its communication socket.
An example of setting up the in-kernel iSCSI initiator
is shown in
.Xr iscsictl 8 .

utility appeared in
