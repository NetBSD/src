.Dt MOUNT_EXFATFS 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_exfatfs
.Nd mount an exFAT file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl g Ar gid
.Op Fl M Ar mask
.Op Fl m Ar mask
.Op Fl o Ar options
.Op Fl t Ar gmtoff
.Op Fl u Ar uid
.Pa special
.Pa node
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command attaches the exFAT file system residing on
the device
.Pa special
to the global file system namespace at the location
indicated by
.Pa node .
Both
.Ar special
and
.Ar node
are converted to absolute paths before use.
This command is normally executed by
.Xr mount 8
at boot time, but can be used by any user to mount an
exFAT file system on any directory that they own (provided,
of course, that they have appropriate access to the device that
contains the file system).
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XoXoptionsXX
.It Fl g Ar gid
Set the group of the files in the file system to
.Ar gid .
The default group is the group of the directory
on which the file system is being mounted.
.It Fl M Ar mask
Specify the maximum file permissions for directories
in the file system.
The value of
.Fl m
is used if it is supplied and
.Fl M
is omitted.
.It Fl m Ar mask
Specify the maximum file permissions for files
in the file system.
(For example, a mask of
.Li 755
specifies that, by default, the owner should have
read, write, and execute permissions for files, but
others should only have read and execute permissions.
See
.Xr chmod 1
for more information about octal file modes.)
Only the nine low-order bits of
.Ar mask
are used.
The value of
.Fl M
is used if it is supplied and
.Fl m
is omitted.
The default mask is taken from the
directory on which the file system is being mounted.
.It Fl o Ar options
Use the specified mount
.Ar options ,
as described in
.Xr mount 8 .
.It Fl s
Force behaviour to
ignore and not generate Win'95 long filenames.
See also
.Fl l .
.It Fl u Ar uid
Set the owner of the files in the file system to
.Ar uid .
The default owner is the owner of the directory
on which the file system is being mounted.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To remove the 'execute' permission bit for all files, but still keep
directories searchable, use:
.Bl -item -offset indent
.It
mount_exfatfs -m 0644 -M 0755 /dev/wd0e /exfat
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mount 2 ,
.Xr unmount 2 ,
.Xr fstab 5 ,
.Xr mount 8

The
.Nm
command appeared first in
.Nx 11.0 .
