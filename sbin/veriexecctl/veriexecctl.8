.Sh NAME
.Nm veriexecctl
.Nd load verified exec fingerprints
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar fingerprints
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command loads the in-kernel fingerprint table from the fingerprints
given in the
.Ar fingerprints
file.
Once loaded the kernel can then validate executed programs
or files against the loaded fingerprints and report when fingerprints
do not match.
.Pp
The
.Ar fingerprints
file contains lines of fields (separated by one or more whitespace
characters) of the form:
.Pp
.Dl path	type	fingerprint	options
.Pp
Where
.Em path
is the full path to the file and
.Em type
is the type of fingerprint used, currently this may be either md5 or sha1.
Other fingerprints may be available depending on kernel support.
The
.Em fingerprint
field is a hexadecimal representation of the fingerprint for
the file.
The field
.Em options
contains the associated options for the file.
Currently there are two valid options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width INDIRECT -compact
.Pp
.It Pa INDIRECT
If this option is set then the executable cannot be invoked directly, it
can only be used as an interpreter in shell scripts.
.It Pa FILE
Indicates that the fingerprint is associated with a file, not an
executable.
Files have their fingerprints verified during
.Xr open 2
and are automatically made read only.
This option may be used to verify shared libraries have not been
tampered with.
.El
.Pp
There must be only one executable/fingerprint pair per line.
Comments are indicated by the first character of a line being a
.Sq \&#
character.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/veriexec -compact
.It Pa /dev/veriexec
verified executable device node
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Pa /usr/share/examples/veriexecctl/gen_md5 ,
.Pa /usr/share/examples/veriexecctl/gen_sha1 .
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
first appeared in
.Nx 2.0 .
.Sh NOTES
.Nm
requires the kernel to have been configured with the
.Dv VERIFIED_EXEC
option and the verifiedexec pseudo-device.
