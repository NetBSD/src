.Sh NAME
.Nm veriexecctl
.Nd load or report veriexec fingerprints
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Cm load Ar signatures
.Nm
.Cm delete Op file | mount_point
.Nm
.Cm query Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to manipulate the Veriexec feature.
Veriexec must have been configured into the booted kernel for this
commaned to work.
.Ss Commands
.Bl -tag -width 25n
.It Cm load Ar signatures
Load the fingerprint entries contained in
.Ar signatures
into the in kernel tables.
This operation is only available if kern.veriexec.strict is zero.
Once loaded the kernel can then validate executed programs
or files against the loaded fingerprints and report when fingerprints
do not match.
.It Cm delete Op file | mount_point
Delete the specified file from the Veriexec table in which it is stored.
If the argument is a mount_point (or a directory), the device id for
it is fetched and the entire Veriexec table that refers to it is
removed.
.It Cm query Ar file
Query Veriexec about information associated with
.Ar file :
Filename, mount, fingerprint, fingerprint algorithm, evaluation status,
and entry type.
.El
.Ss Signatures
The
.Pa signatures
file contains lines of fields (separated by one or more whitespace
characters) of the form:
.Pp
.Dl path	type	fingerprint	options
.Pp
Where
.Em path
is the full path to the file and
.Em type
is the type of fingerprint used, see above for the default list.
Other fingerprints may be available depending on kernel configuration.
The
.Em fingerprint
field is a hexadecimal representation of the fingerprint for
the file.
The field
.Em options
contains the associated options for the file.
Currently there are eight valid options, five of which are aliases
to improve readability of the database files:
.Pp
.Bl -tag
.It Dv DIRECT
Allow direct execution only.
.It Dv INDIRECT
If this option is set then the executable cannot be invoked directly, it
can only be used as an interpreter in scripts.
.It Dv FILE
Indicates that the fingerprint is associated with a file, not an
executable.
Files have their fingerprints verified during
.Xr open 2
and are automatically made read only.
This option may be used to verify shared libraries have not been
tampered with.
.It Dv PROGRAM
An alias for
.Dv DIRECT ,
allow direct execution only.
.It Dv INTERPRETER
An alias for
.Dv INDIRECT ,
the executable may only be used as an interpreter
for scripts.
.It Dv SCRIPT
The file is a script.
For correct operation of veriexec, a script must have both
.Dv FILE
and
.Dv DIRECT
attributes set.
This option is a shorthand way of setting the options for correct
operation of scripts.
.It Dv LIBRARY
The file is a library, this option is an alias for
.Dv FILE
and
.Dv INDIRECT .
.It Dv UNTRUSTED
This option is used to indicate that the file is located on
untrusted storage, and its fingerprint should not be cached,
but calculated each time it is accessed and when pages with
this file as backing store are paged in.
.El
.Pp
There must be only one executable/fingerprint pair per line.
Comments are indicated by the first character of a line being a
.Sq \&#
character.
Multiple options can be combined using a
.Sq \&,
character.
If no options are specified, both direct and indirect execution
are implied.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/signatures -compact
.It Pa /dev/veriexec
veriexec device node
.It Pa /etc/signatures
default signatures file
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr veriexec 4 ,
.Xr veriexecgen 8
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
first appeared in
.Nx 2.0 .
.Sh NOTES
.Nm
requires the kernel to have been configured with the veriexec pseudo-device.
.Sh BUGS
There must be no whitespace in the path field of a fingerprint entry.
