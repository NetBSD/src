.Pa node
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command attaches the UDF file system residing on the specified
.Pa special
device node on the location indicated with
.Pa node .
.Pp
Anonymous files stored on the UDF disc will be represented and saved in the
specified uid:gid pair. If unspecified it will default to nobody:nobody. Both
uid and gid can be either specified with their names as with their numerical
equivalents.
.Bl -tag -width XXXoptions
.\" -c flag specifies closure of CD/DVD session after dismount (writing)
.It Fl g Ar gid
Set the group of anonymous files on the file system. The default group is the
nobody group.
.It Fl o Ar options
Use the specified mount
.Ar options
as specified in
.Xr mount 8 .
.It Fl s Ar session
Select the session
.Ar session
to be mounted instead of the default last one. Positive
.Ar session
values indicate an absolute session number. Negative
.Ar session
values are relative to the last lession found on the disc.
Note that this option only makes sense when mounting sequential recordable
media like CD-R and DVD*R.
.It Fl t Ar gmtoff

.Ar gmtoff .
with positive values indicating east of the Prime Meridian.
If not set, the user's current time zone will be used.

.Sh NOTES
UDF is a file system defined by the OSTA standardisation group and is tailored
for data interchange on optical discs (like CDs and DVDs) between different
operating systems. Its also more and more common on other media like Compact
Flash (CF) cards.
.Pp
Currently only read access is supported to all media types that CD/DVD type
drives can recognize including DVD-RAM and BlueRay drives. Write access is
planned and in preparation.
.Pp
Implemented and tested media types are CD-ROM, CD-R, CD-RW, CD-MRW, DVD-ROM,
DVD*R, DVD*RW, DVD+MRW but the same code can also read DVD-RAM, HD-DVD and
BluRay discs. Discs created and written by UDFclient, Nero's InCD and Roxio's
DirectCD/Drag2Disc read fine. Both open and closed media are supported so
there is no need to close discs or close sessions.
.Pp
Support for harddisc partitions and optionally for files (like using vnd) is
not implemented yet.
.Pp
All current UDF versions upto version 2.60 are supported.
.Sh BUGS
Due to lack of test media version 2.50 and 2.60 are prepared though not
implemented and tested yet.
