.Sh NAME
.Nm fsirand
.Nd install random inode generation numbers in a filesystem
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl x Ar constant
.Op Fl p
.Ar special
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
writes random inode generation numbers for all the inodes on device
.Ar special .
These random numbers make the NFS filehandles less predictable, increasing
security of exported filesystems.
.Pp
.Nm
should be run on a clean and unmounted filesystem.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl x Ar constant
Exclusive-or the given constant with the random number used in the generation
process.
.It Fl p
Print the current inode generation numbers; the filesystem is not modified.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
exits zero on success, non-zero on failure.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr fsck_ffs 8 ,
.Xr newfs 8
.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
The current implementation does not use a good random number generator,
so the randomization can be predicted.
