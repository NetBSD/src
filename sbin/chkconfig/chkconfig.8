.Os NetBSD
.Sh NAME
.Nm chkconfig
.Nd rc.conf.d management utility
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar service
.Nm ""
.Op Fl f
.Ar service
.Op Ar on | off
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility allows a system administrator to easily manage services
started by
.Xr rc 8 .
.Pp
With no arguments,
.Nm
will print the state (on or off) of every service found in the
directory
.Pa /etc/rc.conf.d/ .
The settings will be shown sorted according to the output of
.Xr rcorder 8 .
.Pp
If the
.Ar service
is specified as the sole argument,
.Nm
exits with status 0 if the service is
.Sq on
and status 1 if
.Sq off .
The exit status may be used by shell scripts to test the state of
a service, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if chkconfig wscons; then
	echo "wscons is on"
else
	echo "wscons is off"
fi
.Ed
.Pp
The optional third argument allows the specified service to be set
to
.Sq on
or
.Sq off
for the next time its
.Xr rc.d 8
script is run (generally the next system reboot).
.Pp
In order for
.Nm
to display service status or to control service state, the service
must be managed by
.Nm "" .
A
.Nm
managed service is one that has the
.Xr rcorder 8
keyword
.Dq chkconfig
present in the
.Xr rc.d
script for that service.  If a service's script does not contain
this keyword, it may still be managed by
.Nm
using the
.Fl f
flag.  When this flag is used,
.Nm
will automatically add the
.Dq chkconfig
keyword to the service's script.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr rc 8 ,
.Xr rcorder 8
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
program currently does not support configuring the options
to be passed to services upon startup.
.Sh AUTHOR
The
.Nm
program was written by
.An Dan Mercer
.Aq dmercer@zembu.com
of Zembu Labs, Inc.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Nx 1.6 .
