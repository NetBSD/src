.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Mounts a flash file system from a
.Xr flash 4
device.
CHFS file systems can be only mounted from flash devices.
For regular block devices like SSD drives or USB drives,
please use a regular file system.
The file system will be created during the first mount.
CHFS stands for Chip File System.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl mount_chfs /dev/flash0 /mnt
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr flash 4 ,
.Xr fstab 5 ,
.Xr mount 8 ,
.Xr flash 9
.Sh HISTORY
CHFS was originally called ChewieFS during development.
The name was changed to avoid legal issues and to have a more
neutral name.
.Sh AUTHORS
CHFS was developed at the Department of Software Engineering,
University of Szeged, Hungary.
.Sh BUGS
CHFS has a few known bugs as of 2011.
Writing the FS full can cause problems.
Truncating a file and growing it again can cause the new bytes
not having all zeroes, but filled with the old content instead.
