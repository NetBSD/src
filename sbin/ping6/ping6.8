.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
uses the ICMPv6 protocol's mandatory
.Dv ICMP6_ECHO_REQUEST
datagram to elicit an
.Dv ICMP6_ECHO_REPLY
from a host or gateway.
.Dv ICMP6_ECHO_REQUEST
datagrams (``pings'') have an IPv6 header,
and ICMPv6 header formatted as documented in RFC 2463.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.\" old IPsec
.\" .It Fl A
.\" Enables transport-mode IPsec authentication header
.\" .Pq experimental .
.It Fl a Ar addrtype
Generate ICMPv6 Node Information Node Addresses query, rather than echo-request.
.Ar addrtype
must be a string constructed of the following characters.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic a
requests unicast addresses from all of the responder's interfaces.
If the character is omitted,
only those addresses which belong to the interface which has the
responder's address are requests.
.It Ic c
requests responder's IPv4-compatible and IPv4-mapped addresses.
.It Ic g
requests responder's global-scope addresses.
.It Ic s
requests responder's site-local addresses.
.It Ic l
requests responder's link-local addresses.
.It Ic A
requests responder's anycast addresses.
Without this character, the responder will return unicast addresses only.
With this character, the responder will return anycast addresses only.
Note that the specification does not specify how to get responder's
anycast addresses.
This is an experimental option.
.El
.It Fl b Ar bufsiz
Set socket buffer size.
.It Fl c Ar count
Stop after sending
.Pq and receiving
.Ar count
.Dv ECHO_RESPONSE
packets.
.It Fl d
Set the
.Dv SO_DEBUG
option on the socket being used.
.\" .It Fl E
.\" Enables transport-mode IPsec encapsulated security payload
.\" .Pq experimental .
.It Fl f
Flood ping.
Outputs packets as fast as they come back or one hundred times per second,
whichever is more.
For every
.Dv ECHO_REQUEST
sent a period
.Dq \&.
is printed, while for every
.Dv ECHO_REPLY
received a backspace is printed.
This provides a rapid display of how many packets are being dropped.
Only the super-user may use this option.
.Bf -emphasis
This can be very hard on a network and should be used with caution.
.Ef
.It Fl g Ar gateway
Specifies to use
.Ar gateway
as the next hop to the destination.
The gateway must be a neighbor of the sending node.
.It Fl H
Specifies to try reverse-lookup of IPv6 addresses.
The
.Nm
command does not try reverse-lookup unless the option is specified.
.It Fl h Ar hoplimit
Set the IPv6 hoplimit.
.It Fl I Ar interface
Source packets with the given interface address.
This flag applies if the ping destination is a multicast address,
or link-local/site-local unicast address.
.It Fl i Ar wait
Wait
.Ar wait
seconds
.Em between sending each packet .
The default is to wait for one second between each packet.
This option is incompatible with the
.Fl f
option.
.It Fl l Ar preload
If
.Ar preload
is specified,
.Nm
sends that many packets as fast as possible before falling into its normal
mode of behavior.
Only the super-user may use this option.
.It Fl m
By default,
.Nm
asks the kernel to fragment packets to fit into the minimum IPv6 MTU.
.Fl m
will suppress the behavior in the following two levels:
when the option is specified once, the behavior will be disabled for
unicast packets.
When the option is specified more than once, it will be disabled for both
unicast and multicast packets.
.It Fl N
Probe node information multicast group
.Pq Li ff02::2:xxxx:xxxx .
.Ar host
must be string hostname of the target
.Pq must not be a numeric IPv6 address .
Node information multicast group will be computed based on given
.Ar host ,
and will be used as the final destination.
Since node information multicast group is a link-local multicast group,
outgoing interface needs to be specified by
.Fl I
option.
.It Fl n
Numeric output only.
No attempt will be made to lookup symbolic names from addresses in the reply.
.It Fl o
Exit successfully after receiving one reply packet.
.It Fl P Ar policy
.Ar policy
specifies IPsec policy to be used for the probe.
.It Fl p Ar pattern
You may specify up to 16
.Dq pad
bytes to fill out the packet you send.
This is useful for diagnosing data-dependent problems in a network.
For example,
.Dq Li \-p ff
will cause the sent packet to be filled with all
ones.
.\" new IPsec
.It Fl q
Quiet output.
Nothing is displayed except the summary lines at startup time and
when finished.
.It Fl S Ar sourceaddr
Specifies the source address of request packets.
The source address must be one of the unicast addresses of the sending node,
and must be numeric.
.It Fl s Ar packetsize
Specifies the number of data bytes to be sent.
The default is 56, which translates into 64 ICMP data bytes when combined
with the 8 bytes of ICMP header data.
You may need to specify
.Fl b
as well to extend socket buffer size.
.It Fl t
Generate ICMPv6 Node Information supported query types query,
rather than echo-request.
.Fl s
has no effect if
.Fl t
is specified.
.It Fl v
Verbose output.
ICMP packets other than
.Dv ECHO_RESPONSE
that are received are listed.
.It Fl W
Same as
.Fl w ,
but with old packet format based on 03 draft.
This option is present for backward compatibility.
.Fl s
has no effect if
.Fl w
is specified.
.It Fl w
Generate ICMPv6 Node Information DNS Name query, rather than echo-request.
.Fl s
has no effect if
.Fl w
is specified.
.It Fl X Ar deadline
Specify a timeout, in seconds, before ping exits regardless of
how many packets have been received.
.It Ar host
IPv6 address of the final destination node.
.It Fl x Ar maxwait
Time in milliseconds to wait for a reply for each packet sent.
.El
.Pp
When using
.Nm
for fault isolation, it should first be run on the local host, to verify
that the local network interface is up and running.
Then, hosts and gateways further and further away should be
.Dq pinged .
Round-trip times and packet loss statistics are computed.
If duplicate packets are received, they are not included in the packet
loss calculation, although the round trip time of these packets is used
in calculating the round-trip time statistics.
When the specified number of packets have been sent
.Pq and received
or if the program is terminated with a
.Dv SIGINT ,
a brief summary is displayed, showing the number of packets sent and
received, and the minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation of
the round-trip times.
.Pp
This program is intended for use in network testing, measurement and
management.
Because of the load it can impose on the network, it is unwise to use
.Nm
during normal operations or from automated scripts.
.\" .Sh ICMP PACKET DETAILS
.\" An IP header without options is 20 bytes.
.\" An
.\" ICMP
.\" .Dv ECHO_REQUEST
.\" packet contains an additional 8 bytes worth of
.\" ICMP
.\" header followed by an arbitrary amount of data.
.\" When a
.\" .Ar packetsize
.\" is given, this indicated the size of this extra piece of data
.\" .Pq the default is 56 .
.\" Thus the amount of data received inside of an IP packet of type
.\" ICMP
.\" .Dv ECHO_REPLY
.\" will always be 8 bytes more than the requested data space
.\" .Pq the ICMP header .
.\" .Pp
.\" If the data space is at least eight bytes large,
.\" .Nm
.\" uses the first eight bytes of this space to include a timestamp which
.\" it uses in the computation of round trip times.
.\" If less than eight bytes of pad are specified, no round trip times are
.\" given.
.Sh DUPLICATE AND DAMAGED PACKETS
.Nm
will report duplicate and damaged packets.
Duplicate packets should never occur when pinging a unicast address,
and seem to be caused by
inappropriate link-level retransmissions.
Duplicates may occur in many situations and are rarely
.Pq if ever
a good sign, although the presence of low levels of duplicates may not
always be cause for alarm.
Duplicates are expected when pinging a multicast address,
since they are not really duplicates but replies from different hosts
to the same request.
.Pp
Damaged packets are obviously serious cause for alarm and often
indicate broken hardware somewhere in the
.Nm
packet's path
.Pq in the network or in the hosts .
.Sh TRYING DIFFERENT DATA PATTERNS
The
(inter)network
layer should never treat packets differently depending on the data
contained in the data portion.
Unfortunately, data-dependent problems have been known to sneak into
networks and remain undetected for long periods of time.
In many cases the particular pattern that will have problems is something
that does not have sufficient
.Dq transitions ,
such as all ones or all zeros, or a pattern right at the edge, such as
almost all zeros.
It is not
necessarily enough to specify a data pattern of all zeros (for example)
on the command line because the pattern that is of interest is
at the data link level, and the relationship between what you type and
what the controllers transmit can be complicated.
.Pp
This means that if you have a data-dependent problem you will probably
have to do a lot of testing to find it.
If you are lucky, you may manage to find a file that either
cannot
be sent across your network or that takes much longer to transfer than
other similar length files.
You can then examine this file for repeated patterns that you can test
using the
.Fl p
option of
.Nm .
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
exits with 0 on success (the host is alive),
and non-zero if the arguments are incorrect or the host is not responding.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Normally,
.Nm
works just like
.Xr ping 8
would work; the following will send ICMPv6 echo request to
.Li dst.foo.com .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ping6 -n dst.foo.com
.Ed
.Pp
The following will probe hostnames for all nodes on the network link attached to
.Li wi0
interface.
The address
.Li ff02::1
is named the link-local all-node multicast address, and the packet would
reach every node on the network link.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ping6 -w ff02::1%wi0
.Ed
.Pp
The following will probe addresses assigned to the destination node,
.Li dst.foo.com .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ping6 -a agl dst.foo.com
.Ed
