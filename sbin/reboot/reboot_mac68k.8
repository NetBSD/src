bootstrapping procedures
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm reboot
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl q
.Op Fl s
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Tn NetBSD
kernel is started by placing it at the beginning of physical memory
and transferring to the entry point.
Since the system is not reenterable,
it is necessary to read it in from disk or tape
each time it is to be bootstrapped.
.Pp
.Sy Rebooting a running system .
When a
.Tn NetBSD
kernel is running and a reboot is desired,
.Xr shutdown 8
is normally used.
If there are no users then
.Nm reboot
can be used.
Reboot causes the disks to be synced and allows the system
to perform other shutdown activities such as resynchronizing
hardware time-of-day clocks.
A multi-user reboot (as described below) is then initiated.
This causes a system to be
booted and an automatic disk check to be performed.  If all this succeeds
without incident, the system is then brought up for many users.
.Pp
Options to reboot are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.\" .It Fl d
.\" option forces a memory dump to the swap area (see
.\" .Xr crash 8 )
.\" before rebooting.
.\" This can be used if the system is in a funny state that you would
.\" like to ``snapshot'' and analyze later.
.It Fl n
option avoids the sync.  It can be used if a disk or the processor
is on fire. 
.It Fl q
reboots quickly and ungracefully, without shutting down running
processes first.
.\" .It Fl s
.\" option reboots to single user mode.
.El
.Pp
.Nm Reboot
normally logs the reboot using
.Xr syslog 8
and places a shutdown record in the login accounting file (see
.Xr utmp 5 .
These actions are inhibited if the
.Fl n
or
.Fl q
options are present.
.Pp
.Sy Power fail and crash recovery.
Normally, the system will reboot itself at power-up or after crashes.
An automatic consistency check of the file systems will be performed,
and unless this fails, the system will resume multi-user operations.
