.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
allows a user or system administrator to manipulate and configure disks
in various ways.
It is used by specifying a disk to manipulate, the command
to perform, and any arguments the command may require.
.Sh COMMANDS
The following commands are supported:
.Pp
.Nm getcache
.Pp
Get and display the cache enables for the specified device.
.Pp
.Nm setcache
.Ar none | r | w | rw
.Op Ar save
.Pp
Set the cache enables for the specified device.
The enables are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It none
Disable all caches on the disk.
.It r
Enable the read cache, and disable all other caches on the disk.
.It w
Enable the write cache, and disable all other caches on the disk.
.It rw
Enable both the read and write caches on the disk.
.It save
If specified, and the cache enables are savable, saves the cache
enables in the disk's non-volatile parameter storage.
.El
.Pp
.Nm synccache
.Op Ar force
.Pp
Causes the cache on the disk to be synchronized, flushing all dirty
write cache blocks to the media.
If

if the kernel does not believe that there are any dirty cache blocks
in the disk's cache.
.Pp
.Nm keeplabel
.Op Ar yes | no
.Pp
Specify to keep or drop the in-core disklabel on the last close of
the disk device.
(Keep if

.Ar flush | list | retry
.Pp
Used for managing the kernel's bad sector list for wd* devices.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It flush
Clears the in kernel list of bad sectors.
.It list
Prints out the list of bad sector ranges recorded by the kernel.
