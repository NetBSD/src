.Sh NAME
.Nm ccd.conf
.Nd concatenated disk driver configuration file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ccd.conf
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file defines the configuration of concatenated disk devices, or ccds.
It is used by
.Xr ccdconfig 8
when invoked with the
.Fl C
option and at system boot time.
For more information about the concatenated disk driver, see
.Xr ccd 4 .
.Pp
Each line of the configuration file contains arguments as per the
.Fl c
argument to
.Xr ccdconfig 8 :
.Pp
.Bd -ragged -offset indent -compact
.Ar ccd
.Ar ileave
.Op Ar flags
.Ar dev
.Op Ar ...
.Ed
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width preserveX
.It Ar ccd
The name of the ccd.
.It Ar ileave
The interleave, expressed in units of
.Dv DEV_BSIZE .
For serial concatenation, specify
.Ql 0 .
.It Ar flags
The flags for the device, which may be represented as a decimal number,
a hexadecimal number, a comma-separated list of strings, or the word
.Dq none .
.It Ar dev Op Ar ...
The component partitions to be concatenated, which should be of type
.Dv FS_CCD .
.El
.Pp
A
.Sq #
is a comment, and everything to end of line is ignored.
A
.Sq \e
at the end of a line indicates that the next line should be concatenated
with the current.
A
.Sq \e
preceding any character (other than the end of line) prevents that
character's special meaning from taking effect.
