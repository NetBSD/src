.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to dynamically configure and unconfigure concatenated disk
devices, or ccds.
For more information about the ccd, see
.Xr ccd 4 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c
Configure a ccd.
This is the default behavior of
.Nm .
.It Fl C
Configure all ccd devices listed in the ccd configuration file.
.It Fl f Ar config_file
When configuring or unconfiguring all devices, read the file
.Pa config_file
instead of the default
.Pa /etc/ccd.conf .
.It Fl g
Dump the current ccd configuration in a format suitable
for use as the ccd configuration file.
If no arguments are specified, every configured ccd is dumped.
Otherwise, the configuration of each listed ccd is dumped.
.It Fl u
Unconfigure a ccd.
.It Fl U
Unconfigure all ccd devices listed the ccd configuration file.
.It Fl v
Causes
.Nm
to be verbose.
.El
.Pp
A ccd is described on the command line and in the ccd configuration
file by the name of the ccd, the interleave factor,
the ccd configuration flags, and a list of one or more devices.
An interleave factor of 0 means that the devices are
concatenated serially, not interleaved.
The flags may be represented as a decimal number, a hexadecimal number,
a comma-separated list of strings, or the word
.Dq none .
The flags are as follows:
.Bl -column -offset indent "CCDF_UNIFORM " "0x02 "
.It Em "Symbolic	Numeric	Comment"
.It CCDF_UNIFORM	0x02	Use uniform interleave.
The size of all components is clamped to that of the smallest component.
.It CCDF_NOLABEL	0x04	Ignore raw disklabel.
Useful when creating a new ccd.
.El
.Ss /etc/ccd.conf
The file
.Pa /etc/ccd.conf
is used to configure
.Nm
if
.Fl C
or
.Fl U
is used.
Each line of the configuration file contains arguments as per the
.Fl c
argument:
.Ar ccd
.Ar ileave
.Op Ar flags
.Ar dev
.Op Ar ...
.Pp
A
.Sq #
is a comment, and everything to end of line is ignored.
A
.Sq \e
at the end of a line indicates that the next line should be concatenated
with the current.
A
.Sq \e
preceding any character (other than the end of line) prevents that
character's special meaning from taking effect.
.Pp
See
.Sx EXAMPLES
for an example of
.Pa /etc/ccd.conf .
.Sh FILES
/etc/ccd.conf - default ccd configuration file.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following command, executed from the command line, would configure ccd0
with 4 components (/dev/sd2e, /dev/sd3e, /dev/sd4e, /dev/sd5e), and an
interleave factor of 32 blocks.
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
# ccdconfig ccd0 32 0 /dev/sd2e /dev/sd3e /dev/sd4e /dev/sd5e
.Ed
.Pp
An example
.Pa /etc/ccd.conf :
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
#
# /etc/ccd.conf
# Configuration file for concatenated disk devices
#
.Pp
# ccd           ileave  flags   component devices
ccd0            16      none    /dev/sd2e /dev/sd3e
