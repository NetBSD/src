.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to configure and unconfigure cryptographic disk devices (cgds)
and to maintain the configuration files that are associated with them.
For more information about cryptographic disk devices see
.Xr cgd 4 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width configfilexxxx
.It Fl C
Configure all the devices listed in the cgd configuration file.
.It Fl f Ar configfile
Specify the configuration file explicitly, rather than using the default
configuration file
.Pa /etc/cgd/cgd.conf .
.It Fl G
Generate a new paramsfile (to stdout) using the values from
.Ar paramsfile
which will generate the same key.
This may need to prompt for multiple passphrases.
.It Fl g
Generate a paramsfile (to stdout).
.It Fl i Ar ivmeth
Specify the IV method (default: encblkno).
.It Fl k Ar kgmeth
Specify the key generation method (default: pkcs5_pbkdf2).
.It Fl o Ar outfile
When generating a
.Ar paramsfile ,
store it in
.Ar outfile .
.It Fl s
Read the key from stdin.
.It Fl U
Unconfigure all the devices listed in the cgd configuration file.
.It Fl u
Unconfigure a cgd.
.It Fl V Ar vmeth
Specify the verification method (default: none).
.It Fl v
Be verbose.
May be specified multiple times.
.El
.Pp
For more information about the cryptographic algorithms and IV methods
supported, please refer to
.Xr cgd 4 .
.Ss Key Generation Methods
To generate the key which it will use,
.Nm
evaluates all of the key generation methods in the parameters file
and uses the exclusive-or of the outputs of all the methods.
The methods and descriptions are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indentxxxxxx
.It pkcs5_pbkdf2
This method requires a passphrase which is entered at configuration
time.
It is a salted hmac-based scheme detailed in
.Dq PKCS#5 v2.0: Password-Based Cryptography Standard ,
RSA Laboratories, March 25, 1999, pages 8-10.
PKCS #5 was also republished as RFC 2898.
.It randomkey
The method simply reads
.Pa /dev/random
and uses the resulting bits as the key.
It does not require a passphrase to be entered.
This method is typically used to present disk devices that do not
need to survive a reboot, such as the swap partition.
It is also handy to facilitate overwriting the contents of
a disk volume with meaningless data prior to use.
.It storedkey
This method stores its key in the parameters file.
.El
.Pp
.Ss Verification Method
The verification method is how
.Nm
determines if the generated key is correct.
If the newly configured disk fails to verify, then
.Nm
will regenerate the key and re-configure the device.
It only makes sense to specify a verification method if at least of the
key generation methods is error prone, e.g. uses a user-entered passphrase.
The following verification methods are supported:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indentxxx -compact
.It none
perform no verification.
.It disklabel
scan for a valid disklabel.
.It ffs
scan for a valid FFS file system.
.El
.Ss /etc/cgd/cgd.conf
The file
.Pa /etc/cgd/cgd.conf
is used to configure
.Nm
if either of
.Fl C
or
.Fl U
are specified.
Each line of the file is composed of either two or three
tokens: cgd, target, and optional paramsfile.
.Pp
A
.Sq \&#
character is interpreted as a comment and indicates that the
rest of the line should be ignored.
A
.Sq \e
at the end of a line indicates that the next line is a continuation of
the current line.
.Pp
See
.Sx EXAMPLES
for an example of
.Pa /etc/cgd/cgd.conf .
.Ss Parameters File
The Parameters File contains the required information to generate the
key and configure a device.
These files are typically generated by the
.Fl g
flag and not edited by hand.
When a device is configured the default parameters file is constructed
by taking the basename of the target disk and prepending
.Pa /etc/cgd/
to it.
E.g., if the target is
.Pa /dev/sd0h ,
then the default parameters file will be
.Pa /etc/cgd/sd0h .
.Pp
It is possible to have more than one parameters file for a given
disk which use different key generation methods but will generate
the same key.
To create a parameters file that is equivalent to an existing parameters
file, use
.Nm
with the
.Fl G
flag.
See
.Sx EXAMPLES
for an example of this usage.
.Pp
The parameters file contains a list of statements each terminated
with a semi-colon.
Some statements can contain statement-blocks which are either a
single unadorned statement, or a brace-enclosed list of semicolon
terminated statements.
Three types of data are understood:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width integerxx
.It integer
a 32 bit signed integer.
.It string
a string.
.It base64
a length-encoded base64 string.
.El
.Pp
The following statements are defined:
.Bl -tag -width indentxx
.It algorithm Ar string
Defines the cryptographic algorithm.
.It iv-method Ar string
Defines the IV generation method.
.It keylength Ar integer
Defines the length of the key.
.It verify_method Ar string
Defines the verification method.
.It keygen Ar string Ar statement_block
Defines a key generation method.
The
.Ar statement_block
contains statements that are specific to the key generation method.
.El
.Pp
The keygen statement's statement block may contain the following statements:
.Bl -tag -width indentxx
.It key Ar string
The key.  Only used for the storedkey key generation method.
.It iterations Ar integer
The number of iterations.  Only used for pkcs5_pbkdf2.
.It salt Ar base64
The salt.  Only used for pkcs5_pbkdf2.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width indentxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx -compact
.It Pa /etc/cgd/
configuration directory, used to store paramsfiles.
.It Pa /etc/cgd/cgd.conf
cgd configuration file.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To set up and configure a cgd that uses AES with a 192 bit key
in CBC mode with the IV Method
.Sq encblkno
(encrypted block number):
.Bd -literal
	# cgdconfig -g -o /etc/cgd/wd0e aes-cbc 192
	# cgdconfig cgd0 /dev/wd0e
	/dev/wd0e's passphrase:
.Ed
.Pp
When using verification methods, the first time that we configure the
disk the verification method will fail.  We overcome this by supplying
.Fl V Ar none
when we configure the first time to set up the disk.  Here is the
sequence of commands that is recommended:
.Bd -literal
             # cgdconfig -g -o /dev/cgd/wd0e -V disklabel aes-cbc
             # cgdconfig -V none cgd0 /dev/wd0e
             /dev/wd0e's passphrase:
             # disklabel -e -I cgd0
             # cgdconfig -u cgd0
             # cgdconfig cgd0 /dev/wd0e
             /dev/wd0e's passphrase:
.Ed
.Pp
To create a new parameters file that will generate the same key as an old
parameters file:
.Bd -literal
             # cgdconfig -G -o newparamsfile oldparamsfile
             old file's passphrase:
             new file's passphrase:
.Ed
.Pp
To configure a cgd that uses Blowfish with a 200 bit key that it
reads from stdin:
.Bd -literal
	# cgdconfig -s cgd0 /dev/sd0h blowfish-cbc 200
.Ed
.Pp
An example parameters file which uses PKCS#5 PBKDF2:
.Bd -literal
	algorithm aes-cbc;
	iv-method encblkno;
	keylength 128;
	verify_method none;
	keygen pkcs5_pbkdf2 {
		iterations 39361;
		salt AAAAgMoHiYonye6Kog \\
		     dYJAobCHE=;
	};
.Ed
.Pp
An example parameters file which stores its key locally:
.Bd -literal
	algorithm       aes-cbc;
	iv-method       encblkno;
	keylength       256;
	verify_method   none;
	keygen storedkey key AAABAK3QO6d7xzLfrXTdsgg4 \\
			     ly2TdxkFqOkYYcbyUKu/f60L;
.Ed
.Pp
An example
.Pa /etc/cgd/cgd.conf :
.Bd -literal
	#
	# /etc/cgd/cgd.conf
	# Configuration file for cryptographic disk devices
	#

	# cgd		target		[paramsfile]
	cgd0		/dev/wd0e
	cgd1		/dev/sd0h	/usr/local/etc/cgd/sd0h
.Ed
.Pp
Note that this will store the parameters file as
.Pa /etc/cgd/wd0e .
And use the entered passphrase to generate the key.
