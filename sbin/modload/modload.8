.Dt MODLOAD 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm modload
.Nd load a kernel module
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl fP
.Op Fl b Ar var=boolean
.Op Fl i Ar var=integer
.Op Fl s Ar var=string
.Ar module
.Nm
.Fl p
.Op Fl b Ar var=boolean
.Op Fl d Ar var
.Op Fl i Ar var=integer
.Op Fl m Ar plist
.Op Fl s Ar var=string
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility loads a kernel module specified by the
.Ar module
parameter into the running system.
.Pp
Modules are loaded from the default system module areas unless the
.Ar module
parameter contains a path separator character
.Pq Sq / .
.Pp
The options to
.Nm
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width xbxvarxbooleanx
.It Fl b Ar var=boolean
Pass the module a boolean property with the name
.Ar var .
.Ar boolean
may be either
.Dv true
or
.Dv false .
.It Fl d Ar var
When used in conjunction with
.Fl m ,
delete
.Ar var
from the
.Ar plist
specified.
.It Fl f
When a module is loaded, the kernel checks if the module is compatible
with the running kernel and will refuse to load modules that are
potentially incompatible.
This option disables compatibility checks.
.Em Note :
an incompatible module can cause system instability, including data
loss or corruption.
.Pp
This option is also required for re-enabling a builtin module that
was disabled using
.Xr modunload 8 .
.It Fl i Ar var=integer
Pass the module an integer property with the name
.Ar var
and integral value
.Ar integer .
.It Fl m Ar plist
When used in conjunction with
.Fl p ,
merge new options with an existing property list contained in
.Ar plist .
.It Fl P
This option tells the kernel not to load an associated property list.
.It Fl p
Output a property list suitable for loading along with a module.
When using this option, you do not need to specify a module.
Use
.Fl m
and
.Fl d
to read and modify an existing property list.
.It Fl s Ar var=string
Pass the module a string property with the name
.Ar var
and string value
.Ar string .
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Nm
utility exits with a status of 0 on success
and with a nonzero status if an error occurs.

.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Nx 0.9 .
The
.Nm
command was designed to be similar in functionality
to the corresponding command in
.Tn "SunOS 4.1.3" .
.Nm
was switched to the module framework for
.Nx 5.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The original
.Nx
implementation was written by
.An Terrence R. Lambert Aq Mt terry@cs.weber.edu .
The switch to the module framework was by
.An Andrew Doran Aq Mt ad@NetBSD.org .
