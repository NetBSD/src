.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility loads a kernel module specified by the
.Ar module
paramamter into the running system.
.Pp
The current working directory is first searched for the module object file.

.It Fl b Ar name=val
Pass the module a boolean property with the name
.Ar name .
.Ar val
may be either
.Dv true
or
.Dv false .
.It Fl f
When a module is loaded, the kernel checks if the module is compatible
with the running kernel and will refuse to load modules that are
potentially incompatible.
This option disables compatibility checks.
.Em Note :
an incompatible module can cause system instability, including data
loss or corruption.
.It Fl i Ar name=val
Pass the module an integer property with the name
.Ar name
and integral value
.Ar val .
.It Fl p
Output a property list suitable for loading along with a module.

.Ar name
and string value
