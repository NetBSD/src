.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_puffs
.Nd helper utility for mounting puffs/refuse file systems
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl o Ar options
.Ar program Ns Op # Ns Ar source
.Ar mount_point
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility simply executes the given
.Ar program ,
allowing to mount
.Xr puffs 4
and
.Xr refuse 3
based file systems via
.Ic mount -a
or the
.Xr fstab 5
file.
.Pp
This command is usually only executed by
.Xr mount 8 ,
as users can directly execute file servers to mount them.
The
.Ar program
parameter is either the path to the file server or the file name of
it.
In the latter case the
.Ar program
is searched in the
.Ev PATH
variable.
The
.Ar source
parameter, when specified, will be passed to the
.Ar program
as its first non-option argument, with
.Ar mount_point
being the second one.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl o
Options are specified with a
.Fl o
flag followed by a comma separated string of options.
They are passed to the
.Ar program
without any modifications except for
.Cm getargs ,
which is typically used by
.Ic mount -vv .
When there is
.Cm getargs
in the list,
.Nm
discards all the other options and prints the kernel arguments for a
.Xr puffs 4
file system already mounted at
.Ar mount_point .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Mount
.Ic dmesgfs
at
.Pa /dmesg :
.Dl # mount_puffs dmesgfs /dmesg
.Pp
Or in
.Xr fstab 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
dmesgfs  /dmesg  puffs  rw
.Ed
.Pp
These are equivalent to:
.Dl # dmesgfs /dmesg
.Pp
Mount
.Pa /usr/bin/rot13fs
for
.Pa /home/foo
at
.Pa /mnt/rot13
with option
.Fl o Cm rdonly :
.Dl # mount_puffs -o rdonly /usr/bin/rot13fs#/home/foo /mnt/rot13
.Pp
Or in
.Xr fstab 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
/usr/bin/rot13fs#/home/foo  /mnt/rot13  puffs  rdonly
.Ed
.Pp
These are equivalent to:
.Dl # /usr/bin/rot13fs -o rdonly /home/foo /mnt/rot13
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr refuse 3 ,
.Xr puffs 4 ,
.Xr fusermount 8 ,
.Xr mount 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Nx 6.0 .
