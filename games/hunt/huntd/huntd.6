.Dt HUNTD 6
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm huntd
.Nd hunt daemon, back-end for hunt game
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl s
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
controls the multi-player
.Xr hunt 6
game.
When it starts up, it tries to notify all members of the
.Em hunt-players
mailing list (see
.Xr sendmail 8 )
by faking a
.Xr talk 1
request from user
.Dq Hunt Game .
.Pp
The
.Fl s
option is for running
.Nm
forever (server mode).
This is similar to running it under the control of
.Xr inetd 8
(see below), but it consumes a process table entry when no one is playing.
.Pp
The
.Fl p
option changes the UDP port number used to rendezvous with the player
process and thus allows for private games of hunt.
This option turns off the notification of players on the
.Em hunt-players
mailing list.
.Ss INETD
To run
.Nm
from
.Xr inetd 8 ,
you'll need to
.\"put the
.\".Nm hunt
.\"service in
.\".Pa /etc/services :
.\".Bd -literal
.\"hunt 26740/udp		# multi-player/multi-host mazewars
.\".Ed
.\"and
uncomment the following line in
.Pa /etc/inetd.conf :
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
hunt dgram udp wait nobody /usr/games/huntd huntd
.Ed
Do not use any of the command line options; if you want
.Xr inetd 8
to start up
.Nm
on a private port, change the port listed for
.Nm hunt
in
.Pa /etc/services .
.Sh NETWORK RENDEZVOUS
When
.Xr hunt 6
starts up, it broadcasts on the local area net
(using the broadcast address for each interface) to find a
.Nm hunt
game in progress.
If a
.Nm
hears the request, it sends back the port number for the
.Nm hunt
process to connect to.
Otherwise, the
.Nm hunt
process starts up a
.Nm
on the local machine and tries to rendezvous with it.
