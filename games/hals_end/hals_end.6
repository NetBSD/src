it's source code and output illustrates the article
"Remembering the Future: Memory and Interaction" by Dr. Regine Halter.
The source code was set in contrast to the graphical artwork "HAL's lifespace"
by Catherine Walthard.
"HAL's Lifespace" and "hals_end" were respectively designed and written for
this article.

.Sh BUGS
Unlike the real HAL, this program can be repeately run.
There should be functionality in the program to destroy itself after one run.
The rationale for not doing this right now is that the movie itself can be
watched several times as well.
