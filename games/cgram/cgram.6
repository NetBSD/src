.Sh NAME
.Nm cgram
.Nd solve Sunday-paper cryptograms
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a curses-based widget for solving Sunday-paper-type cryptograms
based on substitution ciphers.
A random cleartext is chosen using
.Xr fortune 6
and a random substitution key is generated.
.Pp
The ciphertext is displayed.
Typing a letter changes the key so that the letter under the cursor
maps to the newly typed letter, and updates the display accordingly.
Use Emacs-type cursor commands to move around.
Enter a tilde
.Pq ~
to quit.
Press asterisk
.Pq *
to enter an easier mode where correct letters are displayed in
boldface.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr caesar 6
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
was written circa 2004.
It was imported into
.Nx
in 2013 and first appeared in
.Nx 7.0 .
