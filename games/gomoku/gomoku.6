.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a two player game where the object is to get 5 in a row horizontally,
vertically or diagonally on a 19 by 19 grid.
By convention, black always moves first.
.Pp
The options are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
Run in batch mode.
.Pq See below.
.It Fl c
Computer versus computer.
.Nm
will play a game against itself.
This is mostly used for testing.
.It Fl d
Print debugging information.
Repeating this option more than once yields more detailed information.
.It Fl D Ar debugfile
Print the debug information to
.Ar debugfile
instead of to the standard output.
.It Fl u
User versus user.
.Pq Play against yourself.
This is mostly used for testing.
.It Ar savefile

.Pa savefile .
.El
.Pp
With no arguments,
.Nm
starts a fresh user vs. computer game.
.Pp
Moves may be entered by selecting the desired board location and
pressing the space or enter key.
The cursor may be moved using the arrow keys or
.Xr vi 1
motion keys
.Em hjklyubn .
These also may be familiar from
.Xr rogue 6
and
.Xr hack 6 .
.\" Valid moves are a letter for the column and a number for the row
.\" of an empty board location.
To quit, type
.Sq Q ,
and to save the game, type
.Sq S
and supply a file name when prompted.
.Ss Batch mode
Batch mode was intended for game tournaments where a referee program
handles the board display and pits one program against another.
In this mode,
.Nm
reads moves from standard input and writes its responses to standard
output.
The first line of input should be either
.Dq black
or
.Dq white
to specify whether
.Nm
has the first move or not respectively.

.Sh ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The board display routines were based on the
.Nm goref
program written by Peter Langston.
The user interface was based on Eric S. Raymond's interface for
