A computer called Illiac4
Had a rather tough bug in its core.
	It chewed up its cards
	And spewed yards and yards
Of illegible tape on the floor.

A computer, to print out a fact,
Will divide, multiply, and subtract.
	But this output can be
	No more than debris,
If the input was short of exact.

A dreary young bank clerk named Fennis
Wished to foster an aura of menace;
	To make people afraid
	He wore gloves of grey suede
And white footgear intended for tennis.

A hacker who screwed a mag tape
Was caught and convicted of rape.
	To jail he did go,
	From which, to his woe
He couldn't get out with ESC.

A linguist thought it a farce
That memory space was so sparse.
	One day they increased it.
	Said he as he seized it:
"At last! Enough core for the parse".

A progressive professor named Winners
Held classes each evening for sinners.
	They were graded and spaced
	So the vile and debased
Would not be held back by beginners.

A very intelligent turtle
Found programming UNIX a hurdle
	The system, you see,
	Ran as slow as did he,
And that's not saying much for the turtle.

There was a young lady from Niger
Who smiled as she rode on a tiger;
	They returned from the ride
	With the lady inside,
And the smile on the face of the tiger.

A wonderful bird is the pelican.
His mouth can hold more than his belican.
	He can take in his beak
	Enough food for a week.
And I'm darned if I know how the helican.
