.Sh NAME
.Nm ching
.Nd the book of changes and other cookies
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op hexagram
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Em I Ching
or
.Em Book of Changes
is an ancient Chinese oracle that has been in use for centuries
as a source of wisdom and advice.
.Pp
The text of the
.Em oracle
(as it is sometimes known) consists of sixty-four
.Em hexagrams ,
each symbolized by a particular arrangement of six straight (\-\-\-)
and broken (\-\ \-) lines.  These lines have values ranging
from six through nine, with the even values indicating the broken lines.
.Pp
Each hexagram consists of two major sections.  The
.Sy Judgement
relates specifically to the matter at hand
.Po e.g. ,
.Dq It furthers one to have somewhere to go.
.Pc
while the
.Sy Image
describes the general attributes of the hexagram and how they apply
to one's own life
.Pq Dq Thus the superior man makes himself strong and untiring.
.Pp
When any of the lines have the values six or nine, they are moving
lines; for each there is an appended judgement which becomes
significant.
Furthermore, the moving lines are inherently unstable
and change into their opposites; a second hexagram (and thus an
additional judgement) is formed.
.Pp
Normally, one consults the oracle by fixing the desired question
firmly in mind and then casting a set of changes (lines)
using yarrow\-stalks or tossed coins.  The resulting hexagram
will be the answer to the question.
.Pp
Using an algorithm suggested by S. C. Johnson, the
.Ux
.Em oracle
simply reads a question from the standard input (up to an EOF) and
hashes the individual characters in combination with the time of
day, process id and any other magic numbers which happen to be
lying around the system.
The resulting value is used as the seed of a random
number generator which drives a simulated coin\-toss divination.
The answer is then piped through
.Xr nroff 1
for formatting and will appear on the standard output.
.Pp
For those who wish to remain steadfast in the old traditions, the
oracle will also accept the results of a personal divination using,
for example, coins.
To do this, cast the change and then type the
resulting line values as an argument.
.Pp
The impatient modern may prefer to settle for Chinese cookies; try
.Xr fortune 6 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The great prince issues commands,
.Pp
Founds states, vests families with fiefs.
.Pp
Inferior people should not be employed.
.Sh SEE ALSO
It furthers one to see the great man.
.Sh BUGS
Waiting in the mud
.Pp
Brings about the arrival of the enemy.
.Pp
If one is not extremely careful,
.Pp
Somebody may come up from behind and strike him.
.Pp
Misfortune.
