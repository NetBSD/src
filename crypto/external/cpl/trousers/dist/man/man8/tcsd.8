.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Trousers is an open-source TCG Software Stack (TSS), released under the Common 
Public License. Trousers aims to be compliant with the current (1.1b) and 
upcoming (1.2) TSS specifications available from the Trusted Computing Group 
website: http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org.

\fBtcsd\fR is a user space daemon that should be (according to the TSS spec)
the only portal to the TPM device driver. At boot time, \fBtcsd\fR should 
be started, it should open the TPM device driver and from that point on, all 
requests to the TPM should go through the TSS stack. The \fBtcsd\fR manages TPM
resources and handles requests from TSP's both local and remote.

.TP
\fB\-f\fR
run the daemon in the foreground

\fB\-c <configfile>\fR
use the provided configuration file rather than the default configuration file

.SH "ACCESS CONTROL"
.PP
There are two types of access control for the \fBtcsd\fR, access to the
daemon's socket itself and access to specific commands internal to the
\fBtcsd\fR. Access to the \fBtcsd\fR's port should be controlled by the system
administrator using firewall rules.  If using iptables, the following rule
will allow a specific host access to the tcsd:

# iptables -A INPUT -s $IP_ADDRESS -p tcp --destination-port 30003 -j ACCEPT

Access to individual commands internal to the tcsd is configured by the
\fBtcsd\fR configuration file's "remote_ops" directive. Each function call
in the TCS API is reachable by a unique ordinal.  Each labeled "remote op"
actually defines a set of ordinals (usually more than one) necessary to
accomplish the operation. So, for example, the "random" operation enables
the ordinals for opening and closing a context, calling TCS_StirRandom
and TCS_GetRandom, as well as TCS_FreeMemory. By default, connections from
localhost will allow any ordinals.

.SH "DATA FILES"
.PP
TSS applications have access to 2 different kinds of 'persistant' storage. 'User' 
persistant storage has the lifetime of that of the application using it 
and therefore is destroyed when an application exits.  User PS is controlled 
by the TSP of the application.  'System' persistent storage is controlled by 
the TCS and stays valid across application lifetimes, \fBtcsd\fR restarts and 
system resets. Data registered in system PS stays valid until an application 
requests that it be removed. User PS files are by default stored as 
/var/tpm/user.{pid} and the system PS file by default is /var/tpm/system.data. 
The system PS file is initially created when ownership of the TPM is first 
taken.

.SH "CONFIGURATION"
\fBtcsd\fR configuration is stored by default in /etc/tcsd.conf

.SH "DEBUG OUTPUT"
If TrouSerS has been compiled with debugging enabled, the debugging output
can be supressed by setting the TSS_DEBUG_OFF environment variable.

.SH "DEVICE DRIVERS"
.PP
\fBtcsd\fR is compatible with the IBM Research TPM device driver available
from http://www.research.ibm.com/gsal/tcpa and the TPM device driver available
from http://sf.net/projects/tmpdd

.SH "CONFORMING TO"

\fBtcsd\fR conforms to the Trusted Computing Group Software
Specification version 1.1 Golden
