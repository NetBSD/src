.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\Tspi_TPM_DAA_JoinCreateDaaPubKey\fR
is the second (between \fBTspi_TPM_DAA_JoinInit()\fR and \fBTspi_TPM_DAA_JoinStoreCredential()\fR)
 out of 3 functions to execute in order to receive a DAA Credential.
It computes the credential request for the DAA Issuer, which also includes the Platforms's
DAA public key and the attributes that were chosen by the Platform, and which are not visible
to the DAA Issuer. The Platform can commit to the attribute values it has chosen.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.PP
.SS hDAA
The \fIhDAA\fR parameter is used to specify the handle of the DAA object.
.SS hTPM
The \fIhTPM\fR parameter is the handle to the TPM object.
.SS authenticationChallengeLength
The \fIauthenticationChallengeLength\fR parameter is length of authenticationChallenge (256 bytes - DAA_SIZE_NE1).
.SS authenticationChallenge
The \fIauthenticationChallenge\fR parameter is the second nonce of the DAA Issuer that is encrypted by the endorsement public key.
It is used as a challenge to authenticate the underlying TPM.
.SS nonceIssuerLength
The \fInonceIssuerLength\fR parameter is the length of nonceIssuer (20 bytes).
.SS nonceIssuer
The \fInonceIssuer\fR parameter is the nonce of the DAA Issuer.
.SS attributesPlatformLength
The \fIattributesPlatformLength\fR parameter is length of attributesPlatform array, which is determined
by the DAA Issuer public key (). The length of a single attribute is ln/8. ln is defined as the size of
the RSA modulus (2048).
.SS attributesPlatform
The \fIattributesPlatform\fR parameter is an array of attributes to be encoded into the DAA Credential
not visible to the DAA Issuer.
.SS joinSession
The \fIjoinSession\fR parameter is a structure containing the DAA Join session information.
.SS credentialRequest
The \fIcredentialRequest\fR parameter is the credential request of the Platform, it contains the blinded
DAA public key of the platform on which the DAA Issuer will issue the credential the blinded attributes
chosen by the Platform.

.SH "RETURN CODES"
.PP
\fBTspi_TPM_DAA_JoinCreateDaaPubKey\fR returns TSS_SUCCESS on success, otherwise one of the
following values is returned:
.TP
.SM TSS_E_INVALID_HANDLE
Either the DAA is not valid.
.TP
.SM TSS_E_BAD_PARAMETER
.TP
.SM TSS_E_INTERNAL_ERROR
An internal SW error has been detected.

.SH "CONFORMING TO"
.PP
\fBTspi_TPM_DAA_JoinCreateDaaPubKey\fR conforms to the Trusted Computing Group
Software Specification version 1.2
