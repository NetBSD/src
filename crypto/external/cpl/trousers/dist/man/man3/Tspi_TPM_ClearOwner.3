.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBTspi_TPM_ClearOwner\fR
wipes the TPM of everything but its endorsement key. It will wipe the SRK, so
anything locked to the SRK will also disappear when this command is executed.
This is the only way to be certain that keys are gone, as it is the only way
to guarantee that nothing can keep a copy of the key. You must assert either
physical presence or owner authorization in order to use this command.

.SH "PARAMETERS"
.PP
.SS hTPM
The \fIhTPM\fR parameter is used to specify the handle of the TPM object.
.SS fForcedClear
The \fIfForcedClear\fR parameter is used to tell whether this command is being
executed with owner authorization or with physical presence. If FALSE, then
TPM owner authorization is used. If TRUE, then physical presence is required
to clear the TPM.

.SH "RETURN CODES"
.PP
\fBTspi_TPM_ClearOwner\fR returns TSS_SUCCESS on success, otherwise one of the
following values is returned:
.TP
.SM TSS_E_INVALID_HANDLE
\fIhTPM\fR is not a valid handle.

.TP
.SM TSS_E_INTERNAL_ERROR
An internal SW error has been detected.

.SH "CONFORMING TO"
