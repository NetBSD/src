#  device driver.

# Option: kernel_log_file
# Values: Any absolute directory path
# Description: Path to the file containing the current kernel PCR event
#  log data. By default, this data will be parsed in the format provided
#  by the Integrity Measurement Architecture LSM. See

#
#
# kernel_log_file = /sys/kernel/security/ima/binary_runtime_measurements
#

# Option: firmware_pcrs
# Values: PCR indices, separated by commas (no whitespace)
# Description: A list of PCR indices that are manipulated only by the system
#  firmware and therefore are not extended or logged by the TCSD.
#
# firmware_pcrs =
#

# Option: kernel_pcrs
# Values: PCR indices, separated by commas (no whitespace)
# Description: A list of PCR indices that are manipulated only by the kernel
#  and therefore are not extended or logged by the TCSD.
#
# kernel_pcrs =
#

# Option: platform_cred
# Values: Any absolute directory path (example: /path/to/platform.cert)
# Description: Path to the file containing your TPM's platform credential.
#  The platform credential may have been provided to you by your TPM
#  manufacturer. If so, set platform_cred to the path to the file on disk.
#  Whenever a new TPM identity is created, the credential will be used. See
#  Tspi_TPM_CollateIdentityRequest(3) for more information.
#
# platform_cred =
#

# Option: conformance_cred
# Values: Any absolute directory path (example: /path/to/conformance.cert)
# Description: Path to the file containing your TPM's conformance credential.
#  The conformance credential may have been provided to you by your TPM
#  manufacturer. If so, set conformance_cred to the path to the file on disk.
#  Whenever a new TPM identity is created, the credential will be used. See
#  Tspi_TPM_CollateIdentityRequest(3) for more information.
#
# conformance_cred =
#

# Option: endorsement_cred
# Values: Any absolute directory path (example: /path/to/endorsement.cert)
# Description: Path to the file containing your TPM's endorsement credential.
#  The endorsement credential may have been provided to you by your TPM
#  manufacturer. If so, set endorsement_cred to the path to the file on disk.
#  Whenever a new TPM identity is created, the credential will be used. See
#  Tspi_TPM_CollateIdentityRequest(3) for more information.
#
# endorsement_cred =
#

# Option: remote_ops
# Values: TCS operation names, separated by commas (no whitespace)
# Description: A list of TCS commands which will be allowed to be executed
#  on this machine's TCSD by TSP's on non-local hosts (over the internet).
#  By default, access to all operations is denied.
#
# possible values:  seal - encrypt data bound to PCR values
#		    unseal - decrypt data bound to PCR values
#		    registerkey - store keys in system persistent storage [Disk write access!]
#		    unregisterkey - remove keys from system persistent storage [Disk write access!]
#		    loadkey - load a key into the TPM
#		    createkey - create a key using the TPM
#		    sign - encrypt data using a private key
#		    random - generate random numbers
#		    getcapability - query the TCS/TPM for its capabilities
#		    unbind - decrypt data
#		    quote - request a signed blob containing all PCR values
#		    readpubek - access the TPM's Public EndorsementKey
#		    getregisteredkeybypublicinfo - Search system persistent storage for a public key
#		    getpubkey - Retrieve a loaded key's public data from inside the TPM
#		    selftest - execute selftest and test results ordinals
#
# remote_ops =
#

# Option: enforce_exclusive_transport
# Values: 0 or 1
# Description: When an application opens a transport session with the TPM, one
#  of the options available is an "exclusive" session, meaning that the TPM
#  will not execute any commands other than those coming through the transport
#  session for the lifetime of the session. The TCSD can choose to enforce this
#  option or not. By default, exclusive sessions are not enforced, since this
#  could allow for a denial of service to the TPM.
#
#  enforce_exclusive_transport = 0
#

# Option: host_platform_class
# Values: One of the TCG platform class specifications
#	PC_11 - PC Client System, version 1.1
#	PC_12 - PC Client System, version 1.2
#	PDA_12 - PDA System, version 1.2
#	SERVER_12 - Server System, version 1.2
#	MOBILE_12 - Mobile Phone System, version 1.2
#
# Description: This option determines the host platform (host the TCS system
# is running on) class, among those specified by the Trusted Computing group
# on https://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/specs/. This class will be reported
# by the TCS daemon when an application queries it using the
# TSS_TCSCAP_PROP_HOST_PLATFORM sub-capability. The default is PC_12.
#
# host_platform_class = PC_12
#

# Option: all_platform_classes
# Values: TCG Platform class names, separated by commas (no whitespaces)
#	PC_11 - PC Client System, version 1.1
#	PC_12 - PC Client System, version 1.2
#	PDA_12 - PDA System, version 1.2
#	SERVER_12 - Server System, version 1.2
#	MOBILE_12 - Mobile Phone System, version 1.2
#
# Description: This option determines all the platform classes supported by the
# TCS daemon. This list must not include the value set as "host_platform_class"
# specified above. Since by default TrouSerS supports all TPM 1.2 functionality,
# the default is all 1.2 and 1.1 platform classes.
#
# all_platform_classes = PC_11,PDA_12,SERVER_12,MOBILE_12
