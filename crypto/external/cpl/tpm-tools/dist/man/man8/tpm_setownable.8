TPM Management - tpm_setownable 
.SH NAME
tpm_setownable \- change whether the TPM allows tpm_takeownership operations 
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.ad l
.hy 0
.B tpm_setownable
.RB [ OPTION ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBtpm_setownable\fR reports the status of the TPM's flags regarding if the TPM can be owned.  This is the default behavior and also accessible via the \fB\-\-status\fR option. Requesting a report of this status prompts for the owner password.  The \fB\-\-allow\fR option sets the system's TPM to allow tpm_takeownership operations  
(via the TPM_SetOwnerInstall API).  This operation requires physical presence.  The \fB\-\-prevent\fR 
option (via the TPM_SetOwnerInstall API) prevents the TPM from accepting tpm_takeownership operations.  This operation requires physical presence.  These operations are persistent.  tpm_takeownership requires the tpm be enabled.
