.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBtpm_setactive\fR reports the status of the TPM's flags regarding the active state of the TPM.  This is the default behavior and also accessible via the \fB\-\-status\fR option. Requesting a report of this status prompts for the owner password.  The \fB\-\-active\fR option changes the TPM to the active state  
(via the TPM_PhysicalSetDeactivated API).  This operation requires evidence of physical presence, is persistent and requires a reboot to take effect. The \fB\-\-inactive\fR 
option (via the TPM_PhysicalSetDeactivated API) changes the TPM to the inactive state.  This operation requires evidence of physical presence, is persistent and requires a reboot to take effect.  An inactive TPM is essentially off but still allows for a tpm_takeownership to occur.  The \fB\-\-temp\fR option causes deactivation (via the TPM_SetTempDeactivated API) to happen immediately but only endure for the current boot cycle.  The \fB\-\-status\fR, \fB\-\-active\fR, \fB\-\-inactive\fR, and \fB\-\-temp\fR options are mutually exclusive and the last one on the command line will be carried out.

.TP
\fB-s\fR, \fB\-\-status\fR
Report the status of flags regarding the TPM active states. 
.TP
\fB-a\fR, \fB\-\-active\fR
Make the TPM active.  Operation is persistent, requires phyiscal presence to authorize, and a reboot to take effect. 
.TP
\fB-i\fR, \fB\-\-inactive\fR
Make the TPM inactive.   Operation is persistent, requires phyiscal presence to authorize, and a reboot to take effect.
.TP
\fB-t\fR, \fB\-\-temp\fR
Makes the TPM inactive for the current boot cycle only. 
.TP
\fB-z\fR, \fB\-\-well-known\fR
Authenticate using 20 bytes of zeros as owner password (the default TSS Well Known Secret), instead of prompting for an owner password.
