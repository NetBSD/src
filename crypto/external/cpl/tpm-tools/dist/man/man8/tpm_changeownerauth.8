.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBtpm_changeownerauth\fR allows for changing the authorization data for the TPM owner or the TPM's Storage Root Key  
(via the TPM_ChangeAuthOwner API).  This operation prompts for current password, followed by the new password and a confirmation of the new password. The \fB\-\-owner\fR option changes the TPM owner password and \fB\-\-srk\fR option changes the TPM's SRK password. The \fB\-\-well-known\fR option is used when SRK or owner passwords need to be changed and current owner password is a secret of zeros, \fB\-\-set-well-known\fR option changes current password to a secret of zeros, both options do not work by themselves, they must be used with \fB\-\-owner\fR and \fB\-\-srk\fR options to indicate which of these passwords will be changed.
