.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBtpm_setclearable\fR reports the status of the TPM's flags regarding how the TPM can be cleared.  This is the default behavior and also accessible via the \fB\-\-status\fR option. Requesting a report of this status prompts for the owner password.  The \fB\-\-owner\fR option requests that the TPM disable clear operations  
(via the TPM_DisableOwnerClear API) disabling the owner from clearing out the ownership information.  This operation prompts for the owner password.  This operation is in effect until the current owner is cleared.  The \fB\-\-force\fR 
option (via the TPM_DisableForceClear API) disables using Phyiscal Presence to authorize a clear operation.  This operation does not require authorization and will skip the owner password prompt.  This operation is only in effect until a reboot.
