.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBtpm_restrictpubek\fR reports the status of who can display the public portion of the Endorsement Key.  This is the default behavior and also available with the \fB\-\-status\fR option.  This operation will be in effect until the owner is cleared and prompts for the owner passord. With the \fB\-\-restrict\fR option, the ability to display the public portion of the Endorsement Key is resticted to the owner 
(via the TPM_DisablePubekRead API).  The command prompts for the owner password to complete the operation.   The \fB\-\-status\fR and \fB\-\-restrict\fR options are mutually exclusive and the last one on the command line will be carried out.
