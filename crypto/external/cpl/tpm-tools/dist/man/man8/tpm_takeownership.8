.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBtpm_takeownership\fR setup an owner on the system's TPM 
(via the TPM_TakeOwnership API).  This operation requires the TPM to be enabled and can be restricted by tpm_setownable.  The command will prompt for owner and SRK passwords and confirmations of these if executed without either of the \fB\-well-known\fR options, otherwise, a secret of all zeros is set for the requested password.  After the second confirmation, be patient as the command may take awhile.
