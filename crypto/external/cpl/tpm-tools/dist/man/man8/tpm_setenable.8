.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBtpm_setenable\fR reports the status of the TPM's flags regarding the enable state of the TPM.  This is the default behavior and also accessible via the \fB\-\-status\fR option. Requesting a report of this status prompts for the owner password.  The \fB\-\-enable\fR option changes the system's TPM to the enabled state  
(via the TPM_OwnerSetDisable API).  This operation prompts for the owner password and is persistent. The \fB\-\-disable\fR 
option (via the TPM_OwnerSetDisable API) changes the system's TPM to the disabled state.  This operation prompts for the owner password and is persistent.  A disabled TPM is essentially off and does not allow a tpm_takeownership to occur.  The \fB\-\-force\fR option overrides the owner password prompt and relies on physical presence for the operation authorization (via the TPM_PhysicalEnable and TPM_PhysicalDisable APIs).  The \fB\-\-enable\fR, \fB\-\-disable\fR, and \fB\-\-status\fR options are mutually exclusive and the last one on the command line will be carried out.
