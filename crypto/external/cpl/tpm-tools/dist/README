 DESCRIPTION
 -----------
 tpm-tools is an open-source package designed to enable user and application
 enablement of Trusted Computing using a Trusted Platform Module (TPM),
 similar to a smart card environment.  Trusted Computing is a set of
 specifications set forth by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG).  For more
 information on the TCG and Trusted Computing please visit the Trusted
 Computing Group website at:
   http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org.

 The tpm-tools package contains commands to allow the platform administrator
 the ability to manage and diagnose the platform's TPM.  Additionally, the
 package contains commands to utilize some of the capabilities available
 in the TPM PKCS#11 interface implemented in the openCryptoki project.

 The tpm-tools package is released under the Common Public License.
