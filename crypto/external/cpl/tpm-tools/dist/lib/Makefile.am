# Libtool -version-info flag usage rules
# This flag accepts an argument of the form current[:revision[:age]]. 
# So, passing -version-info 3:12:1 sets current to 3, revision to 12, and age to 1.
# If either revision or age are omitted, they default to 0. Also note that age must 
# be less than or equal to the current interface number.
# Here are a set of rules to help you update your library version information:
#   1. Start with version information of 0:0:0 for each libtool library.
#   2. Update the version information only immediately before a public release of your 
#	software. More frequent updates are unnecessary, and only guarantee that the 
#	current interface number gets larger faster.
#   3. If the library source code has changed at all since the last update, then 
#	increment revision (c:r:a becomes c:r+1:a).
#   4. If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the last update, 
#	increment current, and set revision to 0.
#   5. If any interfaces have been added since the last public release, then increment age.
#   6. If any interfaces have been removed since the last public release, then set age to 0.
