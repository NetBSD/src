.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
OpenSSL supports a range of x86[_64] instruction set extensions. These
extensions are denoted by individual bits in capability vector returned
by processor in EDX:ECX register pair after executing CPUID instruction
with EAX=1 input value (see Intel Application Note #241618). This vector
is copied to memory upon toolkit initialization and used to choose
between different code paths to provide optimal performance across wide
range of processors. For the moment of this writing following bits are
significant:
.IP "bit #4 denoting presence of Time-Stamp Counter." 4

For example, in 32\-bit application context clearing bit #26 at run-time
disables high-performance SSE2 code present in the crypto library, while
clearing bit #24 disables SSE2 code operating on 128\-bit XMM register
bank. You might have to do the latter if target OpenSSL application is
executed on SSE2 capable CPU, but under control of OS that does not
enable XMM registers. Historically address of the capability vector copy
was exposed to application through \fBOPENSSL_ia32cap_loc()\fR, but not
anymore. Now the only way to affect the capability detection is to set
\&\fBOPENSSL_ia32cap\fR environment variable prior target application start. To
give a specific example, on Intel P4 processor
\&\f(CW\*(C`env OPENSSL_ia32cap=0x16980010 apps/openssl\*(C'\fR, or better yet
\&\f(CW\*(C`env OPENSSL_ia32cap=~0x1000000 apps/openssl\*(C'\fR would achieve the desired
effect. Alternatively you can reconfigure the toolkit with no\-sse2
option and recompile.

Less intuitive is clearing bit #28, or ~0x10000000 in the "environment
variable" terms. The truth is that it's not copied from CPUID output
verbatim, but is adjusted to reflect whether or not the data cache is
actually shared between logical cores. This in turn affects the decision
on whether or not expensive countermeasures against cache-timing attacks
are applied, most notably in AES assembler module.

The capability vector is further extended with EBX value returned by
CPUID with EAX=7 and ECX=0 as input. Following bits are significant:

To control this extended capability word use \f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR as delimiter when
setting up \fBOPENSSL_ia32cap\fR environment variable. For example assigning
\&\f(CW\*(C`:~0x20\*(C'\fR would disable AVX2 code paths, and \f(CW\*(C`:0\*(C'\fR \- all post-AVX
extensions.
