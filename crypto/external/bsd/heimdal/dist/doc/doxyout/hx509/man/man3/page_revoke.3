page_revoke \- Revocation methods 
There are two revocation method for PKIX/X\&.509: CRL and OCSP\&. Revocation is needed if the private key is lost and stolen\&. Depending on how picky you are, you might want to make revocation for destroyed private keys too (smartcard broken), but that should not be a problem\&.
.PP
CRL is a list of certifiates that have expired\&.
.PP
OCSP is an online checking method where the requestor sends a list of certificates to the OCSP server to return a signed reply if they are valid or not\&. Some services sends a OCSP reply as part of the hand-shake to make the revoktion decision simpler/faster for the client\&.
