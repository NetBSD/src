.SH NAME
page_cert \- The basic certificate 
The basic hx509 cerificate object in hx509 is hx509_cert\&. The hx509_cert object is representing one X509/PKIX certificate and associated attributes; like private key, friendly name, etc\&.
.PP
A hx509_cert object is usully found via the keyset interfaces (\fBCertificate store operations\fP), but its also possible to create a certificate directly from a parsed object with \fBhx509_cert_init()\fP and \fBhx509_cert_init_data()\fP\&.
.PP
See the library functions here: \fBhx509 certificate functions\fP
