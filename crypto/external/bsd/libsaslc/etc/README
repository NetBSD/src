These are example configuration files that are supposed to be installed
in /etc/saslc.d/ and are used to configure saslc globally as well as its
different authentication mechanisms.

The tree hierarchy looks like:

Default and global configuration files:

    /etc/saslc.d/saslc/saslc.conf
    /etc/saslc.d/saslc/mechs/{ANONYMOUS,CRAM-MD5,DIGEST-MD5}.conf
    /etc/saslc.d/saslc/mechs/{EXTERNAL,GSSAPI,LOGIN,PLAIN}.conf

Custom configuration files for <program> (for example postfix):

    /etc/saslc.d/<program>/saslc.conf
    /etc/saslc.d/<program>/mechs/{ANONYMOUS,CRAM-MD5,DIGEST-MD5}.conf
    /etc/saslc.d/<program>/mechs/{EXTERNAL,GSSAPI,LOGIN,PLAIN}.conf

Remember that some of the files contain sensitive information and should
be installed with the proper permissions (0600).
