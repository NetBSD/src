.Sh NAME
.Nm libnetpgpverify
.Nd BIGNUM library of multi-precision integers
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libnetpgpverify
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In netpgp/verify.h
.Ft int
.Fo RSA_public_decrypt
.Fa "int siglen" "const uint8_t *signature" "uint8_t *to" "RSA *rsa" "int padding"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a very small library which isolates out the code
to verify an
.Dv RSA
signature.
It has been kept deliberately small and with few prerequisites to allow
this library to be embedded easily in other applications and libraries.
.Pp
The
.Fo RSA_public_decrypt
function reads the message digest from
.Dv siglen
bytes of the
.Dv signature
using the signer's public key in
.Dv rsa
and places the resulting digest in
.Dv to
which must be long enough to hold the digest.
.Dv padding
was the padding with which the digest was originally calculated.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr bn 3
.Xr libnetpgpbn 3
.Xr libnetpgprsa 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
library first appeared in
.Nx 7.0 .
