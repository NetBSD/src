OpenSSH is a derivative of the original and free ssh 1.2.12 release
by Tatu Ylonen.  Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck, Markus Friedl, Niels
Provos, Theo de Raadt and Dug Song removed many bugs, re-added newer
features and created OpenSSH.  Markus Friedl contributed the support
for SSH protocol versions 1.5 and 2.0.
