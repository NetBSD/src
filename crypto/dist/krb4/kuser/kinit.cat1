NAME
  kinit - Kerberos login utility

SYNOPSIS
  kkiinniitt [ --iirrvvllpp ]

DESCRIPTION
  The _k_i_n_i_t command is used to login to the Kerberos authentication and
  authorization system.  Note that only registered Kerberos users can use the
  Kerberos system.  For information about registering as a Kerberos user, see
  the _k_e_r_b_e_r_o_s_(_1_) manual page.

  If you are using a replaced _l_o_g_i_n that already fetches tickets for you, you
  do not have to use _k_i_n_i_t_.  You will need to use _k_i_n_i_t only in those situa-
  tions in which your original tickets have expired.  (Tickets expire in
  about a day.)  Note as well that the modified _l_o_g_i_n will automatically
  destroy your tickets when you logout from the workstation.

  When you use _k_i_n_i_t without options, the utility prompts for your username
  and Kerberos password, and tries to authenticate your login with the local
  Kerberos server.

  If Kerberos authenticates the login attempt, _k_i_n_i_t retrieves your initial
  ticket and puts it in the ticket file specified by your KRBTKFILE environ-
  ment variable.  If this variable is undefined, your ticket will be stored
  in the _/_t_m_p directory, in the file _t_k_t_u_i_d _, where _u_i_d specifies your user
  identification number.

  If you have logged in to Kerberos without the benefit of the modified _l_o_g_i_n
  program, make sure you use the _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y command to destroy any active tick-
  ets before you end your login session.  You may want to put the _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y
  command in your _._l_o_g_o_u_t file so that your tickets will be destroyed auto-
  matically when you logout.

  The options to _k_i_n_i_t are as follows:

  --ii     _k_i_n_i_t prompts you for a Kerberos instance.

  --rr     _k_i_n_i_t prompts you for a Kerberos realm.  This option lets you
         authenticate yourself with a remote Kerberos server.

  --vv     Verbose mode.  _k_i_n_i_t prints the name of the ticket file used, and a
         status message indicating the success or failure of your login
         attempt.

  --ll     _k_i_n_i_t prompts you for a ticket lifetime in minutes.  Due to protocol
         restrictions in Kerberos Version 4, this value must be between 5 and
         1275 minutes.

  --pp     _k_i_n_i_t will acquire a ticket for changepw.kerberos.
