.Sh NAME
.Nm racoon.conf
.Nd configuration file for racoon
.\"
.\" .Sh SYNOPSIS
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the configuration file for the
.Xr racoon 8
ISAKMP daemon.
.Xr racoon 8
negotiates security associations for itself (ISAKMP SA, or phase 1 SA)
and for kernel IPsec (IPsec SA, or phase 2 SA).
The file consists of a sequence of directives and statements.
Each directive is composed by a tag and statements, enclosed by
.Ql {
and
.Ql } .
Lines beginning with
.Ql #
are comments.
.\"
.Ss Meta Syntax
Keywords and special characters that the parser expects exactly are
displayed using
.Ic this
font.
Parameters are specified with
.Ar this
font.
Square brackets
.Po
.Ql \&[
and
.Ql \&]
.Pc
are used to show optional keywords and parameters.
Note that
you have to pay attention when this manual is describing
.Ar port
numbers.
The
.Ar port
number is always enclosed by
.Ql \&[
and
.Ql \&] .
In this case, the port number is not an optional keyword.
If it is possible to omit the
.Ar port
number,
the expression becomes
.Bq Bq Ar port .
The vertical bar
.Pq Ql \&|
is used to indicate
a choice between optional parameters.
Parentheses
.Po
.Ql \&(
and
.Ql \&)
.Pc
are used to group keywords and parameters when necessary.
Major parameters are listed below.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width addressx -compact
.It Ar number
means a hexadecimal or a decimal number.
The former must be prefixed with
.Ql Li 0x .
.It Ar string
.It Ar path
.It Ar file
means any string enclosed in
.Ql \&"
.Pq double quotes .
.It Ar address
means IPv6 and/or IPv4 address.
.It Ar port
means a TCP/UDP port number.
The port number is always enclosed by
.Ql \&[
and
.Ql \&] .
.It Ar timeunit
is one of following:
.Ic sec , secs , second , seconds ,
.Ic min , mins , minute , minutes ,
.Ic hour , hours .
.El
.\"
.Ss Privilege separation
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic privsep { Ar statements Ic }
Specifies privilege separation parameters.
When enabled, these enable
.Xr racoon 8
to operate with an unprivileged instance doing most of the work, while
a privileged instance takes care of performing the following operations
as root: reading PSK and private keys, launching hook scripts, and
validating passwords against system databases or against PAM.
Please note that using privilege separation makes changes to the
.Ar listen
and
.Ar paths
sections ignored upon configuration reloads.
A
.Xr racoon 8
restart is required if you want such changes to be taken into account.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic user Ar user ;
The user to which the unprivileged instance of
.Xr racoon 8 ,
should switch.
This can be a quoted user name or a numeric UID.
.It Ic group Ar group ;
The group the unprivilegied instance of
.Xr racoon 8 ,
should switch.
This can be a quoted group name or a numeric GID.
.It Ic chroot Ar path ;
A directory to which the unprivileged instance of
.Xr racoon 8
should
.Xr chroot 2 .
This directory should hold a tree where the following files must be
reachable:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Pa /dev/random
.It Pa /dev/urandom
.It The certificates
.It The file containing the Xauth banner
.El
.Pp
The PSK file, the private keys, and the hook scripts are accessed through the
privileged instance of
.Xr racoon 8
and do not need to be reachable in the
.Xr chroot 2 Ap ed
tree.
.El
.El
.Ss Path Specification
This section specifies various paths used by racoon.
When running in privilege separation mode,
.Ic certificate
and
.Ic script
paths are mandatory. A
.Xr racoon 8
restart is required if you want path changes to be taken into account.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic path include Ar path ;
Specifies a path to include a file.
See
.Sx File Inclusion .
.It Ic path pre_shared_key Ar file ;
Specifies a file containing pre-shared key(s) for various ID(s).
See
.Sx Pre-shared key File .
.It Ic path certificate Ar path ;
.Xr racoon 8
will search this directory if a certificate or certificate request is received.
If you run with privilege separation,
.Xr racoon 8
will refuse to use a certificate stored outside of this directory.
.It Ic path backupsa Ar file ;
Specifies a file to which SA information negotiated by
racoon should be stored.
.Xr racoon 8
will install SA(s) from the file when started with the
.Fl B
flag.
The file is growing because
.Xr racoon 8
simply adds SAs to it.
You should maintain the file manually.
.It Ic path script Ar path ;
.Xr racoon 8
will search this directory for scripts hooks.
If you run with privilege separation,
.Xr racoon 8
will refuse to execute a script stored outside of this directory.
.It Ic path pidfile Ar file ;
Specifies file where to store PID of process.
If path starts with
.Pa /
it is treated as an absolute path. Otherwise, it is treated as a relative 
path to the VARRUN directory specified at compilation time.
Default is
.Pa racoon.pid .
.El
.\"
.Ss File Inclusion
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic include Ar file
Specifies other configuration files to be included.
.El
.\"
.Ss Identifier Specification

It must be defined at each
.Ic remote
directive.
.\"
.Ss Timer Specification
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic timer { Ar statements Ic }
This section specifies various timer values used by racoon.
.Pp

The default time is 10 seconds.
.It Ic natt_keepalive Ar number Ar timeunit ;
The interval between sending NAT-Traversal keep-alive packets.
The default time is 20 seconds.
Set to 0s to disable keep-alive packets.
.El
.El
.\"
.Ss Listening Port Specification
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic listen { Ar statements Ic }
If no
.Ar listen
directive is specified,
.Xr racoon 8
will listen on all available interface addresses.
The following is the list of valid statements:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.\" How do I express bold brackets; `[' and `]' .
.\" Answer: For bold brackets, do "Ic \&[ foo \&]".
.\" Is the "Bq Ic [ Ar port ] ;" buggy ?
.It Ic isakmp Ar address Bq Bq Ar port ;
If this is specified,
.Xr racoon 8
will only listen on the defined
.Ar address .
The default port is 500, which is specified by IANA.
You can provide more than one address definition.
.It Ic isakmp_natt Ar address Bq Ar port ;
Same as
.Ic isakmp
but also sets the socket options to accept UDP-encapsulated ESP traffic for
NAT-Traversal.
If you plan to use NAT-T, you should provide at least one address
with port 4500, which is specified by IANA.
There is no default.
.It Ic strict_address ;
Requires that all addresses for ISAKMP be bound.
This statement will be ignored if you do not specify address definitions.
.El
When running in privilege separation mode, you need to restart
.Xr racoon 8
to have changes to the
.Ar listen
section taken into account.
.Pp
The
.Ar listen
section can also be used to specify the admin socket mode and ownership
if racoon was built with support for admin port.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic adminsock Ar path Op Ar owner\ group\ mode ;
The
.Ar path ,
.Ar owner ,
and
.Ar group
values specify the socket path, owner, and group. They must be quoted.
The defaults are
.Pa /var/racoon/racoon.sock ,
UID 0, and GID 0.
.Ar mode
is the access mode in octal. The default is 0600.
.It Ic adminsock disabled ;
This directive tells racoon to not listen on the admin socket.
.El
.El
.\"
.Ss Miscellaneous Global Parameters
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic gss_id_enc Ar enctype ;
Older versions of
.Xr racoon 8
used ISO-Latin-1 as the encoding of the GSS-API identifier attribute.
For interoperability with Microsoft Windows' GSS-API authentication
scheme, the default encoding has been changed to UTF-16LE.
The
.Ic gss_id_enc
parameter allows
.Xr racoon 8
to be configured to use the old encoding for compatibility with existing
.Xr racoon 8
installations.
The following are valid values for
.Ar enctype :
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic utf-16le
Use UTF-16LE to encode the GSS-API identifier attribute.
This is the default encoding.
This encoding is compatible with Microsoft Windows.
.It Ic latin1
Use ISO-Latin-1 to encode the GSS-API identifier attribute.
This is the encoding used by older versions of
.Xr racoon 8 .
.El
.El
.\"
.Ss Remote Nodes Specifications
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic remote ( Ar address | Ic anonymous )
.Bq Bq Ar port
.Bq Ic inherit Ar parent
.Ic { Ar statements Ic }
.Xc
Specifies the IKE phase 1 parameters for each remote node.
The default port is 500.
If
.Ic anonymous
is specified, the statements will apply to any peer that does not match a
more specific
.Ic remote
directive.
.Pp
Sections with
.Ic inherit Ar parent
statements (where
.Ar parent
is either
.Ar address
or a keyword
.Ic anonymous )
that have all values predefined to those of a given
.Ar parent .
In these sections it is enough to redefine only the changed parameters.
.Pp
The following are valid statements.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.\"
.It Ic exchange_mode ( main | aggressive | base ) ;
Defines the exchange mode for phase 1 when racoon is the initiator.
It also means the acceptable exchange mode when racoon is the responder.
More than one mode can be specified by separating them with a comma.
All of the modes are acceptable.
The first exchange mode is what racoon uses when it is the initiator.
.\"
.It Ic doi Ic ipsec_doi ;
Means to use IPsec DOI as specified in RFC 2407.
You can omit this statement.
.\"
.It Ic situation Ic identity_only ;
Means to use SIT_IDENTITY_ONLY as specified in RFC 2407.
You can omit this statement.
.\"
.It Ic identifier Ar idtype ;
This statment is obsolete. Instead, use
.Ic my_identifier .
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic my_identifier Bq Ar qualifier
.Ar idtype ... ;
.Xc
Specifies the identifier sent to the remote host
and the type to use in the phase 1 negotiation.
.Ic address, fqdn , user_fqdn , keyid ,
and
.Ic asn1dn
can be used as an
.Ar idtype .
The
.Ar qualifier
is currently only used for
.Ic keyid ,
and can be either
.Ic file
or
.Ic tag .
The possible values are :
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic my_identifier Ic address Bq Ar address ;
The type is the IP address.
This is the default type if you do not specify an identifier to use.
.It Ic my_identifier Ic user_fqdn Ar string ;
The type is a USER_FQDN (user fully-qualified domain name).
.It Ic my_identifier Ic fqdn Ar string ;
The type is a FQDN (fully-qualified domain name).
.It Xo
.Ic my_identifier Ic keyid Bq Ic file
.Ar file ;
.Xc
The type is a KEY_ID, read from the file.
.It Ic my_identifier Ic keyid Ic tag Ar string ;
The type is a KEY_ID, specified in the quoted string.
.It Ic my_identifier Ic asn1dn Bq Ar string ;
The type is an ASN.1 distinguished name.
If
.Ar string
is omitted,
.Xr racoon 8
will get the DN from the Subject field in the certificate.
.El
.\"
.It Ic xauth_login Bq Ar string ;
Specifies the login to use in client-side Hybrid authentication.
It is available only if
.Xr racoon 8
has been built with this option.
The associated password is looked up in the pre-shared key files,
using the login
.Ic string
as the key id.
.\"
.It Ic peers_identifier Ar idtype ... ;
Specifies the peer's identifier to be received.
If it is not defined then
.Xr racoon 8
will not verify the peer's identifier in ID payload transmitted from the peer.
If it is defined, the behavior of the verification depends on the flag of
.Ic verify_identifier .
The usage of
.Ar idtype
is the same as
.Ic my_identifier
except that the individual component values of an
.Ic asn1dn
identifier may specified as
.Ic *
to match any value (e.g. "C=XX, O=MyOrg, OU=*, CN=Mine").
Alternative acceptable peer identifiers may be specified by repeating the
.Ic peers_identifier
statement.
.\"
.It Ic verify_identifier (on | off) ;
If you want to verify the peer's identifier,
set this to on.
In this case, if the value defined by
.Ic peers_identifier
is not the same as the peer's identifier in the ID payload,
the negotiation will fail.
The default is off.
.\"
.It Ic certificate_type Ar certspec ;
Specifies a certificate specification.
.Ar certspec
is one of followings:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic x509 Ar certfile Ar privkeyfile ;
.Ar certfile
means a file name of a certificate.
.Ar privkeyfile
means a file name of a secret key.
.El
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic plain_rsa Ar privkeyfile ;
.Ar privkeyfile
means a file name of a private key generated by
.Xr plainrsa-gen 8 .
Required
for RSA authentication.
.El
.It Ic ca_type Ar cacertspec ;
Specifies a root certificate authority specification.
.Ar cacertspec
is one of followings:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic x509 Ar cacertfile ;
.Ar cacertfile
means a file name of the root certificate authority.
Default is
.Pa /etc/openssl/cert.pem
.El
.\"
.It Ic mode_cfg (on | off) ;
Gather network information through ISAKMP mode configuration.
Default is off.
.\"
.It Ic weak_phase1_check (on | off) ;
Tells racoon to act on unencrypted deletion messages during phase 1.
This is a small security risk, so the default is off, meaning that
racoon will keep on trying to establish a connection even if the
user credentials are wrong, for instance.
.\"
.It Ic peers_certfile ( dnssec | Ar certfile | Ic plain_rsa Ar pubkeyfile ) ;
If
.Ic dnssec
is defined,
.Xr racoon 8
will ignore the CERT payload from the peer,
and try to get the peer's certificate from DNS instead.
If
.Ar certfile
is defined,
.Xr racoon 8
will ignore the CERT payload from the peer,
and will use this certificate as the peer's certificate.
If
.Ic plain_rsa
is defined,
.Xr racoon 8
will expect
.Ar pubkeyfile
to be the peer's public key that was generated by
.Xr plainrsa-gen 8 .
.\"
.It Ic script Ar script Ic phase1_up
.It Ic script Ar script Ic phase1_down
Shell scripts that get executed when a phase 1 SA goes up or down.
Both scripts get either
.Ic phase1_up
or
.Ic phase1_down
as first argument, and the following
variables are set in their environment:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ev LOCAL_ADDR
The local address of the phase 1 SA.
.It Ev LOCAL_PORT
The local port used for IKE for the phase 1 SA.
.It Ev REMOTE_ADDR
The remote address of the phase 1 SA.
.It Ev REMOTE_PORT
The remote port used for IKE for the phase 1 SA.
.El
The following variables are only set if
.Ic mode_cfg
was enabled:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It INTERNAL_ADDR4
An IPv4 internal address obtained by ISAKMP mode config.
.It INTERNAL_NETMASK4
An IPv4 internal netmask obtained by ISAKMP mode config.
.It INTERNAL_CIDR4
An IPv4 internal netmask obtained by ISAKMP mode config, in CIDR notation.
.It INTERNAL_DNS4
The first internal DNS server IPv4 address obtained by ISAKMP mode config.
.It INTERNAL_DNS4_LIST
A list of internal DNS servers IPv4 address obtained by ISAKMP mode config,
separated by spaces.
.It INTERNAL_WINS4
The first internal WINS server IPv4 address obtained by ISAKMP mode config.
.It INTERNAL_WINS4_LIST
A list of internal WINS servers IPv4 address obtained by ISAKMP mode config,
separated by spaces.
.It SPLIT_INCLUDE
The space separated list of IPv4 addresses and masks (address slash mask)
that define the networks to be encrypted (as opposed to the default where
all the traffic should be encrypted) ; obtained by ISAKMP mode config ;
SPLIT_INCLUDE and SPLIT_LOCAL are mutually exclusive.
.It SPLIT_LOCAL
The space separated list of IPv4 addresses and masks (address slash mask)
that define the networks to be considered local, and thus excluded from the
tunnels ; obtained by ISAKMP mode config.
.It DEFAULT_DOMAIN
The DNS default domain name obtained by ISAKMP mode config.
.El
.\"
.\"
.It Ic send_cert (on | off) ;
If you do not want to send a certificate, set this to off.
The default is on.
.\"
.It Ic send_cr (on | off) ;
If you do not want to send a certificate request, set this to off.
The default is on.
.\"
.It Ic verify_cert (on | off) ;
By default, the identifier sent by the remote host (as specified in its
.Ic my_identifier
statement) is compared with the credentials in the certificate
used to authenticate the remote host as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Type Ic asn1dn:
The entire certificate subject name is compared with the identifier,
e.g. "C=XX, O=YY, ...".
.It Type Ic address, fqdn, or user_fqdn:
The certificate's subjectAltName is compared with the identifier.
.El
If the two do not match the negotiation will fail.
If you do not want to verify the identifier using the peer's certificate,
set this to off.
.\"
.It Ic lifetime time Ar number Ar timeunit ;
Define a lifetime of a certain time
which will be proposed in the phase 1 negotiations.
Any proposal will be accepted, and the attribute(s) will not be proposed to
the peer if you do not specify it (them).
They can be individually specified in each proposal.
.\"
.It Ic ike_frag (on | off | force) ;
Enable receiver-side IKE fragmentation if
.Xr racoon 8
has been built with this feature.
If set to on, racoon will advertise
itself as being capable of receiving packets split by IKE fragmentation.
This extension is there to work around broken firewalls that do not
work with fragmented UDP packets.
IKE fragmentation is always enabled on the sender-side, and it is
used if the peer advertises itself as IKE fragmentation capable.
By selecting force, IKE Fragmentation will
be used when racoon is acting as the initiator even before the remote
peer has advertised itself as IKE fragmentation capable.
.\"
.It Ic esp_frag Ar fraglen ;
This option is only relevant if you use NAT traversal in tunnel mode.
Its purpose is to work around broken DSL routers that reject UDP
fragments, by fragmenting the IP packets before ESP encapsulation.
The result is ESP over UDP of fragmented packets instead of fragmented
ESP over UDP packets (i.e., IP:UDP:ESP:frag(IP) instead of
frag(IP:UDP:ESP:IP)).
.Ar fraglen
is the maximum size of the fragments.
552 should work anywhere,
but the higher
.Ar fraglen
is, the better the performance.
.Pp
Note that because PMTU discovery is broken on many sites, you will
have to use MSS clamping if you want TCP to work correctly.
.\"
.It Ic initial_contact (on | off) ;
Enable this to send an INITIAL-CONTACT message.
The default value is
.Ic on .
This message is useful only when the responder implementation chooses an
old SA when there are multiple SAs with different established time and the
initiator reboots.
If racoon did not send the message,
the responder would use an old SA even when a new SA was established.
For systems that use a KAME derived IPSEC stack, the
.Xr sysctl 8
variable net.key.preferred_oldsa can be used to control this preference.
When the value is zero, the stack always uses a new SA.
.\"
.It Ic passive (on | off) ;
If you do not want to initiate the negotiation, set this to on.
The default value is
.Ic off .
It is useful for a server.
.\"
.It Ic proposal_check Ar level ;
Specifies the action of lifetime length, key length, and PFS of the phase 2
selection on the responder side, and the action of lifetime check in
phase 1.
The default level is
.Ic strict .
If the
.Ar level
is:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic obey
The responder will obey the initiator anytime.
.It Ic strict
If the responder's lifetime length is longer than the initiator's or
the responder's key length is shorter than the initiator's,
the responder will use the initiator's value.
Otherwise, the proposal will be rejected.
If PFS is not required by the responder, the responder will obey the proposal.
If PFS is required by both sides and the responder's group is not equal to
the initiator's, then the responder will reject the proposal.
.It Ic claim
If the responder's lifetime length is longer than the initiator's or
the responder's key length is shorter than the initiator's,
the responder will use the initiator's value.
If the responder's lifetime length is shorter than the initiator's,
the responder uses its own length AND sends a RESPONDER-LIFETIME notify
message to an initiator in the case of lifetime (phase 2 only).
For PFS, this directive behaves the same as
.Ic strict .
.It Ic exact
If the initiator's lifetime or key length is not equal to the responder's,
the responder will reject the proposal.
If PFS is required by both sides and the responder's group is not equal to
the initiator's, then the responder will reject the proposal.
.El
.\"
.It Ic support_proxy (on | off) ;
If this value is set to on, then both values of ID payloads in the
phase 2 exchange are always used as the addresses of end-point of
IPsec-SAs.
The default is off.
.\"
.It Ic generate_policy (on | off | require | unique) ;
This directive is for the responder.
Therefore you should set
.Ic passive
to on in order that
.Xr racoon 8
only becomes a responder.
If the responder does not have any policy in SPD during phase 2
negotiation, and the directive is set to on, then
.Xr racoon 8
will choose the first proposal in the
SA payload from the initiator, and generate policy entries from the proposal.
It is useful to negotiate with clients whose IP address is allocated
dynamically.
Note that an inappropriate policy might be installed into the responder's SPD
by the initiator,
so other communications might fail if such policies are installed
due to a policy mismatch between the initiator and the responder.
.Ic on
and
.Ic require
values mean the same thing (generate a require policy).
.Ic unique
tells racoon to set up unique policies, with a monotoning increasing
reqid number (between 1 and IPSEC_MANUAL_REQID_MAX).
This directive is ignored in the initiator case.
The default value is
.Ic off .
.\"
.\"
.It Ic nat_traversal (on | off | force) ;
This directive enables use of the NAT-Traversal IPsec extension
(NAT-T).
NAT-T allows one or both peers to reside behind a NAT gateway (i.e.,
doing address- or port-translation).
If a NAT gateway is detected during the phase 1 handshake, racoon will
attempt to negotiate the use of NAT-T with the remote peer.
If the negotiation succeeds, all ESP and AH packets for the given connection
will be encapsulated into UDP datagrams (port 4500, by default).
Possible values are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic on
NAT-T is used when a NAT gateway is detected between the peers.
.It Ic off
NAT-T is not proposed/accepted.
This is the default.
.It Ic force
NAT-T is used regardless of whether a NAT gateway is detected between the
peers or not.
.El
Please note that NAT-T support is a compile-time option.
Although it is enabled in the source distribution by default, it
may not be available in your particular build.
In that case you will get a
warning when using any NAT-T related config options.
.\"
.It Ic dpd_delay Ar delay ;
This option activates the DPD and sets the time (in seconds) allowed
between 2 proof of liveliness requests.
The default value is
.Ic 0 ,
which disables DPD monitoring, but still negotiates DPD support.
.\"
.It Ic dpd_retry Ar delay ;
If
.Ic dpd_delay
is set, this sets the delay (in seconds) to wait for a proof of
liveliness before considering it as failed and send another request.
The default value is
.Ic 5 .
.\"
.It Ic dpd_maxfail Ar number ;
If
.Ic dpd_delay
is set, this sets the maximum number of liveliness proofs to request
(without reply) before considering the peer is dead.
The default value is
.Ic 5 .
.\"
.It Ic nonce_size Ar number ;
define the byte size of nonce value.
Racoon can send any value although
RFC2409 specifies that the value MUST be between 8 and 256 bytes.
The default size is 16 bytes.
.\"
.It Ic ph1id Ar number ;
An optionnal number to identify the remote proposal and to link it
only with sainfos who have the same number.
Defaults to 0.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic proposal { Ar sub-substatements Ic }
.Xc
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.\"
.It Ic encryption_algorithm Ar algorithm ;
Specifies the encryption algorithm used for the phase 1 negotiation.
This directive must be defined.
.Ar algorithm
is one of following:

.Ic sainfo ( Ar source_id destination_id | Ar source_id Ic anonymous | Ic anonymous Ar destination_id | Ic anonymous ) [ from Ar idtype [ Ar string ] ] [ Ic group Ar string ]
.Ic { Ar statements Ic }
.Xc
defines the parameters of the IKE phase 2 (IPsec-SA establishment).
.Ar source_id
and
.Ar destination_id
are constructed like:
.Pp
.Ic address Ar address
.Bq Ic / Ar prefix
.Bq Ic [ Ar port ]
.Ar ul_proto
.Pp
or
.Pp
.Ic subnet Ar address
.Bq Ic / Ar prefix
.Bq Ic [ Ar port ]
.Ar ul_proto
.Pp
or
.Pp
.Ar idtype Ar string
.Pp
An id string should be expressed to match the exact value of an ID payload
(source is the local end, destination is the remote end).
This is not like a filter rule.
For example, if you define 3ffe:501:4819::/48 as
.Ar source_id .
3ffe:501:4819:1000:/64 will not match.
.Pp
In the case of a longest prefix (selecting a single host),
.Ar address
instructs to send ID type of ADDRESS while
.Ar subnet
instructs to send ID type of SUBNET.
Otherwise, these instructions are identical.
.Pp
The group keyword allows an XAuth group membership check to be performed
for this sainfo section.
When the mode_cfg auth source is set to
.Ic system
or
.Ic ldap ,
the XAuth user is verified to be a member of the specified group
before allowing a matching SA to be negotiated.

.Xr racoon 8
does not have a list of security protocols to be negotiated.
The list of security protocols are passed by SPD in the kernel.
Therefore you have to define all of the potential algorithms
in the phase 2 proposals even if there are algorithms which will not be used.
These algorithms are define by using the following three directives,
with a single comma as the separator.
For algorithms that can take variable-length keys, algorithm names
can be followed by a key length, like
.Dq Li blowfish 448 .
.Xr racoon 8
will compute the actual phase 2 proposals by computing
the permutation of the specified algorithms,
and then combining them with the security protocol specified by the SPD.
For example, if
.Ic des , 3des , hmac_md5 ,
and
.Ic hmac_sha1
are specified as algorithms, we have four combinations for use with ESP,
and two for AH.
Then, based on the SPD settings,
.Xr racoon 8
will construct the actual proposals.
If the SPD entry asks for ESP only, there will be 4 proposals.
If it asks for both AH and ESP, there will be 8 proposals.
Note that the kernel may not support the algorithm you have specified.
