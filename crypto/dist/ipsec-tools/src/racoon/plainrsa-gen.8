.Sh NAME
.Nm plainrsa-gen
.Nd generator for Plain RSA keys
.\"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm plainrsa-gen
.Bk -words
.Op Fl b Ar bits

.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
can be used to generate
.Li Plain RSA keys
for authentication purposes.
Using
.Li Plain RSA keys
is optional.
Other possibilities are
.Li Pre-shared keys
or
.Li X.509 certificates .
.\"
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b Ar bits
bit length of the key.
Default is
.Li 1024 ,
recommended length is
.Li 2048
or even
.Li 4096
bits.
Note that generating longer keys takes longer time.
.It Fl e Ar pubexp
value of RSA public exponent.
Default is
.Li 0x3 .
Don't change this unless you really know what you are doing!
.It Fl f Ar outfile
.Ar outfile
instead of
.Li stdout .
If the file already exists it won't be overwritten.
You wouldn't like to lose your private key by accident, would you?
.El
.\"
.Sh OUTPUT FILE FORMAT
This is the secret
.Li private key
that should
.Ic never
leave your computer:
.Bd -literal
: RSA	{
	# RSA 1024 bits
	# pubkey=0sAQOrWlcwbAIdNSMhDt...
	Modulus: 0xab5a57306c021d3523...
	PublicExponent: 0x03
	PrivateExponent: 0x723c3a2048...
	Prime1: 0xd309b30e6adf9d85c01...
	Prime2: 0xcfdc2a8aa5b2b3c90e3...
	Exponent1: 0x8cb122099c9513ae...
	Exponent2: 0x8a92c7071921cd30...
	Coefficient: 0x722751305eafe9...
  }
.Ed
.Pp
The line
.Li pubkey=0sAQOrW...
of the
.Li private key
contains a
.Li public key
that should be stored in the other peer's configuration in this format:
.Bd -literal
: PUB 0sAQOrWlcwbAIdNSMhDt...
.Ed
.\"
.Pp
You can also specify
.Li from
and
.Li to
addresses for which the key is valid:
.Bd -literal
0.0.0.0/0 10.20.30.0/24 : PUB 0sAQOrWlcwbAIdNSMhDt...
