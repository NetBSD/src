.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to control
.Xr racoon 8
operation, if ipsec-tools was configured with adminport support.
Communication between
.Nm
and
.Xr racoon 8
is done through a UNIX socket.
By changing the default mode and ownership
of the socket, you can allow non-root users to alter
.Xr racoon 8
behavior, so do that with caution.
.Pp
The following commands are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It reload-config
This should cause
.Xr racoon 8
to reload its configuration file.
.It show-schedule
Unknown command.
.It show-sa Op isakmp|esp|ah|ipsec
Dump the SA: All the SAs if no SA class is provided, or either ISAKMP SAs,
IPsec ESP SAs, IPsec AH SAs, or all IPsec SAs.
Use
.Fl l
to increase verbosity.
.It flush-sa Op isakmp|esp|ah|ipsec
is used to flush all SAs if no SA class is provided, or a class of SAs,
either ISAKMP SAs, IPsec ESP SAs, IPsec AH SAs, or all IPsec SAs.
.It Xo establish-sa
.Oo Fl u Ar username
.Oc Ar saopts
.Xc
Establish an SA, either an ISAKMP SA, IPsec ESP SA, or IPsec AH SA.
The optional
.Fl u Ar username
can be used when establishing an ISAKMP SA while hybrid auth is in use.
.Nm
will prompt you for the password associated with
.Ar username
and these credentials will be used in the Xauth exchange.
.Pp
.Ar saopts
has the following format:
.Bl -tag -width Bl
.It isakmp {inet|inet6} Ar src Ar dst
.It {esp|ah} {inet|inet6} Ar src/prefixlen/port Ar dst/prefixlen/port
{icmp|tcp|udp|gre|any}
.El
.It Xo vpn-connect
.Oo Fl u Ar username
.Oc Ar vpn_gateway
.Xc
This is a particular case of the previous command.
It will establish an ISAKMP SA with
.Ar vpn_gateway .
.It delete-sa Ar saopts
Delete an SA, either an ISAKMP SA, IPsec ESP SA, or IPsec AH SA.
.It vpn-disconnect Ar vpn_gateway
This is a particular case of the previous command.
It will kill all SAs associated with
.Ar vpn_gateway .
.It show-event Op Fl l
Dump all events reported by
.Xr racoon 8 ,
then quit.
The
.Fl l
flag causes
.Nm
to not stop once all the events have been read, but rather to loop
awaiting and reporting new events.
.It logout-user Ar login
Delete all SA established on behalf of the Xauth user
.Ar login .
