.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to control
.Xr racoon 8
operation, if ipsec-tools was configured with adminport support.
Communication between
.Nm
and
.Xr racoon 8
is done through a UNIX socket.
By changing the default mode and ownership
of the socket, you can allow non-root users to alter
.Xr racoon 8
behavior, so do that with caution.
.Pp
The following general options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Debug mode.
Hexdump sent admin port commands.
.It Fl l
Increase verbosity.
Mainly for show-sa command.
.It Fl s Ar socket
Specify unix socket name used to connecting racoon.
.El

The following commands are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It reload-config
This should cause
.Xr racoon 8
to reload its configuration file.
.It show-schedule
Unknown command.
.It show-sa Op isakmp|esp|ah|ipsec
Dump the SA: All the SAs if no SA class is provided, or either ISAKMP SAs,
IPsec ESP SAs, IPsec AH SAs, or all IPsec SAs.
Use
.Fl l
to increase verbosity.
.It get-sa-cert Oo inet|inet6 Oc Ar src dst
Output the raw certificate that was used to authenticate the phase 1
matching
.Ar src
and
.Ar dst .
.It flush-sa Op isakmp|esp|ah|ipsec
is used to flush all SAs if no SA class is provided, or a class of SAs,
either ISAKMP SAs, IPsec ESP SAs, IPsec AH SAs, or all IPsec SAs.
.It establish-sa Oo Fl w Oc Oo Fl n Ar remoteconf Oc Oo Fl u Ar username \
Oc Ar saopts
Establish an SA, either an ISAKMP SA, IPsec ESP SA, or IPsec AH SA.
The optional
.Fl u Ar username
can be used when establishing an ISAKMP SA while hybrid auth is in use.
The exact remote block to use can be specified with
.Fl n Ar remoteconf .
.Nm
will prompt you for the password associated with
.Ar username
and these credentials will be used in the Xauth exchange.
.Pp
Specifying
.Fl w
will make racoonctl wait until the SA is actually established or
an error occurs.
.Pp
.Ar saopts
has the following format:
.Bl -tag -width Bl
.It isakmp {inet|inet6} Ar src Ar dst
.It {esp|ah} {inet|inet6} Ar src/prefixlen/port Ar dst/prefixlen/port
{icmp|tcp|udp|gre|any}

This is a particular case of the previous command.
It will establish an ISAKMP SA with
