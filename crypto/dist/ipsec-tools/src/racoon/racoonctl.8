.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to control
.Xr racoon 8 
operation, if ipsec-tools was configured with adminport support.
Communication between
.Nm
and 
.Xr racoon 8
is done through a UNIX socket. By changing the default mode and ownership 
of the socket, you can allow non root users to alter 
.Xr racoon 8
behavior, so do that with caution.
.Pp
The following commands are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It reload-config
This should cause 
.Xr racoon 8
to reload its configuration file. This seems completely broken at the time
this man page is written. 
.It show-schedule
Unknown command.
.It show-sa Op isakmp|esp|ah|ipsec
Dump the SA: All the SA if no SA class is provided, or either ISAKMP SA, 
IPsec ESP SA, or IPsec AH SA, or all IPsec SA. 
Use
.Fl l 
to increase verbosity.
.It flush-sa Op isakmp|esp|ah|ipsec
is used to flush all SA if no SA class is provided, or a class of SA, 
either ISAKMP SA, IPsec ESP SA, or IPsec AH SA, or all IPsec SA.
.It establish-sa Oo Fl u Ar username Oc Ar saopts
Establish a SA, either a ISAKMP SA, IPsec ESP SA, or IPsec AH SA. The 
optionnal 
.Fl u Ar username
can be used when establishing an ISAKMP SA while hybrid auth is in use. 
.Nm
will prompt you for the password associated with 
.Ar username
and theses credentials will be used in the Xauth exchange.
.Pp
.Ar saopts 
can have the following formats:
.Bl -tag -width Bl
.It isakmp {inet|inet6} Ar src Ar dst
.It {esp|ah} {inet|inet6} Ar src/prefixlen/port Ar dst/prefixlen/port
{icmp|tcp|udp|any}
.El
.It vpn-connect Oo Fl u Ar username Oc Ar vpn_gateway
This is a particular case of the previous command. It will establish an ISAKMP
SA with
.Ar vpn_gateway .
.It delete-sa Ar saopts
Delete a SA, either a ISAKMP SA, IPsec ESP SA, or IPsec AH SA. 
.It vpn-disconnect Ar vpn_gateway
This is a particular case of the previous command. It will kill all SA
associated with 
.Ar vpn_gateway .
.It show-event Op Fl l
Dump all events reported by 
.Xr racoon 8 ,
then quit.
The
.Fl l
causes
.Nm
to not stop once all the events have been readen, but rather to loop
awaiting and reporting new events.
