IPsec-tools
===========

This package provides a way to use the native IPsec functionality 
in the Linux 2.6+ kernel. It works as well on NetBSD and FreeBSD.

	- libipsec, a PF_KEYv2 library
	- setkey, a tool to directly manipulate policies and SAs
	- racoon, an IKEv1 keying daemon

IPsec-tools were ported to Linux from the KAME project 
(http://www.kame.net) by Derek Atkins <derek@ihtfp.com>.

History
=======

Ipsec-tools was originally developed by the KAME project. It was then moved
on SourfeForge, at the following address:

	http://ipsec-tools.sourceforge.net/

Due to too restricted commit accesses, the development stalled, and the
source code was moved into NetBSD's CVS repository, in:

	src/crypto/dist/ipsec-tools

However, many distributions still take their tarballs from SourceForge, and
each distribution maintains local patches.

FreeBSD maintains its own libipsec and setkey tools, in:

	head/lib/libipsec/
	head/sbin/setkey/

A Trac used to exist, at the following address:

	https://trac.ipsec-tools.net/

but the domain expired and was not renewed.

The mailing lists from SourceForge still exist:

	ipsec-tools-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
	ipsec-tools-users@lists.sourceforge.net
	http://sf.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=ipsec-tools-devel
