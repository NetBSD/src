$KAME: question,v 1.28 2003/05/23 05:13:03 sakane Exp $

This was sent to Kivinen and Paul at 20-Sep-2000.

Q: how may policy matters are.  can we interoperate ?

Q. If there is the phase 1 spi size excepting 16 and 0 in SA payload.
	warn it.  and reject or accept ?

Q. ID payload handling in phase 2 besides IPSECDOI_ID_IP*.
   e.g. IPSECDOI_ID_DER_ASN1_DN.  Well, are these used in phase 2 ?

Q. The padding for data attribute.
	in particular, variable-length attribute like ID-userfqdn.

Q. vendorid's hash algorithm
	For aggressive mode ?.
	In main mode, should I use negotiated algorithm ?
A. it's not needed any negotiation.

Q. If we use different hash algorith to compute the value of the vendor id,
   is it possible to be same result of the hash value ?

Q. encryption during aggressive mode.
	when i receive encrypted packet of 2nd message from responder,
	it can be decoded.  When i am responder, should i send encrypted one ?

Q: phase2 PFS and KE payload
	when the responder was not required PFS, if the initiator send KE ?
	if the responder's pfs group is not match to the initiator's one ?
	If initiator requests PFS, should we accept without acceptable check ?
		reject the proposal and quit the phase 2.
		accept it.
	it's policy issue.

Q. If tye type of ID payload is SUBNET, should it be allowed ::1/128 as host
   address ?
A. yes.  consensus at bake-off.

Q. how many proposal can we send ?
	30? 300? infinite ?

Q. Is there only one payload of RESPONDER-LIFETIME in a IKE message
   even if SA bundle is required ?
   At the moment, racoon sends this notify payload(s) against each protocol.

Q. Which is SPI to be used initiator's or responder's when sending
   RESPONDER-LIFETIME ?
A. At the moment, racoon sends responder's one.

Q. Is it typo in the base mode draft ?
            HDR, SA, Idii, Ni_b     =>
                           Ni ???
                                    <= HDR, SA, Idir, Nr_b
                                                      Nr ???
A. Yes, typo. (network associates said.)

Q. What's proto_id in notify message of the responder 2nd message with commit
   bit processing when multiple different SA applyed ?

Q. Is it forbidden to clear commit bit during phase2 negotiation ?
A. not forbidden,

Q. how many time is the notify message sent in phase 2 ?
A. don't resend notify message because peer can use Acknowledged
   Informational if peer requires the reply of the notify message.
Q. phase 1 is ?

Q. What kind of policy configuration is desired?
   policy.conf makes sense in certain situations only, such as:
   - we are the initiator, and trying to enforce certain configuration.

   If we would like to talk with strangers (like IPsec-ready webserver, or
   "IPsec with everyone" configuration), or need to move from place to place
   (like IPsec-ready nomadic node), we need an ability to write "wildcard
   policy entry" which matches situations/packets/whatever, and then install
   non-wildcard policy entry into the kernel.
   For example:
   - policy.conf says 0.0.0.0/0 -> 0.0.0.0/0, protocol "any", type "use",
     for "encrypt everything" configuration.
   - phase 2 ID payload will be exchanged for real address we have, and the
     peer has (a.b.c.d/32).  This is not the same as "0.0.0.0/0" configured
     onto policy entry.
   - with the current code, policy.conf and phase 2 ID does not match, and
     it will fail.

   If we are acting as responder, we will be making policy entry from phase 2
   IDs.  Is it always okay to accept phase 2 IDs as is, into our kernel policy?
   We'll need to have filtering rule, or mapping rules from phase 2 IDs to
   kernel policy.
   For example:
   - we have 10.1.1.0/24 -> 10.1.2.0/24, protocol "any" in policy.conf.
   - what happens if we get, as responder, 10.1.1.0/25 -> 10.1.2.0/25,
     protocol "any"?  should we accept it as is, or should we respect our
     configuration?
     if we respect our configuration, 10.1.1.128/25 -> 10.1.2.128/25 traffic
     will be encrypted from our side, and end up being dropped by the peer.
   - what happens if we get, as responder, 10.1.1.0/24 -> 10.1.2.0/24,
     protocol "tcp"?  should we accept it as is, or should we respect our
     configuration?
     if we respect our configuration, non-tcp traffic will be dropped on
     the peer.

   -> the question is obsoleted by configuration language change.

Q. What's msgid of informational exchange for error notify message during
   phase2 ?  Is it same as msgid of phase2 negotiation caused error ?
   Or new msgid created ?  If later case, spi must be conveyed.
A. new msgid should be used
Q. how can we deduce phase 2 from the notification?
A. see draft-ietf-ipsec-notifymsg-*.txt

Q. I don't know the situation to initiate acknowledged informational.

Q. How many certificate payload in a packet are sent ?
   isakmp-test.ssh.fi send both CRL and CERT in a packet.
A. multiple CERT payload can be sent.  Or use PKCS#7.

Q. What should we do if nonce size is greater than size of RSA modulus
   in authentication with public key encryption, also size of body of
   ID payload ?

Q. For IKE negotiation of IPComp, how should we encode CPI (2 byte) into SPI
   field of proposal payload (for AH/ESP, normally 4 bytes)?
   Options are as follows:
   (1) put it as 4 byte value, set SPI size to 4
                          1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   (2) put it as 2 byte value, set SPI size to 2.  No padding must be made.
                          1                   2                   3

   IRE did (1), IIRC. (Jan 2000)

   SSH does (2), and rejects (1). (Sep 2000)

   The following email suggests (2) for normal case, and allow (1) for backward
   compatibility (responder case I bet).

A: (2) for normal case, and allow (1) for backward compatibility
   (responder case I bet).  <draft-shacham-ippcp-rfc2393bis-05.txt>

Q. INITIAL-CONTACT message.
   When should we send an INITIAL-CONTACT message?
A. see jenkins rekey draft

   We must ignore unencrypted INITIAL-CONTACT message.

   If we have two nodes and they issue the first packet of phase 1 at the same
   time, both may try to transmit INITIAL-CONTACT message, and effectively
   kills both connection attempt.

	node 1			node 2
	  |			  |
	  |----------\  /---------| phase 1 first packet
	  |	      \/	  |
	  |	      /\	  |
	  |<---------/  \-------->|
	  |			  |
	  |----------\  /---------| INITIAL-CONTACT
	  |	      \/	  |
	  |	      /\	  |
	  |<---------/  \-------->|

   Options are as follows:
   (1) don't throw INITIAL-CONTACT message.
   (2) don't delete old phase 1 information, even if we get INITIAL-CONTACT
       message..
   (3) don't delete phase 1 information, if it is very new.  delete phase 1
       information only if they are old.
   (4) implement tie-breaker rule.  for example, compare IP address and remove
       phase 1 initiated by the one who has larger IP address.

Q: IPv6 neighbor discovery.
	When a security policy is set to "all packet require IPsec", it will
	cover IPv6 ND packets as well.  The node will try to secure ND, and
	we will have chicken-and-egg problem (without ND we cannot send IKE
	packets, without IKE negotiation we cannot send ND).

	What can we do?
	- always bypass IPsec policy lookup if a packet is for ND.
	- Security policy should have more detail rules to filter
	  such packet, like icmp6 type/code filters.

Q: When there are no ID payloads in phase 2 ?
A. guess from the pair of address of IKE peer.

Q: Delete payload.
	Which SPI should I carry on Delete notify ?
	There is no documentation.

	An initiator should send a set of SPI of inbound SAs.
	A responder should delete a set of outbound SAs which are sent by
	an initiator.

	When an IKE node deletes old SAs, should it send DELETE notify to
	a peer ?

	When does a node send DELETE notify ?
		when a IKE node deletes old SAs expilicitly.
		when a SA expires (hard lifetime reached).
			It may not be necessary.

	When a DELETE notify packet is dropped, SA will get inconsistent
	between peers.
		We can prevent from it by using "heartbeat" ?

	when there is no phase 1 SA, should I negotiate phase 1 SA before
	sending delete notify ?
	A: no need.  (the consensus made at the mailing list ?)

Q: "heartbeat"
	It means a signal of "I'm alive".
	It is exchanged in phase 1.5.
	When a responder dies/reboots, phase 2 SA sitll remains but
	we can know the rebooting of the peer by using "heartbeat".

	Is INITIAL-CONTACT message useless if we choise "heartbeat" ?
		We don't know.

Q: responder's action in a normal case.
	A responder should never initiate both phase 1 and phase 2 at anytime.
	Once we have decided which side we are (initiator/responder), the
	relationship will never change.

Q: only the byte type of lifetime on phase 2, not exist the type of time.
	No ducumentation states explicitly.
	We can choose to use default lifetime (28800).
	We can reject it accortding to a policy.

Q: phase 2 lifetime negotiation
	what should I do if the peer has proposed the lifetime value which
	does not match to our policy ?
	- always reject it.
	- use my lifetime, then send RESPONDER LIFETIME.
	- during negotiation obey the initiator.  install SA lifetime based
	  on the lifetime we have decided (not from the negotiation).

Q: phase 1 lifetime negotiation
	can we do like phase 2 ?

Q: Does RFC2407 4.5.4 Lifetime Notification say for phase 2 ? or phase 1 ?
	responder lifetime may be inapproprite for phase1 because
	proposal is not encrypted, so bad guy can forge it.

Q: phase 1 lifetime of bytes.
	What should we count ?
	Or it should be obsoleted ?

Q: phase 2 lifetime of bytes.
	byte lifetime of an SA is harder to implement/manipulate than
	wallclock lifetime, because:
	- if there's packet losses on the link, it will lead to disagreement
	  between peers about how much traffic were gone through the SA.
	- it is unclear when to compute the lifetime.  for example, for IPComp,
	  there's a big difference between computing byte lifetime before
	  compression, or after compression.  [RFC2401 page 23:
	  should compute byte lifetime using a packet BEFORE IPsec processing]

	it is more questionable to use byte lifetime for inbound SA, than
	for outbound SA.  we will have more problem if we expire inbound SA
	earlier than the peer (if we expire an SA earlier than the peer,
	inbound traffic will result in "no SA found" error).

Q: soft and hard lifetime. [RFC2401 page 23]
	RFC2401 talks about soft and hard lifetime.  for stable rekeying
	operation, it may help if we introduce another kind of lifetime;

	soft lifetime (80% of hard lifetime, for example):
		should inform IKE of the expiry, and IKE should try to negotiate
		a new SA.
	deprecation lifetime (90%):
		no outbound packet should be generated by this SA.
		inbound packet is handled okay.
	hard lifetime (100%)
		SA will be erased.

Q: responder should not modify phase 2 attributes
	even for phase 1, we should not modify attributes.
	for lifetime attributes, it is okay to switch between V/B format.

	draft-ietf-ipsec-ike-01.txt Appendix A:
	If this is the case, an
	attribute offered as variable (or basic) by the initiator of this
	protocol MAY be returned to the initiator as a basic (or variable).

Q: check if reserved field is zero, reject if 
	we should do this (sakane)
	i don't think so, it will kill future protocol enhancements (itojun)

Q: order of proposals in IKE phase 2 packet, and IPsec processing order
	how to negotiate SA bundle.
	IKE: esp+ah, or ah+esp
		-> is it safe to consider both as IP|AH|ESP|ULP?
		-> is the proposal prefered to send the order of ah+esp.
	IKE: ah+ah?
		reject? or policy issue.
	RFC2401bis should state the pattern of SA bundle.
	      AH
	      AH+ESP
	      AH    +IPCOMP
	      AH+ESP+IPCOMP
		 ESP
	      AH+ESP
	      AH+ESP+IPCOMP
		 ESP+IPCOMP
	      AH+ESP
	      AH+ESP+IPCOMP
	Also RFC2401bis should state the meaning of protcol mode.

	we are going to install both SAs, ESP and AH.  and they are bundled.
	we should negotiate both SAs in single phase2.

	can we do that separately ?
		it is hard to verify the policy because the policy might be
		defined SA bundle.
	when i make packet IP2|AH|ESP|IP1|ULP.
		proposal and order must be
			ah/transport + esp/tunnel ?
			ah/tunnel + esp/tunnel ?

Q: what should we do if phase 1 SA expires, during phase2 SA negotiation?
A. restart phase 2 negotiation from scratch

Q: what kind of notification message a node should send on decode failure?
	ISAKMP_NTYPE_INVALID_PAYLOAD_TYPE
		iked
	ISAKMP_NTYPE_UNEQUAL_PAYLOAD_LENGTHS
		racoon
	ISAKMP_NTYPE_PAYLOAD_MALFORMED
		sanity check would be hairy

Q: Certificate Request.
	where to attach CR?
		obey draft-ietf-ipsec-pki-req-05.txt.
	what should we put inside CR?
		my own signer?
	RFC2408 page 34 says;

    o  Certificate Authority (variable length) - Contains an encoding of
       an acceptable certificate authority for the type of certificate
       requested.  As an example, for an X.509 certificate this field
       would contain the Distinguished Name encoding of the Issuer Name
       of an X.509 certificate authority acceptable to the sender of
       this payload.  This would be included to assist the responder in
       determining how much of the certificate chain would need to be
       sent in response to this request.  If there is no specific
       certificate authority requested, this field SHOULD not be
       included.

Subject: CERT_REQ_PAYLOAD usage
From: Tero Kivinen <kivinen@ssh.fi>
Date: Tue, 26 Sep 2000 23:47:00 +0300 (EET DST)

	1) If you absolutely need certificates from the other side for
	the authentication to work, you MUST send certificate request
	payload.

	2) If the authentication can succeed without the other end
	sending certificates (you have some certificate for the other
	end, or you can fetch the certificate from the certificate
	repository), you MAY send certificate request.

	3) If you just want any certificate without specifying the CA
	root, send certificate request having empty CA name.

	4) When you receive certificate request you MUST send your own
	certificate for that CA.

	5) If you receive empty certificate request you MUST send the
	certificate you are going use in the authentication. If you
	have multiple certificates for the same private key, you
	SHOULD send all of them.

	6) If you do not receive certificate request, you SHOULD NOT
	send any certificates, unless you have reason to belive that
	the other end has wrong certificate for you (for example you
	have enrolled a new certificate recently).

	7) You MAY include extra certificates, CRLs etc if you have
	them available (I.e include your other certificates also
	(certificate pre-loading), include sub-CA certificates,
	include CRLs etc.

Q: retransmission method (implementation issue)
	how can I realize that the last packet in phase 1 was dropped.
	main/base mode:
		no problem in initiator side.
		responder should wait for the retransmited 5th(3rd) packet
		from initiator.
	aggressive mode:
		responder should wait for the retransmited 2nd packet
		from responder.
	quick mode:
		initiator should wait for the retransmited 2nd packet
		from responder.
		when i am initiator, if we don not use commit bit, i will
		install the SAs after sending last message.

	under the following situation we will see retransmisson of phase 1 3rd
	packet (prior to the last packet) from the peer, even if we already
	have started phase 2 negotiaiton:
	- initiator have transmitted the last (5th) packet of phase 1 exchange.
	  the initiator believes that phase 1 is done.
	- the last (5th) packet in phase 1 exchange was lost
	responder retransmits phase 1 N-1 packet
		main mode
	FW-1 transmits the last packet in phase 1/2 exchange, 3 times.

Q: retransmission timer?
	should we manage it in per-peer basis?
		yup.  we may need to
	RFC2408: change retransmission timer dynamically
		gets harder to debug...

Q: checks against retransmission
	check ISAKPM header only (watanabe)
	check MD5(msg)

Q: Nonce size
	a size of value MUST be 4 - 252 (RFC2409)
	reject if the value is out-of-range

Q: x.509 certificate and ID payload
	if there is the certificate and the type of ID payload is
		not DN, then compare with the subjectAltName in certificate.
		DN, then compare with the subjectName in certificate.
			must take care of the order of OID.

Q: IP address of subjectAltName and of real entity.
	There are two subjectAltName, email and IP address, in the certificate.
	ID payload includes USER-FQDN, and same to email address of
	subjectAltName.
	If IP address of subjectAltName is different from the real entity's
	IP address.  What should we do ?

Q: commit bit
	who will set the commit bit?  when?

	no action.  if the other end sets it to 1, we should do that too
	(sakane)
	responder should set it to 1.  or it may leave it as is (watanabe)

	should revisit rekey draft.

Q: what happens if we have multiple phase 1 SAs for the same src/dst pair?

Q: phase 1 ID payload
	RSA signature and pre-shared key
	same ID value.
	must include the ID into subject alt name.

Q: rekey.
	- common: IPsec layer always use oldest SA.  optionally, send a delete
		payload for old SA when we got a new SA.
	- freeswan: trust no informational exchange (including initial-contact).
		assume everyone will be using the latest SA in IPsec layer.
		assume that phase 2 responder will install new key when the
		responder got 1st packet of phase 2 (not the 3rd packet).

Q: for responder side, is it allowed to reorder proposals?  for example,
is it allowed to reply to the following proposal:
with this:

Q: IPComp SA with wellknown CPI in CPI field.  how to handle it?
  with the current code, wellknown CPI will be installed as is, because:
  - racoon can negotiate an IPComp SA with wellknown CPI, and installs it as is
  - the kernel have no check about it
  however, by doing so we will have CPI (SPI) conflict on rekey, or with
  multiple peers.

  there could be couple of stragegies from implementation point of view
  (workaround):
  (1) do not install IPComp SA if we negotiated it with wellknown CPI.
      this will introduce another trouble: no trigger for rekey, due to
      no lifetime management on the IPComp SA.
  (2) install IPComp SA with fabricated (local) CPI, with RAWCPI option flag
      raised.  confusing...
  (3) use topmost 16 bits to turn wellknown CPI into unique numbers.
      how to assign numbers?
  the problem is not unique to racoon, it is a generic problem.
  protocol-wise, we could have couple of fixes:
  (1) never negotiate an IPComp SA with a wellknown CPI.
  (2) disambiguate IPComp SA by using other attributes, like lifetime,
      installation timestamp or whatever.
  (3) always IPComp as a addendum to ESP/AH.  do not treat it as an independent
      SA.
  I'm in favor of (1).
