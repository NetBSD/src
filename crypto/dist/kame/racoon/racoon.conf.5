.\"
.\" .Sh SYNOPSIS
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the configuration file for the
.Xr racoon 8
ISAKMP daemon.
.Xr racoon 8
negotiates security associations for itself (ISAKMP SA)
and for kernel IPsec (IPsec SA).
The file consists of a sequence of directives and statements.
Each directive is composed by a tag, and statements are enclosed by
.Ql {
and
.Ql } .
Lines beginning with
.Ql #
are comments.
.\"
.Ss Meta Syntax
Keywords and special characters that the parser expects exactly are
displayed using
.Ic this
font.
Parameters are specified with
.Ar this
font.
Square brackets
.Po
.Ql \*(lB
and
.Ql \*(rB
.Pc
are used to show optional keywords and parameters.

you have to pay attention when this manual is describing
.Ar port
numbers.
The
.Ar port
number is always enclosed by
.Ql \*(lB
and
.Ql \*(rB .
In this case, the port number is not an optional keyword.
If it is possible to omit
.Ar port
number,
the expression becomes
.Bq Ic Bq Ar port .
The vertical bar
.Pq Ql \*(Ba
is used to indicate
a choice between optional parameters.
Parentheses

.El 
.\"
.It Ic peers_identifier Ar idtype ... ;
specifies the peer's identifier as it is specified with
.Ic my_identifier .
If it is not defined then
.Xr racoon 8
will not verify the peer's identifier in ID payload transmitted from the peer.
.Xr racoon 8
will just warn it at the moment even if you defined it.
.\"
.It Ic certificate_type Ar certspec ;

.Ar privkeyfile
means a file name of secret key.
.El
.\"
.It Ic peers_certfile ( dnssec \*(Ba Ar certfile ) ;
If
.Ic dnssec
is defined,
.Xr racoon 8
will ignore the CERT payload from the peer,
and try to get the peer's certificate from DNS instead.
If
.Ar certfile
is defined,
.Xr racoon 8
will ignore the CERT payload from the peer,
and will use this certificate as the peer's certificate.
.\"
.It Ic send_cert (on \(ba off) ;
If you do not want to send a certificate for some reason, set this to off.
The default is on.
.\"
.It Ic send_cr (on \(ba off) ;

The default is on.
.\"
.It Ic verify_cert (on \(ba off) ;
If you do not want to verify the remote peer's certificate for some reason,
set this to off.
The default is on.
.\"
.It Ic lifetime time Ar number Ar timeunit ;
.It Ic lifetime byte Ar number Ar byteunit ;
define a lifetime of a certain time or certain number of bytes
which will be proposed in the phase 1 negotiations.
Any proposal will be accepted, and the attribute(s) will be not proposed to
the peer if you do not specify it(them).
They can be individually specified in each proposal.
Note that the lifetime of bytes is unused right now.
.\"
.It Ic initial_contact (on \(ba off) ;
enable this to send an INITIAL-CONTACT message.
The default value is
.Ic on .
.\"
.It Ic passive (on \(ba off) ;
If you do not want to initiate the negotiation, set this to on.
The default value is
.Ic off .
It is useful for a server.
.\"
.It Ic proposal_check Ar level ;
specifies the action of lifetime length and PFS of the phase 2
selection on the responder side.
The default level is
.Ic strict .
If the
.Ar level
is;
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic obey
the responder will obey the initiator anytime.
.It Ic strict
If the responder's length is longer than the initiator's one, the
responder uses the initiator's one.
Otherwise it rejects the proposal.
If PFS is not required by the responder, the responder will obey the proposal.
If PFS is required by both sides and if the responder's group is not equal to
the initiator's one, then the responder will reject the proposal.
.It Ic claim
If the responder's length is longer than the initiator's one, the
responder will use the initiator's one.
If the responder's length is
shorter than the initiator's one, the responder uses its own length
AND sends a RESPONDER-LIFETIME notify message to an initiator in the
case of lifetime.
About PFS, this directive is same as
.Ic strict .
.It Ic exact
If the initiator's length is not equal to the responder's one, the
responder will reject the proposal.
If PFS is required by both sides and if the responder's group is not equal to
the initiator's one, then the responder will reject the proposal.
.El
.\"
.It Ic support_mip6 (on \(ba off) ;
If this value is set on then both values of ID payloads in phase 2 exchange
are always used as the addresses of end-point of IPsec-SAs.
The default is off.
.\"
.It Ic generate_policy (on \(ba off) ;
This directive is for the responder.
Therefore you should set
.Ic passive
on in order that
.Xr racoon 8
only becomes a responder.
If the responder does not have any policy in SPD during phase 2 negotiation,
and the directive is set on, then
.Xr racoon 8
will choice the first proposal in the
SA payload from the initiator, and generate policy entries from the proposal.
It is useful to negotiate with the client which is allocated IP address
dynamically and the communication needs IPSec tunnel mode.
This directive is ignored in the initiator case.
The default value is
.Ic off .
.\"
.It Ic nonce_size Ar number ;
define the byte size of nonce value.
Racoon can send any value although
RFC2409 specifies that the value MUST be between 8 and 256 bytes.
The default size is 16 bytes.

.\".Ic rc5 , idea
for oakley.
For other transforms, this statement should not be used.
.\"
.It Ic hash_algorithm Ar algorithm;
define the hash algorithm used for the phase 1 negotiation.
This directive must be defined.
.Ar algorithm
is one of following:
.Ic md5, sha1
for oakley.

define the group used for the Diffie-Hellman exponentiations.
This directive must be defined.
.Ar group
is one of following:
.Ic modp768 , modp1024 , modp1536 .
Or you can define 1, 2, or 5 as the DH group number.
When you want to use aggressive mode,
you must define same DH group in each proposal.
.It Ic lifetime time Ar number Ar timeunit ;
.It Ic lifetime byte Ar number Ar byteunit ;
define lifetime of the phase 1 SA proposal.
Refer to the description of
.Ic lifetime
directive immediately defined in
.Ic remote
directive.
.It Ic gssapi_id Ar string ;
define the GSS-API endpoint name, to be included as an attribute in the SA,
if the
.Ic gssapi_krb
authentication method is used. If this is not defined, the default value of
.Ql ike/hostname
is used, where hostname is the FQDN of the interface being used.

.Ss Policy Specifications
The policy directive is obsolete, policies are now in the SPD.
.Xr racoon 8
will obey the policy configured into the kernel by
.Xr setkey 8 ,
and will construct phase 2 proposals by combining
.Ic sainfo
specifications in
.Nm Ns ,
and policies in the kernel.
.\"
.Ss Sainfo Specifications
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic sainfo ( Ar source_id destination_id \*(Ba Ic anonymous )
.Ic { Ar statements Ic }
.Xc
defines the parameters of the IKE phase 2 (IPSec-SA establishment).
.Ar source_id
and
.Ar destination_id
are constructed like:
.Pp
.Ic address Ar address
.Bq Ic / Ar prefix
.Bq Ic [ Ar port ]
.Ar ul_proto
.Pp
or
.Pp
.Ar idtype Ar string
.Pp
It means exactly the content of ID payload.
This is not like a filter rule.
For example, if you define 3ffe:501:4819::/48 as
.Ar source_id .
3ffe:501:4819:1000:/64 will not match.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.\"
.It Ic pfs_group Ar group ;
define the group of Diffie-Hellman exponentiations.
If you do not require PFS then you can omit this directive.
Any proposal will be accepted if you do not specify one.
.Ar group
is one of following:
.Ic modp768 , modp1024 , modp1536 .
Or you can define 1, 2, or 5 as the DH group number.
.\"
.It Ic lifetime time Ar number Ar timeunit ;
.It Ic lifetime byte Ar number Ar byteunit ;
define the lifetime of amount of time or number of bytes
which are to be used IPsec-SA.
Any proposal will be accepted, and no attribute(s) will be proposed to
the peer if you do not specify it(them).
See the
.Ic proposal_check
directive.
.\"
.It Ic identifier Ar idtype ;
is obsolete.
Instead use
.Ic my_identifier
directives.
.\"
.It Ic my_identifier Ar idtype ... ;
specifies ID type to use for the phase 2 negotiation.
address is used as the default.
See the
.Ic my_identifier
directive above in
.Ic remote
for its usage.
This is always for the initiator, not the responder.
.Xr racoon 8
as the responder can handle only the IP address type.
.El
.\"
.Pp
.Xr racoon 8
does not have the list of security protocols to be negotiated.
The list of security protocols are passed by SPD in the kernel.
Therefore you have to define all of the potential algorithms
in the phase 2 proposals even if there is a algorithm which will not be used.
These algorithms are define by using the following three directives,
and they are lined with single comma as the separator.
.Xr racoon 8
will compute the actual phase 2 proposals by computing
the permutation of the specified algorithms,
and then combining them with the security protocol specified by the SPD.
For example, if
.Ic des, 3des, hmac_md5,
and
.Ic hmac_sha1
are specified as algorithms, we have four combinations for use with ESP,
and two for AH.
Then, based on the SPD settings,
.Xr racoon 8
will construct the actual proposals.
If the SPD entry asks for ESP only, there will be 4 proposals.
If it asks for both AH and ESP, there will be 8 proposals.
Note that the kernel may not support the algorithm you have specified.

define logging level.
.Ar level
is one of following:
.Ic notify , debug
and
.Ic debug2 .
The default is
.Ic notify .
If you put too high logging level on slower machines,
IKE negotiation can fail due to timing constraint changes.

.\"
.Ss Specifying the way to pad
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic padding { Ar statements Ic }
specified padding format.
The following are valid statements:

.It Ic maximum_length Ar number ;
define a maximum padding length.
If
.Ic randomize_length is off, this is ignored.
The default is 20 bytes.
.It Ic exclusive_tail (on \(ba off) ;
means to put the number of pad bytes minus one into last part of the padding.
The default is on.
.It Ic strict_check (on \(ba off) ;
means to be constrained the peer to set the number of pad bytes.
The default is off.

.It Ic complex_bundle (on \(ba off) ;
defines the interpretation of proposal in the case of SA bundle.
Normally
.Dq IP AH ESP IP payload
is proposed as
.Dq AH tunnel and ESP tunnel .
The interpretation is more common to other IKE implementations, however,
it allows very limited set of combinations for proposals.
With the option enabled, it will be proposed as
.Dq AH transport and ESP tunnel .
The default value is
.Ic off .
.El
.\"
.Ss Pre-shared key File
Pre-shared key file defines a pair of the identifier and the shared secret key
which are used at Pre-shared key authentication method in phase 1.
The pair in each lines are separated by some number of blanks and/or tab
characters like
.Xr hosts 5 .
Key can be included any blanks because all of the words after 2nd column
are interpreted as a secret key.
Lines start with
.Ql #
are ignored.
Keys which start with
.Ql 0x
are hexa-decimal strings.
Note that the file must be owned by the user ID running
.Xr racoon 8
.Pq usually privileged user ,
and must not be accessible by others.
