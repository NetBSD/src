ISAKMP daemon.
.Xr racoon 8
negotiates security association for itself (ISAKMP SA)
and for kernel IPsec (IPsec SA).
The file consists of a sequence of directives and statements.
Each directives are composed by a tag, and statements enclosed by

.Ss Policy Specifications
The policy directive is obsoleted, policies are now in the SPD.
.Xr racoon 8
will obey the policy configured into the kernel by

and policies in the kernel.

.Bq Ic [ Ar port ]
.Ar ul_proto
.Pp
or
.Pp
.Ar idtype Ar string
.Pp
It means exactly the content of ID payload.
It is not like a filter rule.
For example, if you define 3ffe:501:4819::/48 as
.Ar source_id .
3ffe:501:4819:1000:/64 is not match with it.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.\"
.It Ic pfs_group Ar group ;
define the group of Diffie-Hellman exponentiations.
If you don't require PFS then you can omit this directive.

.Ic modp768 , modp1024 , modp1536 .
.\"
.It Ic lifetime time Ar number Ar timeunit ;

the peer if you don't specify it(them).
See
.Sx proposal_check
directive.
.\"
.It Ic identifier Ar idtype ;
is obsoleted.
Instead use
.Ic my_identifier
directives.
.\"
.It Ic my_identifier Ar idtype ... ;
specifies ID type to use phase 2 negotiation.
The type of address is used as default.
See
.Sx my_identifier
directive in
.Ic remote
for its usage.
It is always for initiator, not responder.
.Xr racoon
as responder can handle only IP address type.
.El
.\"
.Pp
.Xr racoon 8
does not have the list of security protocols to be negotiated.
The list of security protocols are passed by SPD in the kernel.
Therefore you have to define all of the potential algorithms
in phase 2 proposals even if there is a algorithm which will not be used.
These algorithms are define by using the following three directives.
.Xr racoon 8
will compute actual phase 2 proposals by computing permutation of the specified
algorithms, and then combining them with security protocol specified by SPD.
For example, if
.Ic des, 3des, hmac_md5,
and
.Ic hmac_sha1
are specified, we have four combination for use with ESP,
and two for AH.
Then, based on SPD settings,
.Xr racoon 8
will construct the actual proposals.
If the SPD entry asks for ESP only, there will be 4 proposals.
If it asks for both AH and ESP, there will be 8 proposals.
Note that the kernel may not support the algorithm you have specified.

which are used at Pre-shared key authentication method in phase 1.
The pair in each lines are separated by some number of blanks and/or tab
characters like
.Xr hosts 5 .
Key can be included any blanks because all of the words after 2nd column
are interpreted as a secret key.
Lines start with
.Ql #
