.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is a printing and pagination filter for text files.
When multiple input files are specified, each is read, formatted,
and written to standard output.
By default, the input is separated into 66-line pages, each with
.Bl -bullet
.It
A 5-line header with the page number, date, time, and
the pathname of the file.
.It
A 5-line trailer consisting of blank lines.
.El
.Pp
If standard output is associated with a terminal,
diagnostic messages are suppressed until the
.Nm
utility has completed processing.
.Pp
When multiple column output is specified,
text columns are of equal width.
By default text columns are separated by at least one
.Aq Em blank .
Input lines that do not fit into a text column are truncated.
Lines are not truncated under single column output.
.Sh OPTIONS
In the following option descriptions, column, lines, offset, page, and
width are positive decimal integers and gap is a nonnegative decimal integer.
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Ar \&+page
Begin output at page number
.Ar page
of the formatted input.
.It Fl Ar column
Produce output that is
.Ar columns
wide (default is 1) that is written vertically
down each column in the order in which the text
is received from the input file.
The options
.Fl e
and
.Fl i
are assumed.
This option should not be used with
.Fl m .
When used with
.Fl t ,
the minimum number of lines is used to display the output.
.It Fl a
Modify the effect of the
.Fl column
option so that the columns are filled across the page in a round-robin order
(e.g., when column is 2, the first input line heads column
1, the second heads column 2, the third is the second line
in column 1, etc.).
This option requires the use of the
.Fl column
option.
.It Fl d
Produce output that is double spaced.
An extra
.Aq Em newline
character is output following every
.Aq newline
found in the input.
.It Fl e Ns Oo Ar char Oc Ns Op Ar gap
Expand each input
.Aq tab
to the next greater column
position specified by the formula
.Ar n*gap+1 ,
where
.Em n
is an integer > 0.
If
.Ar gap
is zero or is omitted the default is 8.
All
.Aq Em tab
characters in the input are expanded into the appropriate
number of
.Ao Em space Ac Ns s .
If any nondigit character,
.Ar char ,
is specified, it is used as the input tab character.
If the first character of
.Ar char
is a digit then
.Ar char
is treated as
.Ar gap .
.It Fl F
Use a
.Aq Em form-feed
character for new pages,
instead of the default behavior that uses a
sequence of
.Aq Em newline
characters.
.It Fl f
Same as
.Fl F .
Additionally pause before beginning the first page
if the standard output is associated with a terminal.
.It Fl h Ar header
Use the string
.Ar header
to replace the
.Ar file name
in the header line.
.It Fl i Ns Oo Ar char Oc Ns Op Ar gap
In output, replace multiple
.Ao space Ac Ns s
with
.Ao tab Ac Ns s
whenever two or more
adjacent
.Ao space Ac Ns s
reach column positions
.Ar gap+1 ,
.Ar 2*gap+1 ,
etc.
If
.Ar gap
is zero or omitted, default
.Aq Em tab
settings at every eighth column position
is used.
If any nondigit character,
.Ar char ,
is specified, it is used as the output
.Aq Em tab
character.
If the first character of
.Ar char
is a digit then
.Ar char
is treated as
.Ar gap .
.It Fl l Ar lines
Override the 66 line default and reset the page length to
.Ar lines .
If
.Ar lines
is not greater than the sum of both the header and trailer
depths (in lines), the
.Nm
utility suppresses output of both the header and trailer, as if the
.Fl t
option were in effect.
.It Fl m
Merge the contents of multiple files.
One line from each file specified by a file operand is
written side by side into text columns of equal fixed widths, in
terms of the number of column positions.
The number of text columns depends on the number of
file operands successfully opened.
The maximum number of files merged depends on page width and the
per process open file limit.
The options
.Fl e
and
.Fl i
are assumed.
.It Fl n Ns Oo Ar char Oc Ns Op Ar width
Provide
.Ar width
digit line numbering.
The default for
.Ar width ,
if not specified, is 5.
The number occupies the first
.Ar width
column positions of each text column or each line of
.Fl m
output.
If
.Ar char
(any nondigit character) is given, it is appended to the line number to
separate it from whatever follows.
The default for
.Ar char
is a
.Aq Em tab .
Line numbers longer than
.Ar width
columns are truncated.
.It Fl o Ar offset
Each line of output is preceded by
.Ar offset
.Ao Em space Ac Ns s .
If the
.Fl o
option is not specified, the default is zero.
The space taken is in addition to the output line width.
.It Fl p
Pause before beginning each page if the
standard output is associated with a terminal.
.Nm
will write an
.Aq Em alert
to standard error and wait for a
.Aq Em carriage-return
to be read on
.Pa /dev/tty .
.It Fl r
Write no diagnostic reports on failure to open a file.
.It Fl s Ns Op Ar char
Separate text columns by the single character
.Ar char
instead of by the appropriate number of
.Ao Em space Ac Ns s
(default for
.Ar char
is the
.Aq Em tab
character).
.It Fl T
Specify an
.Xr strftime 3
format string to be used to format the date and time information in the page
header.
.It Fl t
Print neither the five-line identifying
header nor the five-line trailer usually supplied for each page.
Quit printing after the last line of each file without spacing to the
end of the page.
.It Fl w Ar width
Set the width of the line to
.Ar width
column positions for multiple text-column output only.
If the
.Fl w
option is not specified and the
.Fl s
option is not specified, the default width is 72.
If the
.Fl w
option is not specified and the
.Fl s
option is specified, the default width is 512.
.It Ar file
A pathname of a file to be printed.
If no
.Ar file
operands are specified, or if a
.Ar file
operand is
.Sq Fl ,
the standard input is used.
The standard input is used only if no
.Ar file
operands are specified, or if a
.Ar file
operand is
.Sq Fl .
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl s
option does not allow the option letter to be separated from its
argument, and the options
.Fl e ,
.Fl i ,
and
.Fl n
require that both arguments, if present, not be separated from the option
letter.
.Sh ERRORS
If
.Nm
receives an interrupt while printing to a terminal, it
flushes all accumulated error messages to the screen before
terminating.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and 1 if an error occurs.
.Pp
Error messages are written to standard error during the printing
process (if output is redirected) or after all successful
file printing is complete (when printing to a terminal).
