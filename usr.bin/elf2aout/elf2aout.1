.Dt ELF2AOUT 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm elf2aout
.Nd convert a NetBSD ELF-format executable to NetBSD a.out format
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl \&Os
.Ar elf-file
.Ar aout-file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Reads a fully-linked ELF executable (such as a  linked kernel)
and produces an equivalent a.out format executable file.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility is used to convert native
.Nx
ELF binaries
to a.out format, for compatibility with bootblocks and kernel-reading
utilities like
.Xr kvm 3 ,
which currently expect an a.out format kernel.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl O
Produce
.Dv OMAGIC
instead of
.Dv ZMAGIC
binaries which is the default.
.It Fl s
Preserve the symbol table.

.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
was originally developed for
.Nx Ns Tn /pmax
by Ted Lemon
and was first distributed with the pmax port of
.Nx 1.1 .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
assumes there are no multiply-referenced symbols in the input ELF symbol
section.
It may be necessary to link with
.Fl x
to avoid such duplicate symbols.
.Pp
In some environments, the GNU binutils
.Xr objcopy 1
utility may be a better solution than
.Nm .
