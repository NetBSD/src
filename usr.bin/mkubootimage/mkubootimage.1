.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to create an image for Das U-Boot, the
.Qq Universal Boot Loader .
.Pp
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl A No ( arm Ns | Ns arm64 Ns | Ns i386 Ns | Ns mips Ns | Ns mips64 Ns | Ns or1k Ns | Ns powerpc )
Defines the architecture.
This is required.
.It Fl a Ar address
Sets the image load address.
This is an integer between 0 and
.Dv UINT32_MAX .
This is required.
.It Fl C No ( bz2 Ns | Ns gz Ns | Ns lzma Ns | Ns lzo Ns | Ns none )
Defines the compression.
The default is
.Qq none .
.It Fl E Ar address
Define the entry point.
This is an integer between 0 and
.Dv UINT32_MAX .
This option is the same as
.Fl e
but it inverts the bytes to convert the 32 bit integer
from little to big endian (or vice versa).
If
.Fl E
or
.Fl e
are not set, the entry point defaults to the
image load address
.Pq Fl a .
.It Fl e Ar address
Define the entry point.
This is an integer between 0 and
.Dv UINT32_MAX .
If
.Fl E
or
.Fl e
are not set, the entry point defaults to the
image load address
.Pq Fl a .
.It Fl h
Display the usage and exit.
.It Fl m Ar magic
Set the magic.
This is an integer between 0 and
.Dv UINT32_MAX .
The default is
.Qq 0x27051956 .
.It Fl n Ar image
Defines the image name.
This is required.
.It Fl O No ( freebsd Ns | Ns linux Ns | Ns netbsd Ns | Ns openbsd )
Defines the operating system type.
The default OS name is
.Qq netbsd .
.It Fl T No ( fs Ns | Ns kernel Ns | Ns ramdisk Ns | Ns standalone Ns | Ns script )
Defines the image type.
This is required.
.El
.Pp
The required
.Ar source
argument is the filename of the kernel that is read.
The required
.Ar destination
argument is the filename of the image file that is created.
.\"
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Nm
returns 1 on failure to read the kernel,
generate a header, or create the image.
.\"
.Sh EXAMPLES
Before the image is written, the header is displayed to standard out;
for example:
.Bd -literal -offset 0
 magic:       0x27051956
 time:        Tue Jun  7 15:58:41 2011
 size:        2482203
 load addr:   0x00020000
 entry point: 0x00020000
 data crc:    0x700fdf53
 os:          2 (netbsd)
 arch:        7 (powerpc)
 type:        2 (kernel)
 comp:        1 (gz)
 name:        NetBSD/evbppc 5.99.52 (INSTALL_PMPPC)
 header crc:  0x94ea96cf
