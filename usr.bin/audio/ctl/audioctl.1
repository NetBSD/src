.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm audioctl
.Nd control audio device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl d Ar device
.Fl a
.Nm
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl d Ar device
.Ar name ...
.Nm
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl d Ar device
.Fl w
.Ar name=value ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command displays or sets various audio system driver variables.
If a list of variables is present on the command line, then
.Nm
prints the current value of those variables for the specified device.
If the
.Fl a
flag is specified, all variables for the device are printed.
If the
.Fl w
flag is specified
.Nm
attempts to set the specified variables to the given values.
.Pp
The
.Fl d
flag can be used to give an alternative audio control device, the default is
.Pa /dev/audioctl0 .
.Pp
The
.Fl n
flag suppresses printing of the variable name.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width AUDIOCTLDEVICE
.It Pa AUDIOCTLDEVICE
the audio control device to use.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/audioctl0 -compact
.It Pa /dev/audio0
audio I/O device (resets on open)
.It Pa /dev/audioctl0
audio control device
.It Pa /dev/sound0
audio I/O device (does not reset on open)
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To set the playing sampling rate to 11025, you can use
.Dl audioctl -w play.sample_rate=11025
To set all of the play parameters for CD-quality audio, you can use
.Dl audioctl -w play=44100,2,16,slinear_le
Note that many of the variables that can be inspected and changed with
.Nm
are reset when
.Pa /dev/audio0
is opened.
This can be circumvented by using
.Pa /dev/sound0
instead.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The old
.Fl f
flag is still supported.
This support will be removed eventually.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr audioplay 1 ,
.Xr audiorecord 1 ,
.Xr mixerctl 1 ,
.Xr audio 4 ,

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Nx 1.3 .
