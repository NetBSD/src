.Sh NAME
.Nm audiorecord
.Nd record audio files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl afhV
.Op Fl b Ar balance
.Op Fl C Ar ctl
.Op Fl c Ar channels
.Op Fl d Ar device
.Op Fl e Ar encoding
.Op Fl i Ar info
.Op Fl m Ar monvol
.Op Fl P Ar precision
.Op Fl p Ar input
.Op Fl s Ar rate
.Op Fl t Ar time
.Op Fl v Ar volume
.Op files
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program copies the audio devices to the named audiofile, or the standard
output if no file is named.
The output file will contain a Sun/NeXT audio header.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width 123456
.It Fl a
Append to the specified file, rather than overwriting.
.It Fl b
Set the balance to
.Ar balance .
This value must be between 0 and 63.
.It Fl C
Set the audio control device to be
.Ar ctl .
The default is
.Pa /dev/audioctl0 .
.It Fl c
Set number of channels to
.Ar channels .
.It Fl d
Set the audio device to be
.Ar device .
The default is
.Pa /dev/audio0 .
.It Fl e
Set encoding to either
.Dq alaw ,
.Dq ulaw
or
.Dq linear .
The default encoding is
.Dq ulaw .
.It Fl f
Force.  Normally when appending to audiofiles using the
.Fl a
option, the sample rates must match.  The
.Fl f
option will allow a discrepancy to be ignored.
.It Fl h
Print a help message.
.It Fl i
If the audio device cannot be opened, exit now rather than wait for it.
.It Fl m
Set the monitor volume.
.It Fl P
Set the precision.  This value is the number of bits per sample, and is
normally either
.Dq 8
or
.Dq 16 ,
though the values
.Dq 4 ,
.Dq 24
and
.Dq 32
are also valid.
.It Fl p
Set the output port to
.Ar port .
The valid values of
.Ar port
are
.Dq speaker ,
.Dq headphone
and
.Dq line .
.It Fl s
Set the sampling rate.  This value is per-second.  Typical values are
8000, 44100 and 48000, which are the telephone, CD Audio and DAT Audio
default sampling rates.
.It Fl t
Sets the maximum amount of time to record.  Format is [hh:]mm:ss.
.It Fl q
Be quiet.
.It Fl V
Be verbose.
.It Fl v
Set the volume (gain) to
.Ar volume .
This value must be between 0 and 255.
