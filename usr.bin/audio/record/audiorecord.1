.Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program copies the audio device to the named audiofile or,
if the file name is -, to the standard output.
.Pp
The output file will contain either a Sun/NeXT audio header, a
RIFF/WAVE audio header or no header at all.
Sun output files using a linear PCM encoding are written with big-endian
signed samples, possibly after converting these from little-endian or
unsigned samples.
RIFF/WAVE files are written in little-endian, signed samples, also
converting if necessary.
The default output is Sun/NeXT format, but if the output file
.Ar file
ends with a
.Pa .wav
file extension it will be written as RIFF/WAVE.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width XpXprecisionX
.It Fl a
Append to the specified file, rather than overwriting.
.It Fl B Ar buffersize
Set the audio device read buffer size to
.Ar buffersize .
The default value is the record.buffer_size of the audio device.
.It Fl b Ar balance
Set the balance to
.Ar balance .
This value must be between 0 and 63.
.It Fl c Ar channels
Set number of channels to
.Ar channels .
.It Fl d Ar device
Set the audio device to be
.Ar device .
The default is
.Pa /dev/sound .
.It Fl e Ar encoding
Set encoding to either
.Dq alaw ,
.Dq ulaw ,
or
.Dq linear ,
or any other value reported by
.Ic audioctl encodings .
The default encoding is
.Dq ulaw .
If the output format is
.Dq sun ,
the file will contain slinear_be samples, if it is
.Dq wav ,
then slinear_le, independent of the argument to
.Fl e .
Setting the argument to
.Fl e
still may be important since it is used in an
.Xr ioctl 2
call to the kernel to choose the kind of data provided.
.It Fl F Ar format
Set the output header format to
.Ar format .
Currently supported formats are
.Dq sun ,
.Dq wav ,
and
.Dq none
for Sun/NeXT audio, WAV, and no header, respectively.
.It Fl f
Force.
Normally when appending to audiofiles using the
.Fl a
option, the sample rates must match.
The
.Fl f
option will allow a discrepancy to be ignored.
.It Fl h
Print a help message.
.It Fl i Ar info
If supported by the
.Fl F
format, add the string
.Ar info
to the output header.
.It Fl m Ar monvol
Set the monitor volume.
.It Fl P Ar precision
Set the precision.
This value is the number of bits per sample, and is normally either
.Dq 8
or
.Dq 16 ,
though the values
.Dq 4 ,
.Dq 24 ,
and
.Dq 32
are also valid.
.It Fl p Ar port
Set the input port to
.Ar port .
The valid values of
.Ar port
are
.Dq cd ,
.Dq internal-cd ,
.Dq mic ,
and
.Dq line .
.It Fl q
Be quiet.
.It Fl s Ar rate
Set the sampling rate.
This value is per-second.
Typical values are 8000, 44100, and 48000, which are the telephone,
CD Audio, and DAT Audio default sampling rates.
.It Fl t Ar time
Sets the maximum amount of time to record.
Format is [hh:]mm:ss[.dddddd].
.It Fl V
Be verbose.
.It Fl v Ar volume
Set the volume (gain) to
.Ar volume .
This value must be between 0 and 255.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width AUDIOCTLDEVICE
.It AUDIOCTLDEVICE
the audio control device to be used.
.It AUDIODEVICE
the audio device to be used.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
program was first seen in SunOS 5.
It was first made available in
.Nx 1.4 .
RIFF/WAVE support, and support for converting signed/unsigned and
big/little-endian samples was first made available in
.Nx 1.6 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
program was written by
.An Matthew R. Green Aq Mt mrg@eterna.com.au .
.Sh BUGS
WAV big-endian samples are converted to little-endian, rather than
a RIFX header being written.
