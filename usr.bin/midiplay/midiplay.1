.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl p Ar pgm

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command plays MIDI and RMID files using the sequencer device.
If no file name is given it will play from standard input, otherwise
it will play the named files.
.Pp
RMID files are Standard MIDI Files embedded in a RIFF container and
can usually be found with the
.Sq rmi
extension.
They contain some
additional information in other chunks which are not parsed by
.Nm
yet.
.Pp
The program accepts the following options:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl d Ar devno
specifies the number of the MIDI device used for output (as listed
by the
.Fl l
flag).
There is no way at present to have
.Nm
map playback to more than one device.
The default is device is given by environment variable
.Ev MIDIUNIT .
.It Fl f Ar file
specifies the name of the sequencer device.
.It Fl l
list the possible devices without playing anything.
.It Fl m
show MIDI file meta events (copyright, lyrics, etc).
.It Fl p Ar pgm
force all channels to play with the single specified
program (or instrument patch, range 1-128).
Program change events in the file will be suppressed.
There is no way at present to have
.Nm
selectively map channels or instruments.
.It Fl q
specifies that the MIDI file should not be played, just parsed.
.It Fl s
send an
.Dq ALL SOUNDS OFF
MIDI event.
Useful if an interrupted MIDI file left notes playing.
.It Fl t Ar tempo-adjust
specifies an adjustment (in percent) to the tempi recorded in the file.
The default of 100 plays as specified in the file, 50 halves every tempo,
and so on.
.It Fl v
be verbose.
If the flag is repeated the verbosity increases.
.It Fl x
play a small sample sound instead of a file.
.El
.Pp
A file containing no tempo indication will be played as if it specified
150 beats per minute.
You have been warned.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width MIDIUNIT
.It Ev MIDIUNIT
the default number of the MIDI device used for output.
The default is 0.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/music
.It Pa /dev/music
MIDI sequencer device

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Nx 1.4 .
.Sh BUGS
It may take a long while before playing stops when
.Nm
is interrupted, as the data already buffered in the sequencer will contain
timing events.
Use
.Nm
with the
.Fl s
option to silence any sounds left after an interrupted call.
