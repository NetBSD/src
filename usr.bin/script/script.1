.Dt SCRIPT 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm script
.Nd make typescript of terminal session
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl adfpqr
.Op Fl c Ar command
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
makes a typescript of everything printed on your terminal.
It is useful for students who need a hardcopy record of an interactive
session as proof of an assignment, as the typescript file
can be printed out later with
.Xr lpr 1 .
.Pp
If the argument
.Ar file
is given,
.Nm
saves all dialogue in
.Ar file .
If no file name is given, the typescript is saved in the file
.Pa typescript  .
.Pp
Option:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Append the output to
.Ar file
or
.Pa typescript ,
retaining the prior contents.
.It Fl c Ar command
Run the named
.Ar command
instead of the shell.
Useful for capturing the output of a program that behaves differently when
associated with a tty.
.It Fl d
When playing back a session with the
.Fl p
flag, don't sleep between records when playing back a timestamped session.
.It Fl f
Flush output after each write.
This is useful for watching the script output in real time.
.It Fl p
Play back a session recorded with the
.Fl r
flag in real time.
.It Fl q
Be quiet, and don't output started and ended lines.
.It Fl r
Record a session with input, output, and timestamping.
.El
.Pp
The script ends when the forked shell exits (a
.Em control-D
to exit
the Bourne shell
.Pf ( Xr sh 1 ) ,
and
.Em exit ,
.Em logout
or
.Em control-d
(if
.Em ignoreeof
is not set) for the
C-shell,
.Xr csh 1 ) .
.Pp
Certain interactive commands, such as
.Xr vi 1 ,
create garbage in the typescript file.
.Nm
works best with commands that do not manipulate the
screen, the results are meant to emulate a hardcopy
terminal.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variable is used by
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width SHELL
.It Ev SHELL
If the variable
.Ev SHELL
exists, the shell forked by
.Nm
will be that shell.
If
.Ev SHELL
is not set, the Bourne shell
is assumed.
(Most shells set this variable automatically).
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr csh 1
(for the
.Em history
mechanism).
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
places
.Sy everything
in the log file, including linefeeds and backspaces.
This is not what the naive user expects.
