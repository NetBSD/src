.Sh NAME
.Nm gettext
.Nd message translation front-end
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl h
.Nm
.Op Fl en
.Op Ar textdomain
.Ar msgid
.Nm
.Fl s
.Op Fl n
.Op Ar msgid...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
attempts to translate a given
.Ar msgid
into the locale-specific string as determined by the environment.
If a translation file is not found, or a translation for the given
.Ar msgid
is not found, the original string will be echoed.
.Pp
If the
.Ar textdomain
is not provided as an argument, the
.Ev textdomain
environment variable will be consulted instead.
.Pp
By default
.Nm
will look for message catalogs in
.Pa /usr/share/locale .
If the environment variable
.Ev TEXTDOMAINDIR
is defined, then that will override the default location.
.Pp
The following flags are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl e
Interpret backslash escape sequences prior to translation.
.It Fl h
Print the usage information
.It Fl n
If
.Fl s
is used, do not add the trailing newline. If
.Fl s
is not provided, this flag will do nothing.
.It Fl s
Act similarly to
.Xr echo 1 .
All
.Ar msgid
arguments will be translated, and a newline will be appended to the output
string.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ev TEXTDOMAIN
The domain to use when looking up
.Ar msgids
.It Ev TEXTDOMAINDIR
The location of message catalogs to use, overriding
