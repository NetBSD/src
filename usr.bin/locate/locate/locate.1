.Sh NAME
.Nm locate
.Nd find files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d Ar dbpath
.Ar pattern
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
searches a database for all pathnames which match the specified
.Ar pattern  .
The database is recomputed periodically, and contains the pathnames
of all files which are publicly accessible.
.Pp
Shell globbing and quoting characters (``*'', ``?'', ``\e'', ``[''
and ``]'')
may be used in
.Ar pattern  ,
although they will have to be escaped from the shell.
Preceding any character with a backslash (``\e'') eliminates any special
meaning which it may have.
The matching differs in that no characters must be matched explicitly,
including slashes (``/'').
.Pp
As a special case, a pattern containing no globbing characters (``foo'')
is matched as though it were ``*foo*''.
.Pp
Options:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl d Ar dbpath
Sets the list of databases to search to
.Ar dbpath
which can name one or more database files separated by ``:'',
an empty component in the list represents the default database.
The environment variable
.Ar LOCATE_PATH
has the same effect.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb -compact
.It Pa /var/db/locate.database
Default database
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
exits with a 0 if a match is found, and >0 if no match is found or if
another problem (such as a missing or corrupted database file) is
encountered.
