 *	4) An FILE* for writing out the commands. This is only

 *	   the descriptors of our pipe, an array in which output is line
 *	   buffered and the current position in that buffer are all
 *	   maintained for each job.
 *	6) A word of flags which determine how the module handles errors,
 *	   echoing, etc. for the job
 *
 * When a job is finished, the Make_Update function is called on each of the
 * parents of the node which was just remade. This takes care of the upward
 * traversal of the dependency graph.

 * Shell Specifications:
 * Each shell type has associated with it the following information:
 *	1) The string which must match the last character of the shell name
 *	   for the shell to be considered of this type. The longest match
 *	   wins.
 *	2) A command to issue to turn off echoing of command lines
 *	3) A command to issue to turn echoing back on again
 *	4) What the shell prints, and its length, when given the echo-off
 *	   command. This line will not be printed when received from the shell
 *	5) A boolean to tell if the shell has the ability to control
 *	   error checking for individual commands.
 *	6) The string to turn this checking on.
 *	7) The string to turn it off.
 *	8) The command-flag to give to cause the shell to start echoing
 *	   commands right away.
 *	9) The command-flag to cause the shell to Lib_Exit when an error is
 *	   detected in one of the commands.
 *
 * Some special stuff goes on if a shell doesn't have error control. In such
 * a case, errCheck becomes a printf template for echoing the command,
 * should echoing be on and ignErr becomes another printf template for
 * executing the command while ignoring the return status. Finally errOut
 * is a printf template for running the command and causing the shell to 
 * exit on error. If any of these strings are empty when hasErrCtl is FALSE, 
 * the command will be executed anyway as is and if it causes an error, so be 
 * it. Any templates setup to echo the command will escape any '$ ` \ "'i
 * characters in the command string to avoid common problems with 
 * echo "%s\n" as a template.
