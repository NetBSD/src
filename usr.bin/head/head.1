lines of each of the specified files, or of the standard input if no
files are specified.
If
.Ar count
is omitted it defaults to 10.
If
.Fl c Ar byte_count
is specified,
.Nm
counts bytes instead of lines.

If more than a single file is specified, or the
.Fl v
option is used, each file is preceded by a header consisting of the string

is the name of the file.
The
.Fl q
flag disables the printing of the header in all cases.
