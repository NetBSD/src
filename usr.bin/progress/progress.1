.Sh NAME
.Nm progress
.Nd feed input to a command, displaying a progress bar
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl z
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl l Ar length
.Ar cmd
.Op Ar args ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility opens a pipe to
.Ar cmd
and feeds an input stream into it, while displaying a progress bar to
standard output.
If no filename is specified,
.Nm
reads from standard input.
Where feasible,
.Nm
.Xr fstat 2 Ns s
the input to determine the length, so a time estimate can be calculated.
.Pp
If no length is specified or determined,
.Nm
simply displays a count of the data and the data rate.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XlXlengthXX
.It Fl f Ar file
Read from the specified
.Ar file
instead of standard input.
.It Fl l Ar length
Use the specified length for the time estimate, rather than attempting to
.Xr fstat 2
the input.
.It Fl z
Filter the input through
.Xr gzip 1 .
If
.Fl f
is specified, calculate the length using
.Ic gzip -l .
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
exits 0 on success.
.\" .Sh ENVIRONMENT
.\" .Sh FILES
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command
.Ic progress -zf file.tar.gz tar xf -
will extract the
.Pa file.tar.gz
displaying the progress bar as time passes:
.Bd -literal

If it is preferred to monitor the progress of the decompression
process (unlikely), then
.Ic progress -f file.tar.gz tar zxf -
could be used.

.Sh BUGS
Since the progress bar is displayed asynchronously, it may be
difficult to read some error messages, both those produced by the
pipeline, as well as those produced by
.Nm
itself.
