.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
can be used to output or modify the state of a USB HID (Human Interface
Device).
If a list of items is present on the command line, then
.Nm
prints the current value of those items for the specified device.
If the
.Fl w
flag is specified
.Nm
attempts to set the specified items to the given values.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Show all items and their current values.
This option fails if the device does not support the
.Dv GET_REPORT
command.
.It Fl f Ar device
Specify a path name for the device to operate on.
If
.Ar device
is numeric, it is taken to be the USB HID device number.
If it is a relative
path, it is taken to be the name of the device under
.Pa /dev .
An absolute path is taken to be the literal device pathname.
.It Fl l
Loop and dump the device data every time it changes.
Only 'input' items are displayed in this mode.
.It Fl n
Suppress printing of the item name when querying specific items.
Only output the current value.
.It Fl r
Dump the USB HID report descriptor.
.It Fl t Ar table
Specify a path name for the HID usage table file.
.It Fl v
Be verbose.
Repeating this option increases verbosity.
.It Fl w
Change item values.
Only 'output' and 'feature' kinds can be set with this
option.
.It Fl z
Reset all feature and output flags to zero before attempting to change them.
May be required for changing item values (via
.Fl w )
on devices that don't implement
.Dv GET_REPORT .
.El
.Sh FILES
.Pa /usr/share/misc/usb_hid_usages
The default HID usage table.
.Sh SYNTAX
.Nm
parses the names of items specified on the command line against the human
interface items reported by the USB device.
Each human interface item is
mapped from its native form to a human readable name, using the HID usage
table file.
Command line items are compared with the generated item names,
and the USB HID device is operated on when a match is found.
.Pp
Each human interface item is named by the
.Qq page
it appears in, the
.Qq usage
within that page, and the list of
.Qq collections
containing the item.
Each collection in turn is also identified by page, and
the usage within that page.
.Pp
On the
.Nm
command line the page name is separated from the usage name with the character
.Sq Cm \&: .
The collections are separated by the character
.Sq Cm \&. .
.Pp
As an alternative notation in items on the command line, the native numeric
value for the page name or usage can be used instead of the full human
readable page name or usage name.
Numeric values can be specified in decimal,
octal or hexadecimal.
.Pp
Some devices give the same name to more than one item.
.Nm
supports isolating each item by appending a
.Sq Cm \&# .
character and a decimal item instance number, starting at zero.
.Sh EXAMPLES
On a standard USB mouse the item
.Dl Generic_Desktop:Mouse.Generic_Desktop:Pointer.Button:Button_2
reflects the current status of button 2.
The
.Qq button 2
item is encapsulated within two collections, the
.Qq Mouse
collection in the
.Qq Generic Desktop
page, and the
.Qq Pointer
collection in the
.Qq Generic Desktop
page.
The item itself is the usage
.Qq Button_2
in the
.Qq Button
page.
.Pp
An item can generally be named by omitting one or more of the page names.
For example the
.Qq button 2
item would usually just be referred to on the command line as:
.Dl usbhidctl -f /dev/mouse Mouse.Pointer.Button_2
.Pp
Items can also be named by referring to parts of the item name with the
numeric representation of the native HID usage identifiers.
This is most
useful when items are missing from the HID usage table.
The page identifier for the
.Qq Generic Desktop
page is 1, and the usage identifier for the usage
.Qq Button_2
is 2, so the following can be used to refer to the
.Qq button 2
item:
.Dl usbhidctl -f /dev/mouse 1:Mouse.1:Pointer.Button:2
.Pp
Devices with human interface outputs can be manipulated with the
.Fl w
option.
For example, some USB mice have a Light Emitting Diode under software
control as usage 2 under page 0xffff, in the
.Qq Mouse
collection.
The following can be used to switch this LED off:
.Dl usbhidctl -f /dev/mouse -w Mouse.0xffff:2=0
.Pp
The output below is from a device that uses the same name repeatedly.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% usbhidctl -f /dev/uhid0 -a
Consumer_Control.Volume_Up=0
Consumer_Control.Volume_Down=0
Consumer_Control.Mute=0
Consumer_Control.Unassigned=0
Consumer_Control.Unassigned=0
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Qq Consumer_Control.Unassigned
name is used twice.
Each can be individually accessed by providing an instance number.
For example, to set the value for the first item:
.Dl usbhidctl -f /dev/uhid0 -w 'Consumer_Control.Unassigned#0=1'
.Pp
Another example is configuring multimedia keys on a keyboard.
First you would look in the
.Xr dmesg 8
output, which
.Xr uhid 4
devices are attached to the keyboard's
.Xr uhidev 4
device and use
.Nm
to see how the controls are reported:
.Dl usbhidctl -f /dev/uhidX -lv -a
Then press the special keys; you should see something like
.Dv Consumer:Volume_Up
etc.
Then create a configuration file containing the actions, like:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Consumer:Volume_Up      1       /usr/pkg/bin/dcop amarok player volumeUp &
Consumer:Volume_Down    1       /usr/pkg/bin/dcop amarok player volumeDown &
Consumer:Mute           1       /usr/pkg/bin/dcop amarok player mute &
.Ed
and use
.Dl usbhidaction -c /path/to/file -f /dev/uhidX
once during your X startup.
