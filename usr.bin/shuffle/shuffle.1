.Sh NAME
.Nm shuffle
.Nd print a random permutation of the command line arguments
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl 0
.Op Fl f Ar filename ...
.Op Fl n Ar number
.Op Fl p Ar number
.Op Ar arg
.Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program prints a random permutation (or
.Dq shuffle )
of its command line arguments.
This can be useful in shell scripts for selecting a
random order in which to do a set of tasks, view a set of files, etc.
.Pp
If the
.Fl f
option is given, the data is taken from that files' contents or if the
filename is
.Ar -
.Dq stdin .
.Pp
If the
.Fl n
option is given, its argument is treated as a number, and the program
prints a random permutation of the numbers greater than or equal to 0
and less than the argument.
.Pp
If the
.Fl p
option is given, its argument is treated as a number, and the program
prints that number of randomly selected lines or arguments in a random order.
.Pp
The
.Fl 0
option, changes the field separator char from a \en to \e0, so that it
is suitable to be sent to
.Xr xargs 1
with
.Fl 0 
to handle filenames with whitespace in them.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ shuffle a b c d
c

$ shuffle -p 1 a b c d

$ shuffle -n 4 -p 2

program first appeared in

.Sh BUGS
The random number generator isn't that great, and thus the
permutations often aren't that great.
