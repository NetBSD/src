.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads each
.Ar file
operand and searches for sequences of the form

as inserted by SCCS and SCCS-compatible version control systems.
It prints the remainder of the string following this marker, up to
a null character, newline, double quote, backslash, or
.Dq \&>
character.
.Pp
If the
.Fl s
option is specified, only the first occurrence of an identification string in
each file is printed.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 if any matches were found, and 1 otherwise.
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility conforms to
.St -xpg4.2 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.0 .
.Sh BUGS
As
.Bx
is not licensed to distribute
.Tn SCCS
this is a rewrite of the
.Nm
command which is part of
.Tn SCCS ,
and may not behave exactly the same as that command does.
