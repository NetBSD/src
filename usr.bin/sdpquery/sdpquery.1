messages to standard error.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl a Ar address"
.It Fl a Ar address
Connect to the remote device with the specified address.
The address can be specified as BD_ADDR or a name.

.Xr bt_gethostbyname 3 .
If no remote address is given,
.Nm
attempts to contact a local SDP server via the control socket.

Specify path to the control socket.
The default path is
.Pa /var/run/sdp .
.It Fl d Ar device
