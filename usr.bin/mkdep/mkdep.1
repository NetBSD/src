.Sh NAME
.Nm mkdep
.Nd construct Makefile dependency list
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl aDdiopqv
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl P Ar prefix
.Op Fl s Ar suffixes
.Li --
.Op Ar flags
.Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
takes a set of flags for the C compiler and a list
of C source files as arguments and constructs a set of include
file dependencies which are written into the file ``.depend''.
An example of its use in a Makefile might be:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
CFLAGS= -O -I../include
SRCS= file1.c file2.c

depend:
	mkdep -- ${CFLAGS} ${SRCS}
.Ed
.Pp
where the macro SRCS is the list of C source files and the macro
CFLAGS is the list of flags for the C compiler.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Append to the output file,
so that multiple
.Nm Ns 's
may be run from a single Makefile.
.It Fl D
Post process (as
.Fl d )
but read the list of filenames from stdin.
.It Fl d
Post process and merge previously created (for example by
.Dq cc -MD x.c )
depend files into a single file.
.It Fl f
Write the include file dependencies to
.Ar file ,
instead of the default ``.depend''.
.It Fl i
When
.Fl d
or
.Fl D
is used, instead of inlining the contents of the files to the resulting
depend file, use include statements to include the source dependency files.
.It Fl o
Add an additional .OPTIONAL line for each dependent file.
.It Fl P
Prepend the string given in
.Ar prefix
to every target filename.
This is useful for programs that have source files in multiple subdirectories
and a single Makefile that references all of them explicitly (without using
the VPATH functionality because there can be files with the same name in
each subdirectory).
.It Fl p
Cause
.Nm
to produce dependencies of the form:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
program: program.c
.Ed
.Pp
so that subsequent makes will produce
.Ar program
directly from its C module rather than using an intermediate
.Pa \&.o
module.
This is useful for programs whose source is contained in a single
module.
.Fl p
is equivalent to specifying a null suffix with
.Fl s .
.It Fl q
Do not print a warning for inaccessible files when
.Fl d
is given.
.It Fl s
Expand each target filename to a list, replacing the
.Ql \&.o
suffix with each element of
.Ar suffixes .
The list of suffixes may be space or comma separated.
.It Fl v
print debugging output.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width .depend -compact
.It Pa .depend
File containing list of dependencies.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cc 1 ,
.Xr cpp 1 ,
.Xr make 1
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.3 Tahoe .
.Sh BUGS
Some characters special to
.Xr make 1 ,
most notably the comment character, are not escaped correctly if they
appear in file names.
This can lead to unparseable output or silently cause dependencies to
be lost.
