.Sh NAME
.Nm time
.Nd time command execution
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl lp
.Ar utility
.Op Ar argument ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
executes and
times
.Ar utility .
After the
.Ar utility
finishes,
.Nm
writes the total time elapsed,
the time consumed by system overhead,
and the time used to execute
.Ar utility
to the standard error stream.
Times are reported in seconds.
.Pp
Available options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl l
Lists resource utilization information.
The contents of the
.Ar utility
process'
.Em rusage
structure are printed, see below.
.It Fl p
The output is formatted as specified by
.St -p1003.2-92 .
.El
.Pp
Some shells, such as
.Xr csh 1
and
.Xr ksh 1 ,
have their own and syntactically different builtin version of
.Nm .
The utility described here
is available as
.Pa /usr/bin/time
to users of these shells.
.Ss Resource Utilization
If the
.Fl l
option is given, the following resource usage
informations are displayed
in addition to the timing information:
.Bl -item -offset indent -compact
.It
maximum resident set size
.It
average shared memory size
.It
average unshared data size
.It
average unshared stack size
.It
page reclaims
.It
page faults
.It
swaps
.It
block input operations
.It
block output operations
.It
messages sent
.It
messages received
.It
signals received
.It
voluntary context switches
.It
involuntary context switches
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It 1-125
An error occurred in the
.Nm
utility.
.It 126
The
.Ar utility
was found but could not be invoked.
.It 127
The
.Ar utility
could not be found.
.El
.Pp
Otherwise, the exit status of
.Nm
will be that of
.Ar utility .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width \*[Lt]sys/resource.h\*[Gt] -compact
.It \*[Lt]sys/resource.h\*[Gt]
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr csh 1 ,
.Xr ksh 1 ,
.Xr getrusage 2
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility conforms to
.St -p1003.2-92 .
.Sh BUGS
The granularity of seconds on microprocessors is crude and
can result in times being reported for CPU usage which are too large by
a second.
