.Sh NAME
.Nm sockstat
.Nd list open sockets
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl 46clnu
.Op Fl f Ar address_family
.Op Fl p Ar ports
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command lists open Internet or
.Ux
domain sockets.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl 4
Show
.Dv AF_INET
(IPv4) sockets.
.It Fl 6
Show
.Dv AF_INET6
(IPv6) sockets.
.It Fl c
Show connected sockets.
.It Fl f Ar address_family
Limit listed sockets to those of the specified
.Ar address_family .
The following address families
are recognized:
.Ar inet ,
for
.Dv AF_INET ;
.Ar inet6 ,
for
.Dv AF_INET6 ;
and
.Ar local
or
.Ar unix ,
for
.Dv AF_LOCAL .
.It Fl l
Show listening sockets.
.It Fl n
Numeric output only.
No attempt will be made to look up symbolic names for addresses
and ports.
.It Fl p Ar ports
Only show Internet sockets if either the local or foreign port number
is on the specified list.
The
.Ar ports
argument is a comma-separated list of port numbers and ranges
specified as first and last port separated by a dash.
.It Fl u
Show
.Dv AF_LOCAL
.Pq Ux
sockets.
.El
.Pp
If neither
.Fl 4 , 6 ,
nor
.Fl u
are specified,
.Nm
will list sockets in all three domains.
.Pp
If neither
.Fl c
nor
.Fl l
are specified,
.Nm
will list both listening and connected sockets, as well as those
sockets that are in neither state.
.Pp
The information listed for each
socket is:
.Bl -tag -width "FOREIGN ADDRESS"
.It Li USER
The user who owns the socket.
.It Li COMMAND
The command which holds the socket.
.It Li PID
The process ID of the command which holds the socket.
.It Li FD
The file descriptor number of the socket.
.It Li PROTO
The transport protocol associated with the socket for Internet
sockets, or the type of socket (stream, seqpacket or datagram) for
.Ux
sockets.
.It Li LOCAL ADDRESS
For Internet sockets, this is the address to which the local end
of the socket is bound (see
.Xr getsockname 2 ) .
For bound
.Ux
sockets, it is the socket's filename or
.Dq - .
.It Li FOREIGN ADDRESS
The address to which the foreign end of the socket is bound (see
.Xr getpeername 2 )
or
.Dq -
for unconnected
.Ux
sockets.
