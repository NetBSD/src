.Dt RLOGIN 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rlogin
.Nd remote login
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl 468dEn
.Op Fl e Ar char
.Op Fl l Ar username
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Ar host
.Nm
.Op Fl 468dEn
.Op Fl e Ar char
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Ar username@host
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
starts a terminal session on a remote host
.Ar host .
.Pp
.Nm
first attempts to use the standard Berkeley
.Em rhosts
authorization mechanism.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XlXusernameX
.It Fl 4
Use IPv4 addresses only.
.It Fl 6
Use IPv6 addresses only.
.It Fl 8
The
.Fl 8
option allows an eight-bit input data path at all times; otherwise
parity bits are stripped except when the remote side's stop and start
characters are other than
.Sq \&^S/^Q .
.It Fl d
The
.Fl d
option turns on socket debugging (see
.Xr setsockopt 2 )
on the TCP sockets used for communication with the remote host.
.It Fl E
The
.Fl E
option stops any character from being recognized as an escape character.
When used with the
.Fl 8
option, this provides a completely transparent connection.
.It Fl e Ar char
The
.Fl e
option allows user specification of the escape character, which is
.Dq \&~
by default.
This specification may be as a literal character, or as an octal
value in the form \ennn.
.It Fl l Ar username
the
.Fl l
option specifies an alternate
.Ar username
for the remote login.
If this option is not specified, your local username will be used.
.It Fl n
Set the
.Dv TCP_NODELAY
socket option,
which can improve interactive responsiveness at the possible downside of
increased network load.
.It Fl p Ar port
Uses the given
.Ar port
instead of the one assigned to the service
.Dq login .
May be given either as symbolic name or as number.
.El
.Pp
A line of the form
.Dq Ao escape char Ac Ns \&.
disconnects from the remote host.
Similarly, the line
.Dq Ao escape char Ac Ns ^Z
will suspend the
.Nm
session, and
.Dq Ao escape char Ac Ns Aq delayed-suspend char
suspends the
send portion of the rlogin, but allows output from the remote system.
By default, the tilde
.Pq Dq \&~
character is the escape character, and normally control-Y
.Pq Dq \&^Y
is the delayed-suspend character.
.Pp
All echoing takes place at the remote site, so that (except for delays) the
.Nm
is transparent.
Flow control via ^S/^Q and flushing of input and output on interrupts
are handled properly.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variable is used by
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width TERM
.It Ev TERM
Determines the user's terminal type.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
.Sh BUGS
More of the environment should be propagated.
