.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a means of using a processor's performance-monitoring counter (PMC)
facility to measure various aspects of a program's execution.
It is

.Xr time 1 .
.Pp
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl h
Display a list of performance counter events available on
the system.
.It Fl C
Cancel any performance counters that are currently running.
.It Fl c Ar event
Count the event specified by
.Ar event
while running the command.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Nx 1.6 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
command was written by
.An Frank van der Linden Aq fvdl@wasabisystems.com .
The kernel support for reading performance counters on the i386
architecture was written by
