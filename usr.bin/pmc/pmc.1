.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pmc
.Nd performance-monitoring counter interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pmc
.Ar command
.Op Ar arguments
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command can be used to control and inspect the state of CPUs in the system.
.Pp
The first argument,
.Ar command ,
specifies the action to take.
Valid commands are:
.Bl -tag -width offline
.It list
Display a list of performance counter events available on the system.
.It start Ar name:option Op Ar name:option ...
Start one or several counters.
.Ar name
specifies the name of the event to count; it must be taken from the list of
available events.
.Ar option
specifies the source of the event; it must be a combination of
.Ar u
(userland) and
.Ar k
(kernel).
.It stop
Stop any performance counters that are currently running, and display the
values of these counters.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following command prints the available counters.
.Dl $ pmc list
.Pp
The following command starts two counters.
The former will count the 'l2cache-access' events that are triggered from
userland, the latter will count the 'l1cache-access' events triggered from
both userland and the kernel.
.Dl $ pmc start l2cache-access:u l1cache-access:uk
.Pp
Note that the two following commands are not exactly identical.
.Dl $ pmc start l1cache-access:u l1cache-access:k
.Dl $ pmc start l1cache-access:uk
The former will start two different counters that have a different source but
track the same event.
The latter will start one counter that tracks the event from all sources;
it therefore does the sum of the two counters from the first command, but
takes only one counter to do so.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It PMC support not compiled into the kernel
Performance-monitoring counter support has not been compiled into the
kernel.
It may be included using the
.Em PMC
option.
See
.Xr options 4
for details.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr options 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Nx 1.6 .
It was revamped in 2017.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
command currently only supports performance-monitoring counters
on the i386 architecture.
