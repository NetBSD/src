.Sh NAME
.Nm fpr
.Nd print Fortran file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a filter that transforms files formatted according to
Fortran's carriage control conventions into files formatted
according to
.Ux
line printer conventions.
.Pp
.Nm
copies its input onto its output, replacing the carriage
control characters with characters that will produce the intended
effects when printed using
.Xr lpr 1 .
The first character of each line determines the vertical spacing as follows:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent -compact
.Bl -column Blank "To first line of next page"
.It Blank	One line
.It 0	Two lines
.It 1	To first line of next page
.It +	\&No advance
.El
.Ed
.Pp
A blank line is treated as if its first character is a blank.
A blank that appears as a carriage control character is deleted.
A zero is changed to a newline.
A one is changed to a form feed.
The effects of a
.Sq +
are simulated using backspaces.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl a.out \&| fpr \&| lpr
.Pp
.Dl fpr < f77.output \&| lpr
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command
appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
.Sh BUGS
Results are undefined for input lines longer than 170 characters.
