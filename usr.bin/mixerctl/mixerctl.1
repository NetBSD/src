.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command displays or sets various audio system mixing variables.
If a list of variables is present on the command line, then
.Nm
prints the current value of those variables for the specified device.
If the
.Fl a
flag is specified, all variables for the device are printed.
If the
.Fl w
flag is specified,
.Nm
attempts to set the specified variables to the given values.
.Pp
The
.Fl d
flag can be used to give an alternative mixer device.
The default is
.Pa /dev/mixer .
.Pp
The
.Fl n
flag suppresses printing of the variable name.
.Pp
The
.Fl v
flag shows the possible values of enumeration and set valued
variables.
Enumerated values are shown in brackets
.Pq Dq []
and set values are shown in curly braces
.Pq Dq {} .
.Pp
The exact set of controls that can be manipulated depends on
the mixer.
The general format (in both getting and setting a value) is
.br
.Va "class.name" = value
.br
.Va class
can have values like
.Li inputs
or
.Li outputs ,
indicating that the control affects the input or output
of the mixer, respectively.
.Va name
indicates what part of the mixer the control affects.
Continuous mixer values, e.g., volume, have numeric values
in the range 0\-255.
If
.Va value
can be set for each channel independently, the values are printed
separated by commas.
Discrete mixer values, e.g., the recording source, have symbolic names.
Depending on the mixer it may either be an enumeration or a set.
.Pp
The suffixes ++ and -- can be used to step through the values of a
mixer control.
For numeric controls, these operators increase or decrease, respectively,
the value by an amount (the delta) suitable to make
the control assume the next possible value.
For binary controls, these operators toggle between
.Li on
and
.Li off .
.Pp
The operators += and -= change the value of a mixer control by the
indicated number of steps.

flag is still supported.
This support will be removed eventually.
