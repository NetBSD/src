.Sh NAME
.Nm soelim
.Nd eliminate .so's from nroff input
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl I Ar directory
.Op Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads the specified files or the standard input and performs the textual
inclusion implied by the
.Xr nroff 1
directives of the form:
.Pp
.Dl \&.so somefile
.Pp
The directives need to appear at the beginning of input lines.
This is useful since programs such as
.Xr tbl 1
do not normally do this; it allows the placement of individual tables
in separate files to be run as a part of a large document.
.Pp
An argument consisting of a single minus
.Ql Fl
is taken to be
a file name corresponding to the standard input.
.Pp
Note that inclusion can be suppressed by using
.Ql \e'
instead of
.Ql \e. ,
i.e.
.Pp
.Dl \'so /usr/lib/tmac.s
.Pp
A sample usage of
.Nm
would be
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
soelim exum?.n \&| tbl \&| nroff \-ms \&| col \&| lpr
.Ed
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl I
Add the specified directory to the search path for input files.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr colcrt 1 ,
.Xr more 1
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .
.Sh BUGS
The format of the source commands must involve no strangeness \-
exactly one blank must precede and no blanks follow the file name.
