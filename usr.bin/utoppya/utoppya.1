.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the userland interface to the
Topfield TF5000PVR range of DVB recorders (nicknamed `Toppy')
which uses the
.Xr utoppy 4
device driver.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f
Communicate with
.Ar device
instead of the default
.Pa /dev/utoppy0 .

Using the services of the
.Xr utoppy 4
driver,
.Nm
can perform the following operations, specified by the
.Ar command
operand:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm df
Display disk size and free space
.It Cm ls Op Ar directory
List the files in the specified
.Ar directory .
Default is the Toppy's root directory.
.It Cm mkdir Ao Ar directory Ac
Make the specified
.Ar directory .
You must supply the full pathname to
.Ar directory .
.It Cm rm Ao Ar pathname Ac
Delete the file or directory specified by
.Ar pathname .
.It Cm rename Ao Ar source Ac Ao Ar target Ac
Rename the file or directory specified by the
.Ar source
operand to the destination file or directory specified by the
.Ar target
operand.
.It Cm get Oo Fl prt Oc Ao Ar toppyfile Ac Oo Ar localfile Oc
Copy
.Ar toppyfile
from the Toppy to
.Ar localfile
on the local file system.
If
.Ar localfile
is omitted, the file will be copied into the current directory and will be
named using the last component of the
.Ar toppyfile
operand.
If
.Ar localfile
is
.Sq - ,
then
.Ar toppyfile
will be copied to the standard output.
.Pp
The following options are available for the
.Nm get
command:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl p
Display a progress bar.
.It Fl r
This option is useful if you wish to resume a previously interrupted
.Nm get
command.
Instead of restarting from the beginning of the file, the transfer will
resume where it left off.
.It Fl t
Enable
.Ql Turbo
mode.
This instructs the Toppy to drop everything and concentrate on transferring
the file as quickly as possible.
You will be able to watch live TV, but all other functions, including
changing channel via the remote control, will be inoperative.
.El
.It Cm put Oo Fl prt Oc Ao Ar localfile Ac Ao Ar toppyfile Ac
Copy
.Ar localfile

.Ar toppyfile
operand.

.Nm get
