.Sh NAME
.Nm eject
.Nd eject a floppy disk, cdrom or tape
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl fv
.Op Fl l | L | U
.Op Fl t Ar device-type
.Op Fl d
.Ar device
.Nm ""
.Fl n
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program ejects a medium from the specified device. It can also load a cdrom
in the drive if this operation is supported by the hardware.
The
.Ar device
argument specifies a device either by its full path name
.Po identified by a \&
.Pa /dev/
prefix
.Pc ,
or by one of the built-in nicknames.
If the medium contains a filesystem that is currently mounted,
.Nm
will attempt to unmount the filesystem before ejecting.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width xxx
.It Fl d
Deprecated.
.It Fl f
Force the eject operation without attempting to unmount any filesystems first.
.It Fl l
Load media in the drive (only supporded for the cdrom device type).
.It Fl L
Lock the media into the drive (but see
.Sx BUGS
below).
.It Fl U
Unlock the media from the drive.
.It Fl n
List the built-in nicknames on standard output.
.It Fl t Ar device-type
Specify the device type.
The argument must be one of
.Sy diskette ,
.Sy floppy ,
.Sy cdrom ,
.Sy disk ,
or
.Sy tape .
This option is necessary when ejecting a device for which no built-in
knowledge is available.
.It Fl v
Display some of the actions taken on standard output.
.El
.Pp
.Sh BUGS
Most disk drivers automatically lock the media on the first open and
unlock it on the last close, making
.Ql eject -L
almost useless, since when it closes the device, it gets unlocked
again.
