.Sh NAME
.Nm elf2ecoff
.Nd convert a NetBSD ELF-format executable to NetBSD ECOFF format
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm elf2ecoff
.Ar elf-file
.Ar ecoff-file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Reads a fully-linked ELF executable (such as a  linked kernel)
and produces an equivalent ECOFF format executable file.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility is used to convert native
.Nx
ELF binaries
to ECOFF format, for compatibility with DECstation diskless-boot
PROM code and diskless-boot servers that require ECOFF format binaries.

.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
was originally developed for
.Nx Ns Tn /pmax
by Ted Lemon
and was first distributed with the pmax port of
.Nx 1.1 .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
assumes there are no multiply-referenced symbols in the input ELF symbol
section.
It may be necessary to link with
.Fl x
to avoid duplicate symbols.
.Pp
In some environments, the GNU binutils
.Xr objcopy 1
utility may be a better solution than
.Nm .
