.Sh NAME
.Nm systat
.Nd display system statistics on a CRT
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl M Ar core
.Op Fl N Ar system
.Op Fl t Ar turns
.Op Fl w Ar wait
.Op Ar display
.Op Ar refresh-interval
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
displays various system statistics in a screen oriented fashion
using the curses screen display library,
.Xr curses 3 .
.Pp
While
.Nm
is running the screen is usually divided into two windows (an exception
is the vmstat display which uses the entire screen).
The upper window depicts the current system load average.
The information displayed in the lower window may vary, depending on
user commands.
The last line on the screen is reserved for user input and error messages.
.Pp
By default
.Nm
displays the processes getting the largest percentage of the processor
in the lower window.
Other displays show more detailed process information,
swap space usage,
disk usage statistics (a la
.Xr df 1 ) ,
disk
.Tn I/O
statistics (a la
.Xr iostat 8 ) ,
virtual memory statistics (a la
.Xr vmstat 1 ) ,
network ``mbuf'' utilization, and network connections (a la
.Xr netstat 1 ) .
.Pp
Input is interpreted at two different levels.
A ``global'' command interpreter processes all keyboard input.
If this command interpreter fails to recognize a command, the
input line is passed to a per-display command interpreter.
This allows each display to have certain display-specific commands.
.Pp
Command line options:
.Bl -tag -width "refresh_interval"
.It Fl M Ar core
Extract values associated with the name list from
.Ar core
instead of the default
.Pa /dev/mem .
.It Fl N Ar system
Extract the name list from
.Ar system
instead of the default
.Pa /netbsd .
.It Fl n
Do not resolve IP addresses into string hostnames
.Pq FQDNs
on
.Ic netstat .
It has the same effect as
.Ic numbers
subcommand in
.Ic netstat .
.It Fl w Ar wait
See
.Ar refresh-interval .
.It Fl t Ar turns
How many refreshes to show each screen in 'all' display mode.
.It Ar display
The
.Ar display
argument expects to be one of:
.Ic all ,
.Ic bufcache ,
.Ic df ,
.Ic inet.icmp ,
.Ic inet.ip ,
.Ic inet.tcp ,
.Ic inet.tcpsyn ,
.Ic inet6.ip6 ,
.Ic iostat ,
.Ic mbufs ,
.Ic netstat ,
.Ic pigs ,
.Ic ps ,
.Ic swap ,
.Ic syscall
or
.Ic vmstat .
These displays can also be requested interactively and are described in
full detail below.
.It Ar refresh-interval
The
.Ar refresh-interval
specifies the screen refresh time interval in seconds.
This is provided for backwards compatibility, and overrides the
.Ar refresh-interval
specified with the
.Fl w
flag.
.El
.Pp
Certain characters cause immediate action by
.Nm  .
These are
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Ic \&^L
Refresh the screen.
.It Ic \&^G
Print the name of the current ``display'' being shown in
the lower window and the refresh interval.
.It Ic \&^Z
Stop
.Nm  .
.It Ic \&? , Ic h
Print the names of the available displays on the command line.
.It Ic \&:
Move the cursor to the command line and interpret the input
line typed as a command.
While entering a command the current character erase, word erase,
and line kill characters may be used.
.El
.Pp
The following commands are interpreted by the ``global''
command interpreter.
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Ic help Ar key
Print the names of the available displays on the command line.
It will print long names as
.Dq Ic inet.* .
To print items under
.Dq Ic inet ,
give
.Ic inet
as
.Ar key .
.It Ic load
Print the load average over the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes
on the command line.
.It Ic stop
Stop refreshing the screen.
.It Oo Ic start Oc Oo Ar number Oc
Start (continue) refreshing the screen.
If a second, numeric, argument is provided it is interpreted as a
refresh interval in seconds.
Supplying only a number will set the refresh interval to this
value.
.It Ic quit
Exit
.Nm  .
(This may be abbreviated to
.Ic q  . )
.El
.Pp
The available displays are:
.Bl -tag -width Ic
.It Ic all
Cycle through all displays automatically.
At each display, wait some
refresh-turns, then switch to the next display.
Duration of one refresh-turn is adjustable with the
.Fl w
option, number of refresh-turns can be changed with the
.Fl t
option.
.It Ic bufcache
Display, in the lower window, statistics about the file system buffers.
Statistics for each file system that has active buffers include the number
of buffers for that file system, the number of active kilobytes in those
buffers and the total size of the buffers for that file system.
.It Ic df
Lists disk usage statistics for all filesystems,
including the available free space as well as a bar
graph indicating the used capacity.
.Pp
The following commands are specific to the
.Ic df
display:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Fl -compact
.It Cm all
Displays information for all filesystems, including
kernfs, procfs and null-mounts.

.It Ic iostat
Display, in the lower window, statistics about processor use
and disk throughput.
Statistics on processor use appear as bar graphs of the amount of
time executing in user mode (``user''), in user mode running low
priority processes (``nice''), in system mode (``system''), and
idle (``idle'').
Statistics on disk throughput show, for each drive, kilobytes of
data transferred, number of disk transactions performed, and time
spent in disk accesses in milliseconds.
This information may be displayed as bar graphs or as rows of
numbers which scroll downward.
Bar graphs are shown by default;
.Pp
The following commands are specific to the
.Ic iostat
display; the minimum unambiguous prefix may be supplied.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Fl -compact
.It Cm numbers
Show the disk
.Tn I/O

Values are
displayed in numeric columns which scroll downward.
.It Cm bars
Show the disk
.Tn I/O
statistics in bar graph form (default).
.It Cm secs
Toggle the display of time in disk activity (the default is to
not display time).
.It Cm all

.It Cm rw
Show the read and write statistics separately.
.El
.It Ic mbufs
Display, in the lower window, the number of mbufs allocated
for particular uses, i.e. data, socket structures, etc.
.It Ic netstat
Display, in the lower window, network connections.
By default, network servers awaiting requests are not displayed.
Each address is displayed in the format ``host.port'', with each
shown symbolically, when possible.
It is possible to have addresses displayed numerically,
limit the display to a set of ports, hosts, and/or protocols
(the minimum unambiguous prefix may be supplied):
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ar -compact
.It Cm all
Toggle the displaying of server processes awaiting requests (this
is the equivalent of the
.Fl a
flag to
.Ar netstat  1  ) .
.It Cm numbers
Display network addresses numerically.
.It Cm names
Display network addresses symbolically.
.It Ar protocol
Display only network connections using the indicated protocol
(currently either ``tcp'' or ``udp'').
.It Cm ignore Op Ar items
Do not display information about connections associated with
the specified hosts or ports.
Hosts and ports may be specified by name (``vangogh'', ``ftp''),
or numerically.
Host addresses use the Internet dot notation (``128.32.0.9'').
Multiple items may be specified with a single command by separating
them with spaces.
.It Cm display Op Ar items
Display information about the connections associated with the
specified hosts or ports.
As for
.Ar ignore  ,
.Op Ar items
may be names or numbers.
.It Cm show Op Ar ports\&|hosts
Show, on the command line, the currently selected protocols,
hosts, and ports.
Hosts and ports which are being ignored are prefixed with a `!'.
If
.Ar ports
or
.Ar hosts
is supplied as an argument to
.Cm show  ,
then only the requested information will be displayed.
.It Cm reset
Reset the port, host, and protocol matching mechanisms to the default
(any protocol, port, or host).
.El
.It Ic pigs
Display, in the lower window, those processes which are getting the
largest portion of the processor (the default display).
When less than 100% of the
processor is scheduled to user processes, the remaining time
is accounted to the ``idle'' process.
.It Ic ps
Display, in the lower window, the same information provided
by the command
.Xr ps 1
with the flags
.Fl aux .
.Pp
The following command is specific to the
.Ic ps
display; the minimum unambiguous prefix may be supplied.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Fl -compact
.It Cm user Ar name
Limit the list of processes displayed to those owned by user
.Ar name .
If
.Ar name
is specified as `+', processes owned by any user are displayed (default).
.El
.It Ic swap
Show information about swap space usage on all the
swap areas configured with
.Xr swapctl 8 .
The first column is the device name of the partition.
The next column is the total space available in the partition.
The
.Ar Used
column indicates the total blocks used so far;
the graph shows the percentage of space in use on each partition.
If there are more than one swap partition in use,
a total line is also shown.
Areas known to the kernel, but not in use are shown as not available.
.It Ic syscall
Show per system call statistics.
The display consists of several columns of system call name and counts.
.Pp
In order to stop entries moving around the screen too much, an infinite
response filter is applied to the values before they are sorted.
.Pp
The following commands are specific to the
.Ic syscall
display:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ar -compact
.It Ic sort Ic name
Sort display by the syscall name (default).
.It Ic sort Ic count
Sort display by the count of calls or time spent in the calls.
.It Ic sort Ic syscall
Sort display be syscall number.
.It Ic show Ic count
Show the number of times the system call has be called (default).
.It Ic show Ic time
Show the average amount of time (in arbitrary units) spent in a call of
the syscall.
.El
.It Ic vmstat
Take over the entire display and show a (rather crowded) compendium
of statistics related to virtual memory usage, process scheduling,
device interrupts, system name translation caching, disk
.Tn I/O
etc.
.Pp
The upper left quadrant of the screen shows the number
of users logged in and the load average over the last one, five,
and fifteen minute intervals.
Below this is a list of the
average number of processes (over the last refresh interval)
that are runnable (`r'), in page wait (`p'),
in disk wait other than paging (`d'), sleeping (`s').
Below the queue length listing is a numerical listing and
a bar graph showing the amount of
system (shown as `='), user (shown as `\*[Gt]'),
nice (shown as `-'), and idle time (shown as ` ').
.Pp
To the right of the process statistics is a column that
lists the average number of context switches (`Csw'),
traps (`Trp'; includes page faults), system calls (`Sys'), interrupts (`Int'),
network software interrupts (`Sof'),
page faults (`Flt').
.Pp
Below this are statistics on memory utilization.
The first row of the table reports memory usage only among
active processes, that is processes that have run in the previous
twenty seconds.
The second row reports on memory usage of all processes.
The first column reports on the number of physical pages
claimed by processes.
The second column reports the number of pages of memory and swap.
The third column gives the number of pages of free memory and swap.
.Pp
Below the memory display are statistics on name translations.
It lists the number of names translated in the previous interval,
the number and percentage of the translations that were
handled by the system wide name translation cache, and
the number and percentage of the translations that were
handled by the per process name translation cache.
.Pp
At the bottom left is the disk usage display.
It reports the number of seeks, transfers, number
of kilobyte blocks transferred per second averaged over the
refresh period of the display (by default, five seconds), and
the time spent in disk accesses.
If there are more than five disks, and the terminal window has more
than 24 lines, the disks display will be flipped so that more
of the disk statistics are visible.
.Pp
Under the date in the upper right hand quadrant are statistics
on paging and swapping activity.
The first two columns report the average number of pages
brought in and out per second over the last refresh interval
due to page faults and the paging daemon.
The third and fourth columns report the average number of pages
brought in and out per second over the last refresh interval
due to swap requests initiated by the scheduler.
The first row of the display shows the average
number of disk transfers per second over the last refresh interval;
the second row of the display shows the average
number of pages transferred per second over the last refresh interval.
.Pp
Below the paging statistics is another columns of paging data.
From top to bottom, these represent average numbers of copy on write faults
(`cow'), object cache lookups (`objlk'), object cache hits (`objht'),
pages zero filled on demand (`zfodw'), number zfod's created (`nzfod'),
percentage of zfod's used (`%zfod'), number of kernel pages (`kern'),
number of wired pages (`wire'), number of active pages (`act'), number
of inactive pages (`inact'), number of free pages (`free'), pages freed
by daemon (`daefr'), pages freed by exiting processes (`prcfr'), number
of pages reactivated from freelist (`react'), scans in page out daemon
(`scan'), revolutions of the hand (`hdrev'), and in-transit blocking page
faults (`intrn'), per second over the refresh period.
Note that the `%zfod' percentage is usually less than 100%,
however it may exceed 100% if a large number of requests
are actually used long after they were set up during a
period when no new pages are being set up.
Thus this figure is most interesting when observed over
a long time period, such as from boot time
(see below on getting such a display).
.Pp
To the left of the column of paging statistics is a breakdown
of the interrupts being handled by the system.
At the top of the list is the total interrupts per second
over the time interval.
The rest of the column breaks down the total on a device
by device basis.
Only devices that have interrupted at least once since boot time are shown.
.El
.Pp
Commands to switch between displays may be abbreviated to the
minimum unambiguous prefix; for example, ``io'' for ``iostat''.
Certain information may be discarded when the screen size is
insufficient for display.
For example, on a machine with 10 drives the
.Ic iostat
bar graph displays only 3 drives on a 24 line terminal.
When a bar graph would overflow the allotted screen space it is
truncated and the actual value is printed ``over top'' of the bar.
.Pp
The following commands are common to each display which shows
information about disk drives.
These commands are used to select a set of drives to report on,
should your system have more drives configured than can normally
be displayed on the screen.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ar -compact
.It Cm display Op Ar drives
Display information about the drives indicated.
Multiple drives may be specified, separated by spaces.
.It Cm ignore Op Ar drives
Do not display information about the drives indicated.
Multiple drives may be specified, separated by spaces.
.It Cm drives Op Ar drives
With no arguments, display a list of available drives.
With arguments, replace the list of currently displayed drives
with the ones specified.
.El
.Pp
The following commands are specific to the
.Ic inet.* ,
.Ic inet6.* ,
.Ic syscall
and
.Ic vmstat
displays; the minimum unambiguous prefix may be supplied.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ar -compact
.It Cm boot
Display cumulative statistics since the system was booted.
.It Cm run
Display statistics as a running total from the point this
command is given.
.It Cm time
Display statistics averaged over the refresh interval (the default).
.It Cm zero
Reset running statistics to zero.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/networks -compact

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
program appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .
.Sh BUGS
Consumes CPU resources and thus may skew statistics.
.Pp
Certain displays presume a minimum of 80 characters per line.
.Pp
The
.Ic vmstat
display looks out of place because it is (it was added in as
a separate display from what used to be a different program).
