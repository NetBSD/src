.Sh NAME
.Nm kdump
.Nd display kernel trace data
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dlNnRTx
.Op Fl e Ar emulation
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl m Ar maxdata
.Op Fl p Ar pid
.Op Fl t Ar trstr
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
displays the kernel trace files produced with
.Xr ktrace 1
in human readable format.
The file
.Pa ktrace.out
in the current directory is displayed, unless either the
.Fl f
option is used, or a file name is supplied as the last argument.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl d
Display all numbers in decimal.
.It Fl e Ar emulation
If an emulation of a process is unknown,
interpret system call maps assuming the named emulation instead of
default "netbsd".
.It Fl f Ar file
Display the specified file instead of
.Pa ktrace.out .
.It Fl l
Loop reading the trace file, once the end-of-file is reached, waiting for
more data.
.It Fl m Ar maxdata
Display at most
.Ar maxdata
bytes when decoding
.Tn I/O .
.It Fl N
Suppress system call number-to-name translation.
.It Fl n
Suppress ad hoc translations.
Normally
.Nm
tries to decode many system calls into a more human readable format.
For example,
.Xr ioctl 2
values are replaced with the macro name and
.Va errno
values are replaced with the
.Xr strerror 3
string.
Suppressing this feature yields a more consistent output format and is
easily amenable to further processing.
.It Fl p Ar pid
Only display records from the trace file that are for the indicated pid.
.It Fl R
Display relative timestamps (time since previous entry).
.It Fl T
Display absolute timestamps for each entry (seconds since epoch).
.It Fl t Ar trstr
Restrict display to the specified set of kernel trace points.
The default is to display everything in the file.
See the
.Fl t
option of
.Xr ktrace 1 .
.It Fl x
Display GIO data in hex and ascii instead of
.Xr vis 3
format.
