.Nd configure default audio device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Cm list
.Op Ar index
.Nm
.Cm default

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility helps maintaining the audio and mixer device symlinks.
.Pp
Run with
.Dq Cm list ,
it lists the available audio devices and shows the currently selected
default audio device.
.Pp
Run with
.Dq Cm set ,
it sets the hardware format.
The
.Ar direction
is represented by either of 'p' (playback) or 'r' (record), or both of them.
This indicates the direction you want to set.
The remaining parameters
.Ar encoding ,
.Ar precision ,
.Ar channels ,
and
.Ar sample_rate
indicate the hardware format you want to set.
These parameters must be selected from the candidates displayed by
.Nm
.Cm list .
.Pp
Called with
.Dq Cm test ,
it plays a tone of 2 seconds for each channel of the device with the index
.Ar index .
Called with
.Dq Cm default ,
it sets the default audio device to the one with the index
.Ar index .
.Pp
.Nm
needs access to
.Pa /dev/drvctl
and write access to
.Pa /dev
(when used with
.Dq Cm default )
to work.
.Sh FILES
