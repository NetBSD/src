.Nd Bluetooth Headset utility
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl c Ar command
.Op Fl m Ar mixer
.Op Fl p Ar file
.Op Fl s Ar channel
.Nm
.Op Fl h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to access a Bluetooth Headset with the
.Xr btsco 4
audio device.
It opens the
.Xr mixer 4
device and creates the control connection
to the headset, then conducts volume settings each way.
When
.Nm
receives a
.Dv SIGUSR1
signal, it will start sending RING codes to the headset until the headset
button is pressed or a
.Dv SIGUSR2
signal is received.
If the headset is ringing and
.Nm
receives a button press notification, the specified
.Ar command
(if any) is executed.
.Pp
When the server channel is specified with the
.Fl s
option, instead of opening the control connection,
.Nm
will listen on the
.Ar channel
for incoming connections from the Headset and register as Headset Audio
Gateway with the local SDP server.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c Ar command
Specify an optional command to be executed when the headset responds to
ringing with a button press event.
This defaults to the contents of the
.Dv BTHSET_COMMAND
environment variable, if set.
.It Fl h
Print usage message.
.It Fl m Ar mixer
Specify the path to the mixer device.
This defaults to the contents of the
.Dv BTHSET_MIXER
environment variable, or
.Pa /dev/mixer
if not set.
.It Fl p Ar file
Write the PID to
.Ar file
so that other programs can find us later.
This defaults to the contents of the
.Dv BTHSET_PIDFILE
environment variable, if set.
.It Fl s Ar channel
Register with the local SDP server as a Headset Audio Gateway and listen for
connections on the given RFCOMM server channel.
.It Fl v
