.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm pgrep
command searches the process table on the running system and prints the
process IDs of all processes that match the criteria given on the command
line.
.Pp
The
.Nm pkill
command searches the process table on the running system and signals all
processes that match the criteria given on the command line.
.Pp
The
.Nm prenice
command searches the process table on the running system and sets the
priority of all processes that match the criteria given on the command line.
.Pp
By default, matching applies to any substring of the command name
.Pq Va argv[0] ,
but options may be used to change this.
Patterns are specified using extended regular expressions (see
.Xr re_format 7 ) .
.Pp
The following options are available for
.Nm pkill
and
.Nm pgrep :
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxx
.It Fl d Ar delim
Specify a delimiter to be printed between each process ID.
The default is a newline.
This option can only be used with the
.Nm pgrep
command.
.It Fl f
Match against full argument lists.
The default is to match against process names.
.It Fl G Ar gid
Restrict matches to processes with a real group ID in the comma-separated
list
.Ar gid .
.It Fl g Ar pgrp
Restrict matches to processes with a process group ID in the comma-separated
list
.Ar pgrp .
The value zero is taken to mean the process group ID of the running
.Nm pgrep
or
.Nm pkill
command.
.It Fl i
Ignore case distinctions in both the process table and the supplied pattern.
.It Fl l
Long output.
Print the process name in addition to the process ID for each matching
process.
If used in conjunction with
.Fl f ,
print the process ID and the full argument list for each matching process.
.It Fl n
Match only the most recently created process, if any.
.It Fl P Ar ppid
Restrict matches to processes with a parent process ID in the
comma-separated list
.Ar ppid .
.It Fl s Ar sid
Restrict matches to processes with a session ID in the comma-separated
list
.Ar sid .
The value zero is taken to mean the session ID of the running
.Nm pgrep
or
.Nm pkill
command.
.It Fl t Ar tty
Restrict matches to processes associated with a terminal in the
comma-separated list
.Ar tty .
Terminal names may be specified as a fully qualified path, in the form
.Sq ttyXX ,
or
.Sq pts/N ,
(where
.Ar XX
is any pair of letters, and
.Ar N
is a number),
or the shortened forms
.Sq XX
or
.Sq N .
A single dash
.Pq Sq -
matches processes not associated with a terminal.
.It Fl U Ar uid
Restrict matches to processes with a real user ID in the comma-separated
list
.Ar uid .
.It Fl u Ar euid
Restrict matches to processes with an effective user ID in the
comma-separated list
.Ar euid .
.It Fl v
Reverse the sense of the matching; display processes that do not match the
given criteria.
.It Fl x
Require an exact match of the process name, or argument list if
.Fl f
is given.
The default is to match any substring.
.It Fl signal
A non-negative decimal number or symbolic signal name specifying the signal
to be sent instead of the default TERM.
This option is valid only when given as the first argument to
.Nm pkill .
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl l
flag is also available for
.Nm prenice .
.Pp
Note that a running
.Nm pgrep ,
.Nm pkill ,
or
.Nm prenice
process will never consider itself or system processes (kernel threads) as
a potential match.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm pgrep ,
.Nm pkill ,
and
.Nm prenice
return one of the following values upon exit:
.Bl -tag -width foo
.It 0
One or more processes were matched.
.It 1
No processes were matched.
.It 2
Invalid options were specified on the command line.
.It 3
An internal error occurred.

.Sh HISTORY
.Nm pkill
and
.Nm pgrep
first appeared in
.Nx 1.6 .
They are modelled after utilities of the same name that appeared in Sun
Solaris 7.
.Pp
.Nm prenice
was introduced in
.Nx 6.0 .
