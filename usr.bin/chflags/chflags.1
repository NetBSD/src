.Nm chflags
.Nd change file flags
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Oo
.Fl R
.Op Fl H | Fl L | Fl P
.Oc
.Op Fl h
.Ar flags
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility modifies the file flags of the listed files
as specified by the
.Ar flags
operand.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl H
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, symbolic links on the command line are followed.
(Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal are not followed.)
.It Fl L
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.
.It Fl P
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.
.It Fl R
Change the file flags for the file hierarchies rooted
in the
.Ar files
instead of just the
.Ar files
themselves.
.It Fl h
If the
.Ar file
or a file encountered during directory traversal is a symbolic link,
the file flags of the link itself is changed.
.El
.Pp
Flags are a comma separated list of keywords.
The following keywords are currently defined:
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
arch	set the archived flag (super-user only)
opaque	set the opaque flag (owner or super-user only)
nodump	set the nodump flag (owner or super-user only)
sappnd	set the system append-only flag (super-user only)
schg	set the system immutable flag (super-user only)
uappnd	set the user append-only flag (owner or super-user only)
uchg	set the user immutable flag (owner or super-user only)
.Ed
.Pp
Putting the letters
.Dq no
before an option causes the flag to be turned off.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
nouchg	the immutable bit should be cleared
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fl H ,
.Fl L
and
.Fl P
options are ignored unless the
.Fl R
option is specified.
In addition, these options override each other and the
command's actions are determined by the last one specified.
.Pp
The
.Fl o
option
of
.Xr ls 1
is used to display the flags.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and \*[Gt]0 if an error occurs.
.Pp
The kernel does not allow the flags on block and character
devices to be changed except by the super-user.
