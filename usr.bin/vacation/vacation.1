.Op Fl t Ar interval

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
returns a message to the sender of a message telling them that you
are currently not reading your mail.
The intended use is in a
.Pa .forward
file.
For example, your
.Pa .forward
file might have:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
\eeric, "|/usr/bin/vacation -a allman eric"
.Ed
which would send messages to you (assuming your login name was eric) and
reply to any messages for
.Dq eric
or
.Dq allman .
.Pp
Available options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a Ar alias
Handle messages for
.Ar alias
in the same manner as those received for the user's
login name.
.It Fl d
Turn debugging on; don't send an actual message, but print it on stdout.
.It Fl f Ar database_file
Use the specified
.Ar database_file
prefix and append
.Dv \.db
to it instead of
.Dv $HOME/.vacation.db .
.It Fl F Ar F|R|S
Make
.Nm
additionally look in From: (F), Return-Path: (R), or Sender: (S) headers
to determine the From: field.
.It Fl i
.It Fl I
Initialize the vacation database files.
It should be used before you modify your
.Pa .forward
file.
.It Fl j
Do not check if the recipient is present in the
.Dv To:
or
.Dv Cc:
lines.
Usage of this option is strongly discouraged because it will result in
.Nm
replying to mailing lists or other inappropriate places (e.g., messages that
you have been
.Dv Bcc
to).
.It Fl m Ar message_file
Use
.Ar message_file
instead of
.Dv $HOME/.vacation.msg .
.It Fl s Ar sender
Reply to
.Ar sender
instead of the value read from the message.
.It Fl r Ar interval
.It Fl t Ar interval
Set the reply interval to
.Ar interval
days.
If the
.Ar interval
number is followed by
.Dv w ,
.Dv d ,
.Dv h ,
.Dv m ,
or
.Dv s
then the number is interpreted as weeks, days, hours, minutes, or seconds
respectively.
The default
.Ar interval
is one week.
An
.Ar interval
of
.Dq 0
means that
a reply is sent to each message, and an interval of
.Dq Li infinite
(actually, any non-numeric character) will never send more than
one reply.
It should be noted that intervals of
.Dq Li \&0
are quite
dangerous, as it allows mailers to get into
.Dq I am on vacation
loops.
.It Fl T Ar A|D
Make
.Nm
additionally look in Apparently-To: (A) or Delivered-To: (D) headers
to determine the To: field.
.El
.Pp
No message will be sent unless
.Ar login
(or an
.Ar alias
supplied using the
.Fl a
option) is part of either the
.Dq To:
or
.Dq Cc:
headers of the mail.
No messages from
.Dq ???-REQUEST ,
.Dq Postmaster ,
.Dq Tn UUCP ,
.Dq MAILER ,
or
.Dq MAILER-DAEMON
will be replied to (where these strings are
case insensitive) nor is a notification sent if a
.Dq Precedence: bulk
.Dq Precedence: list
or
.Dq Precedence: junk
line is included in the mail headers.
The people who have sent you messages are maintained as a
.Xr db 3
database in the file
.Pa .vacation.db
in your home directory.
.Pp
.Nm
expects a file
.Pa .vacation.msg ,
in your home directory, containing a message to be sent back to each
sender.
It should be an entire message (including headers).
If the message contains the string
.Dv $SUBJECT
then it will will be replaced with the subject of the original message.
For example, it might contain:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
From: eric@CS.Berkeley.EDU (Eric Allman)
Subject: I am on vacation
Delivered-By-The-Graces-Of: The Vacation program
Precedence: bulk

I am on vacation until July 22.
Your mail regarding "$SUBJECT" will be read when I return.
If you have something urgent, please contact Keith Bostic
\*[Lt]bostic@CS.Berkeley.EDU\*[Gt].
--eric
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm
reads the first line from the standard input for a
.Ux
.Dq From
line to determine the sender.
.Xr sendmail 8
includes this
.Dq From
line automatically.
.Pp
Fatal errors, such as calling
.Nm
with incorrect arguments, or with non-existent
.Ar login Ns Ar s ,
are logged in the system log file, using
.Xr syslog 3 .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "vacation.dirxxx" -compact

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .
.Sh BUGS
Adding
.Fl t Ar A
or
.Fl t Ar D
should only be done for misconfigured or non-compliant MTAs.
Doing so may auto-respond to messages that were not supposed to be replied to.
