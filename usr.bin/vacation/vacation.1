.Sh NAME
.Nm vacation
.Nd return
.Dq I am not here
indication
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Fl i
.Op Fl f Ar F|R|S
.Op Fl r Ar interval
.Op Fl t Ar A|D
.Nm
.Op Fl a Ar alias
.Op Fl f Ar F|R|S
.Op Fl t Ar A|D
.Ar login
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
returns a message to the sender of a message telling them that you
are currently not reading your mail.
The intended use is in a
.Pa .forward
file.
For example, your
.Pa .forward
file might have:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
\eeric, "|/usr/bin/vacation -a allman eric"
.Ed
which would send messages to you (assuming your login name was eric) and
reply to any messages for
.Dq eric
or
.Dq allman .
.Pp
Available options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a Ar alias
Handle messages for
.Ar alias
in the same manner as those received for the user's
login name.
.It Fl f Ar F|R|S
Make
.Nm
additionally look in From: (F), Return-Path: (R), or Sender: (S) headers
to determine the From: field.
.It Fl i
Initialize the vacation database files.
It should be used before you modify your
.Pa .forward
file.
.It Fl r
Set the reply interval to
.Ar interval
days.
The default is one week.
An interval of
.Dq 0
means that
a reply is sent to each message, and an interval of
.Dq Li infinite
(actually, any non-numeric character) will never send more than
one reply.
It should be noted that intervals of
.Dq Li \&0
are quite
dangerous, as it allows mailers to get into
.Dq I am on vacation
loops.
.It Fl t Ar A|D
Make
.Nm
additionally look in Apparently-To: (A) or Delivered-To: (D) headers
to determine the To: field.
.El
.Pp
No message will be sent unless
.Ar login
(or an
.Ar alias
supplied using the
.Fl a
option) is part of either the
.Dq To:
or
.Dq Cc:
headers of the mail.
No messages from
.Dq ???-REQUEST ,
.Dq Postmaster ,
.Dq Tn UUCP ,
.Dq MAILER ,
or
.Dq MAILER-DAEMON
will be replied to (where these strings are
case insensitive) nor is a notification sent if a
.Dq Precedence: bulk
.Dq Precedence: list
or
.Dq Precedence: junk
line is included in the mail headers.
The people who have sent you messages are maintained as a
.Xr db 3
database in the file
.Pa .vacation.db
in your home directory.
.Pp
.Nm
expects a file
.Pa .vacation.msg ,
in your home directory, containing a message to be sent back to each
sender.
It should be an entire message (including headers).
For example, it might contain:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
From: eric@CS.Berkeley.EDU (Eric Allman)
Subject: I am on vacation
Delivered-By-The-Graces-Of: The Vacation program
Precedence: bulk

I am on vacation until July 22.  If you have something urgent,
please contact Keith Bostic \*[Lt]bostic@CS.Berkeley.EDU\*[Gt].
--eric
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm
reads the first line from the standard input for a
.Ux
.Dq From
line to determine the sender.
.Xr sendmail 8
includes this
.Dq From
line automatically.
.Pp
Fatal errors, such as calling
.Nm
with incorrect arguments, or with non-existent
.Ar login Ns Ar s ,
are logged in the system log file, using
.Xr syslog 3 .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "vacation.dirxxx" -compact

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .
.Sh BUGS
Adding
.Fl t Ar A
or
.Fl t Ar D
should only be done for misconfigured or non-compliant MTA's.
Doing so may auto-respond to messages that were not supposed to be replied to.
