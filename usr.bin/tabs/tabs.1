.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility displays a series of characters that first clears the hardware terminal
tab settings and then initializes the tab stops at the specified positions
and optionally adjusts the margin.
.Pp
The phrase "tab-stop position N" means that, from the start of a line of
output, tabbing to position N shall cause the next character output to be in
the (N+1)th column on that line.
.Pp
The following options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl Ar n
Specifies repetitive tab stops separated by a uniform number of columns,
.Ar n ,
where
.Ar n
is a single digit decimal number.
The default usage of
.Nm
with no arguments is equivalent to
.Nm
.Fl 8 .
When
.Fl 0
is used, the tab stops are cleared and no new ones set.
.It Fl a
Assembler, applicable to some mainframes.
Equivalent to
.Nm

.It Fl a2

.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The
.Ev COLUMNS
and
.Ev TERM
environment variables affect the execution of
.Nm
as described in
.Xr environ 7 .
.Pp
The
.Fl T
option overrides
.Ev TERM .
If neither
.Ev TERM
nor the
.Fl T
option are present,
.Nm
will fail.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility conforms to
.St -p1003.1 .
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
utility first appeared in PWB UNIX.
This implementation was introduced in
.Nx 6.0 .
