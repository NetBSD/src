.Sh NAME
.Nm rfcomm_sppd
.Nd RFCOMM Serial Port Profile daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d Ar device
.Op Fl m Ar mode
.Op Fl p Ar psm
.Op Fl s Ar service
.Op Fl t Ar tty
.Brq Fl a Ar address | Op Fl c Ar channel
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is a Serial Port Profile daemon, providing serial access over
an RFCOMM connection to a remote device.
.Nm
can work in client or server mode.
.Pp
In client mode,
.Nm
initiates an RFCOMM connection to the
.Ar service
at the remote
.Ar address .
.Pp
In server mode,
.Nm
registers the
.Ar service
with the local SDP server and listens on the specified RFCOMM
.Ar channel
for an incoming connection, or the first unused channel if none
was given.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl c Ar channel"
.It Fl a Ar address
Client mode.
Specify the address of the remote RFCOMM device.
The address can be specified as BD_ADDR or name.
If given as a name, then the
.Nm
utility will attempt to resolve the name via
.Xr bt_gethostbyname 3 .
.It Fl c Ar channel
In server mode, specify the RFCOMM channel number to listen on.
.Nm
will register the service with the local
.Xr sdpd 8
daemon.
Note that registering services with
.Xr sdpd 8
is a privileged operation.
.It Fl d Ar device
Use the local device with the specified address.
The device can be specified by BD_ADDR or device name.
See
.Xr btconfig 8
for a list of available devices.
If no
.Ar device
is specified, the connection will be set up on a system determined device.
.It Fl m Ar mode
Set connection link mode.
Supported modes are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width encrypt -offset xx
.It auth
require devices be paired.
.It encrypt
auth, plus enable encryption.
.It secure
encryption, plus change of link key.
.El
.It Fl p Ar psm
Specify the
.Qq Protocol/Service Multiplexer
value to be used for the RFCOMM protocol.
In client mode where Service Discovery is being used, this value
will be ignored.
.It Fl s Ar service
Name of service class to connect to or register.
If no
.Ar service
is given, the default
.Qq Serial Port
service class will be used.
Known service classes are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width DUN -offset xx
.It DUN
Dialup Networking
.It LAN
LAN access using PPP
.It SP
Serial Port
.El
.Pp
In client mode, the service class may be given as a channel number, for instances
where the remote device does not provide Service Discovery.
.It Fl t Ar tty
Slave pseudo tty name.
If this option is given,
.Nm
will detach from the controlling process after the Bluetooth connection is
made, and operate over the named
.Xr pty 4
pair.
Otherwise, stdin/stdout will be used.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /dev/tty[p-sP-S][0-9a-v]" -compact
.It Pa /dev/pty[p-sP-S][0-9a-v]
master pseudo terminals
.It Pa /dev/tty[p-sP-S][0-9a-v]
slave pseudo terminals
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl rfcomm_sppd -a 00:01:02:03:04:05 -s 1 -t /dev/ttyp1
.Pp
Will open an RFCOMM connection to the server at
.Li 00:01:02:03:04:05
on channel
.Li 1 .
Once the connection has been established,
.Nm
will detach and
.Pa /dev/ttyp1
can be used to communicate with the remote serial port on the
server, e.g. with the use of
.Pp
.Dl cu -l /dev/ttyp1
.Pp
In order to use
.Nm
to automatically create a secured link for
.Xr pppd 8 ,
use
.Dl pty Qo rfcomm_sppd -a 00:01:02:03:04:05 -s DUN -m secure Qc
.Pp
in your
.Xr pppd 8
configuration file.
