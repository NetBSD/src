.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm

.Tn NIS
database specified by
.Ar mapname ,
which may be a map name or a map nickname.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b Ar num_retry
Do not wait infinite time for the ypserver to come up.
Retry only the specified number of times.
See

for explanation.
The valid range is limited from 0 to 65535 by this program.
.It Fl d Ar domainname
Specify a domain other than the default domain.
.It Fl k
Print the map key followed by a colon, before printing key value.
This option is useful with maps in which the values are null or the key
is not part of the value.
.It Fl t
Inhibit translation of map nicknames
to their corresponding map names.
.It Fl x
Display the map nickname table, found in
.Pa /var/yp/nicknames .
A built-in default translation table is used if
.Pa /var/yp/nicknames
does not exist (see
.Xr nicknames 5
for details).
.It Fl z
Append a NUL character at the end of the key when doing the lookup.
This is useful for mail.aliases maps, which include a trailing NUL in
the keys.
