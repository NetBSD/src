.Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program converts the sequencer events read on
.Ar sequencerdev
to the named MIDI SMF output.
If the file name is \-, output will go to the standard output.
By default, timing for events begins with the first event.
The
.Fl o
flag may be used to start timing events at the process start up.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width XnXnotesperbeatX
.It Fl a
Append to the specified file, rather than overwriting.
.It Fl B Ar buffersize
Set the sequencer device read buffer size to
.Ar buffersize .
The default value is 32768 bytes.
.It Fl c Ar channels
Sets the filter list of channels to
.Ar channels ,
which is a comma separated list of channels to filter in.
.It Fl D
Enable debug log.
.It Fl d Ar devices
Sets the filter list of devices to
.Ar devices ,
which is a comma separated list of devices to filter in.
.It Fl f Ar sequencerdev
Sets the sequencer device to use to
.Ar sequencerdev .
The default is
.Pa /dev/music .
.It Fl h
Print a help message.
.It Fl n Ar notesperbeat
Sets the MIDI notes (clocks) per beat to
.Ar notesperbeat .
.It Fl o

the first event.
.It Fl q
Be quiet.
.It Fl R Ar roundbeats
Round timings to
.Ar roundbeats
of a note.
Output will always be aligned to this many beats.
.It Fl r Ar raw_output
