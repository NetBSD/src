.Sh NAME
.Nm midirecord
.Nd record midi files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl aDfhoqV
.Op Fl B Ar buffersize
.Op Fl c Ar channels
.Op Fl d Ar devices
.Op Fl f Ar sequencerdev
.Op Fl n Ar notesperbeat
.Op Fl R Ar roundbeats
.Op Fl r Ar raw_output
.Op Fl T Ar tempo
.Op Fl t Ar time
.Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program converts the sequencer events read on
.Ar sequencerdev
to the named MIDI SMF output.
If the file name is \-, output will go to the standard output.
By default, timing for events begins with the first event.
The
.Fl o
flag may be used to start timing events at the process start up.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width XnXnotesperbeatX
.It Fl a
Append to the specified file, rather than overwriting.
.It Fl B Ar buffersize
Set the sequencer device read buffer size to
.Ar buffersize .
The default value is 32768 bytes.
.It Fl c Ar channels
Sets the filter list of channels to
.Ar channels ,
which is a comma separated list of channels to filter in.
.It Fl D
Enable debug log.
.It Fl d Ar devices
Sets the filter list of devices to
.Ar devices ,
which is a comma separated list of devices to filter in.
.It Fl f Ar sequencerdev
Sets the sequencer device to use to
.Ar sequencerdev .
The default is
.Pa /dev/music .
.It Fl h
Print a help message.
.It Fl n Ar notesperbeat
Sets the MIDI notes (clocks) per beat to
.Ar notesperbeat .
.It Fl o
Start the relative timer at process start up instead of at
the first event.
.It Fl q
Be quiet.
.It Fl R Ar roundbeats
Round timings to
.Ar roundbeats
of a note.
Output will always be aligned to this many beats.
.It Fl r Ar raw_output
Create the raw output of the sequencer device in
.Ar raw_output .
.It Fl T Ar tempo
Set the tempo for the recording to
.Ar tempo .
.It Fl t Ar time
Sets the maximum amount of time to record.
Format is [hh:]mm:ss[.dddddd].
.It Fl V
Be verbose.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width MIDIDEVICE
.It Ev MIDIDEVICE
the midi device to be used.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
You can use
.Nm
to observe activity on a MIDI bus using the
.Fl D
and
.Fl V
options and learn about device-specific MIDI messages.
.Pp
For instance, to determine the MIDI messages needed to switch to ARP mode
on a Korg minilogue XD synthesizer, which does not document any control
change or non-registered parameter numbers for this function but does
document that ARP is part of the
.Dq VOICE TYPE MODE ,
parameter these messages were seen:
.Pp
.Dl midi_event_chn_common_to_output:444: MIDI_CTL_CHANGE: channel 0 ctrl 62 val 10
.Dl midi_event_chn_common_to_output:444: MIDI_CTL_CHANGE: channel 0 ctrl 6 val 1
.Pp
which shows that CC#62 (hexadecimal) was set to value 10 (also
hexadecimal), and that CC#6 was set to value 1.
As CC#62 is also the least significant byte of the non-registered
parameter number, we can guess that NRPN 0,62 controls the
.Dq VOICE MODE TYPE
parameter documented in the synthesizer manual, and that the value 1
set to CC#6 (Control Data Entry MSB) turns on ARP mode.
For completeness, setting both CC#62 and CC#63 for the parameter
number, as well as CC#6 and CC#26 (Control Data Entry MSB) to 0
provides a complete NRPN control message.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
program was first seen in
.Nx 7 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
program was written by
.An Matthew R. Green Aq Mt mrg@eterna.com.au .
.Sh BUGS
SYSEX, LOCAL and FULLSIZE messages are not currently handled, but the
.Nx
.Xr sequencer 4
device does not generate them.
.Pp
.Nm
will hang after the timeout waiting for the very next message before
it will exit and finish writing the file.
