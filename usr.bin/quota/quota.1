.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
displays users' disk usage and limits.
By default only the user quotas are printed.
.Pp
Options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl h
Numbers are displayed in a human readable format.
.It Fl g
Print group quotas for the group
of which the user is a member.
The optional
.Fl u
flag is equivalent to the default.
.It Fl v
.Nm
will display quotas on filesystems
where no storage is allocated.
.It Fl q
Print a more terse message,
containing only information
on filesystems where usage is over quota.
.It Fl d
Query the kernel for default user or group quota instead of a specific
user or group
.It Fl D
Debug: print plist sent to and received from kernel.
.El
.Pp
Specifying both
.Fl g
and
.Fl u
displays both the user quotas and the group quotas (for
the user).
.Pp
Only the super-user may use the
.Fl u
flag and the optional
.Ar user
argument to view the limits of other users.
Non-super-users can use the
.Fl g
flag and optional
.Ar group
argument to view only the limits of groups of which they are members.
.Pp
Only the super-user may use the
.Fl d
flag.
.Pp
The
.Fl q
flag takes precedence over the
.Fl v
flag.
.Pp
.Nm
tries to report the quotas of all mounted filesystems.
If the filesystem is mounted via
.Em NFS
it will attempt to contact the
.Xr rpc.rquotad 8
daemon on the
.Em NFS
server.
If
.Nm
exits with a non-zero status, one or more filesystems
are over quota.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width quota.group -compact
.It Pa quota.user
located at the filesystem root with user quotas
.It Pa quota.group
located at the filesystem root with group quotas
.It Pa /etc/fstab
to find filesystem names and locations
