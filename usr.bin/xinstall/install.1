.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file(s) are moved (copied if the
.Fl c
option is specified, or linked if the
.Fl l
option is specified) to the target file or directory.
If the destination is a directory, then the
.Ar file
is moved into
.Ar directory
with its original filename.
If the target file already exists, it is 
either renamed to
.Ar file.old
if the 
.Fl b
option is given
or overwritten
if permissions allow, An alternate backup suffix may be specified via the
.Fl B
option's argument.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
Backup any existing files before overwriting them by renaming
them to 
.Ar file.old . See
.Fl B
for specifying a different backup suffix.
.It Fl B Ar suffix
Use 
.Ar suffix
as the backup suffix if 
.Fl b
is given. If
.Ar suffix
contains a '%' sign, a numbered backup will be performed, and the
%-pattern will be expanded using
.Xr sprintf 3 ,
given an integer counter as the backup number. 
The counter used starts from 0, and the first available name resulting
from the expansion is used. 
.It Fl c
Copy the file.
This flag turns off the default behavior of
.Nm
where it deletes the original file after creating the target.
.It Fl f
Specify the target's file flags.
(See
.Xr chflags 1
for a list of possible flags and their meanings.)
.It Fl g
Specify a group.
.It Fl m
Specify an alternative mode.
The default mode is set to rwxr-xr-x (0755).
The specified mode may be either an octal or symbolic value; see
.Xr chmod  1
for a description of possible mode values.
.It Fl l Ar linkflags
Instead of copying the file make a link to the source. The type of the
link is determined by the 
.Ar linkflags
argument. Valid
.Ar linkflags
are:
.Ar a
(absolute),
.Ar r
(relative),
.Ar h
(hard),
.Ar s
(symbolic),
.Ar m
(mixed). Absolute and relative have effect only for symbolic links. Mixed links
are hard links for files on the same filesystem, symbolic otherwise.
.It Fl o
Specify an owner.
.It Fl p
Preserve the source files access and modification times.
.It Fl r
Install to a temporary file and then rename the file to its final destination
name. This can be used for precious files, to avoid truncation of the original
when error conditions (filesystem full etc.) occur.
.It Fl s
.Nm
exec's the command
.Xr strip  1
to strip binaries so that install can be portable over a large
number of systems and binary types.  If the environment variable
.Ev STRIP
is set, it is used as the
.Xr strip 1
program.
.It Fl S Ar stripflags
.Nm
passes
.Ar stripflags
as option arguments to
.Xr strip  1 .
When -S is used,
.Xr strip  1
is invoked via the
.Xr sh  1
shell, allowing a single -S argument be to specified to
.Nm
which the shell can then tokenize. Normally,
.Nm
invokes
.Xr strip  1
directly. This flag implies -s.
.It Fl d
Create directories. 
Missing parent directories are created as required.
.It Fl U
Indicate that install is running unprivileged, and that it should not
try to change the owner or the group of the destination.
A future version of this file may log the owner/group information
elsewhere; currently, it's just discarded.
.El
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
preserves all file flags, with the exception of the ``nodump'' flag.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility attempts to prevent moving a file onto itself.
.Pp
Installing
.Pa /dev/null
creates an empty file.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success,
and >0 if an error occurs.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Ev STRIP
The program used to strip installed binaries when the
.Fl s
option is used.  If unspecified,
.Pa /usr/bin/strip
is used.
