.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file(s) are moved (copied if the
.Fl c
option is specified, or linked if the
.Fl l
option is specified) to the target file or directory.
If the destination is a directory, then the
.Ar file
is moved into
.Ar directory
with its original filename.
If the target file already exists, it is 
either renamed to
.Ar file.old
if the 
.Fl b
option is given
or overwritten
if permissions allow, An alternate backup suffix may be specified via the
.Fl B
option's argument.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
Backup any existing files before overwriting them by renaming
them to 
.Ar file.old . See
.Fl B
for specifying a different backup suffix.
.It Fl B Ar suffix
Use 
.Ar suffix
as the backup suffix if 
.Fl b
is given.
.It Fl c
Copy the file.
This flag turns off the default behavior of
.Nm
where it deletes the original file after creating the target.
.It Fl f
Specify the target's file flags.
(See
.Xr chflags 1
for a list of possible flags and their meanings.)
.It Fl g
Specify a group.
.It Fl m
Specify an alternative mode.
The default mode is set to rwxr-xr-x (0755).
The specified mode may be either an octal or symbolic value; see
.Xr chmod  1
for a description of possible mode values.
.It Fl l Ar linkflags
Instead of copying the file make a link to the source. The type of the
link is determined by the 
.Ar linkflags
argument. Valid
.Ar linkflags
are:
.Ar a
(absolute),
.Ar r
(relative),
.Ar h
(hard),
.Ar s
(symbolic),
.Ar m
(mixed). Absolute and relative have effect only for symbolic links. Mixed links
are hard links for files on the same filesystem, symbolic otherwise.
.It Fl o
Specify an owner.
.It Fl p
Preserve the source files access and modification times.
.It Fl s
.Nm
exec's the command
.Xr strip  1
to strip binaries so that install can be portable over a large
number of systems and binary types.  If the environment variable
.Ev STRIP
is set, it is used as the
.Xr strip 1
program.
.It Fl S Ar stripflags
.Nm
passes
.Ar stripflags
as option arguments to
.Xr strip  1 .
When -S is used,
.Xr strip  1
is invoked via the
.Xr sh  1
shell, allowing a single -S argument be to specified to
.Nm
which the shell can then tokenize. Normally,
.Nm
invokes
.Xr strip  1
directly. This flag implies -s.
.It Fl d
Create directories. 
Missing parent directories are created as required.
.El
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
preserves all file flags, with the exception of the ``nodump'' flag.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility attempts to prevent moving a file onto itself.
.Pp
Installing
.Pa /dev/null
creates an empty file.
.Pp
Upon successful completion a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of 1 is returned.
