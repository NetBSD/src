.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility writes to the standard output three whitespace separated
fields for each input file.
These fields are a checksum
.Tn CRC ,
the total number of octets in the file and the file name.
If no file name is specified, the standard input is used and no file name
is written.
.Pp
The
.Nm sum
utility is identical to the
.Nm
utility, except that it defaults to using historic algorithm 1, as
described below.
It is provided for compatibility only.
.Pp
The
.Nm md5
utility takes as input a message of arbitrary length and produces
as output a 128-bit
.Dq fingerprint
or
.Dq message digest
of the input.
It is conjectured that it is computationally infeasible
to product two messages having the same message digest, or to produce
any message having a given prespecified target message digest.
The
MD5 algorithm is intended for digital signature applications, where
a large file must be
.Dq compressed
in a secure manner before being encrypted with a private (secret)
key under a public-key encryption system such as
.Pa RSA .
.Pp
The
.Nm md2
and
.Nm md4
utilities behave in exactly the same manner as
.Nm md5
but use different algorithms.
.Pp
The
.Nm sha1
and
.Nm rmd160
utilities also produce message digests, however the output from these
two programs is 160 bits in length, as opposed to 128.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl 1
Use the SHA1 algorithm rather than the default one.
.It Fl 2
Use the MD2 algorithm rather than the default one.
.It Fl 4
Use the MD4 algorithm rather than the default one.
.It Fl m | 5
Use the MD5 algorithm rather than the default one.
.It Fl 6
Use the RMD160 algorithm rather than the default one.
.It Fl o
Use historic algorithms instead of the (superior) default one.
.Pp
Algorithm 1 is the algorithm used by historic
.Bx
systems as the
.Xr sum 1
algorithm and by historic
.At V
systems as the
.Xr sum 1
algorithm when using the
.Fl r
option.
This is a 16-bit checksum, with a right rotation before each addition;
overflow is discarded.
.Pp
Algorithm 2 is the algorithm used by historic
.At V
systems as the
default
.Xr sum 1
algorithm.
This is a 32-bit checksum, and is defined as follows:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
s = sum of all bytes;
r = s % 2^16 + (s % 2^32) / 2^16;
cksum = (r % 2^16) + r / 2^16;
.Ed
.Pp
Both algorithm 1 and 2 write to the standard output the same fields as
the default algorithm except that the size of the file in bytes is
replaced with the size of the file in blocks.
For historic reasons, the block size is 1024 for algorithm 1 and 512
for algorithm 2.
Partial blocks are rounded up.
.El
.Pp
The following options apply only when using the one of the message
digest algorithms:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl n
Print the hash and the filename in the normal sum output form, with
the hash at the left and the filename following on the right.
.It Fl p
Echo input from standard input to standard output, and append the
selected message digest.
.It Fl s Ar string
Print the hash of the given string
.Ar string .
.It Fl t
Run a built-in message digest time trial.
.It Fl x
Run a built-in message digest test script.
The tests that are run
are supposed to encompass all the various tests in the suites that
accompany the algorithms' descriptions with the exception of the the
last test for the SHA-1 algorithm and the RIPEMD-160 algorithm.
The
last test for these is one million copies of the lower letter a.
.El
.Pp
The default
.Tn CRC
used is based on the polynomial used for
.Tn CRC
error checking
in the networking standard
.St -iso8802-3 .
The
.Tn CRC
checksum encoding is defined by the generating polynomial:
.Pp
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
G(x) = x^32 + x^26 + x^23 + x^22 + x^16 + x^12 +
     x^11 + x^10 + x^8 + x^7 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1
.Ed
.Pp
Mathematically, the
.Tn CRC
value corresponding to a given file is defined by
the following procedure:
.Bd -filled -offset indent
The
.Ar n
bits to be evaluated are considered to be the coefficients of a mod 2
polynomial M(x) of degree
.Ar n Ns \-1 .
These
.Ar n
bits are the bits from the file, with the most significant bit being the most
significant bit of the first octet of the file and the last bit being the least
significant bit of the last octet, padded with zero bits (if necessary) to
achieve an integral number of octets, followed by one or more octets
representing the length of the file as a binary value, least significant octet
first.
The smallest number of octets capable of representing this integer are used.
.Pp
M(x) is multiplied by x^32 (i.e., shifted left 32 bits) and divided by
G(x) using mod 2 division, producing a remainder R(x) of degree \*[Le] 31.
.Pp
The coefficients of R(x) are considered to be a 32-bit sequence.
.Pp
The bit sequence is complemented and the result is the CRC.
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Nm
and
.Nm sum
utilities exit 0 on success, and \*[Gt]0 if an error occurs.
