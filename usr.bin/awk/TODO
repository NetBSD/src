Besides general regression testing to ensure everything still works
with nawk instead of gawk, following GNU awk extensions should be implemented
or handled somehow (the list is probably incomplete, please add entries 
if anything is missing):

* String functions: gensub() (partly done, finish backref. support)
* (done) Time functions: strftime(), systime()
* --posix flag, which would switch off nawk extensions over POSIX awk (?)
* special file names: /dev/pid, /dev/ppid, /dev/pgrpid, /dev/user,
	/dev/stdin, /dev/stdout, /dev/stderr, /dev/fd/X
* special variables: ARGIND, ERRNO, FIELDWIDTHS, IGNORECASE, RT

Also, the manpage should be improved to be generally more helpful
and document extensions over what POSIX says about awk.

Other misc:
* run.c: don't limit files[] to FOPEN_MAX (which is ridiculously low),
  make the limit the current process open file limit
* nawk doesn't permit empty RE, like
// { do_something; }
