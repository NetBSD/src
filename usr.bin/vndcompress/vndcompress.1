.Nd compress and uncompress disk images in cloop2 format
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm

.Op Fl b Ar blocksize
.Op Fl k Ar checkpoint-blocks
.Op Fl l Ar length
.Op Fl p Ar partial-offset
.Op Fl w Ar winsize

.Op Fl d

.Ar compressed-image
.Ar image
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility compresses disk images in cloop2 format, which the kernel's
.Xr vnd 4
device can interpret as read-only disk devices using the
.Fl z
option to
.Xr vnconfig 8 .
.Pp
By default,
.Nm vndcompress
compresses an image, and
.Nm vnduncompress
uncompresses an image, but the
.Fl c
and
.Fl d
options can control whether either utility compresses or decompresses.
.Pp
The following options are available for the compression operation:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b Ar blocksize
Set the compression block size to
.Ar blocksize ,
which must be a multiple of 512 and must be no more than 4294966784, or
0xfffffe00.
(On 32-bit systems, the limit may be smaller, limited by the available
virtual address space.)
.Pp
For compatibility with the old version of
.Nm ,
the compression block size may instead be specified at the end of the
command line.
.It Fl k Ar checkpoint-blocks
Write a checkpoint after every
.Ar checkpoint-blocks
blocks of output.
If interrupted,
.Nm
can restart at the last checkpoint with the
.Fl r
option.
You can also request a checkpoint at any time by sending
.Dv SIGUSR2
to the
.Nm
process.
.It Fl l Ar length
Specify the length of the input, so that the input may be a pipe,
socket, or FIFO.
Otherwise, the input must know its size, i.e. must have its size
reported in
.Fa st_size
by
.Xr fstat 2 .
.It Fl p Ar partial-blocks
Stop after writing
.Ar partial-blocks
blocks of output.
This option is mainly useful for automatic testing of restarts.
.It Fl R
With the
.Fl r
option, if restarting fails, then abort right now and don't touch the
output file.
.It Fl r
Try to restart a partial compression from the last checkpoint.
If restarting fails, and the
.Fl R
option is not specified, then truncate the output file and start
compression afresh.
Restarting may fail for various reasons: if there have been no
checkpoints, or if the output file has been corrupted in some easily
recognizable ways, or if the input file's size has changed, or if the
block size does not match, and so on.
.El
.Pp
The following option is available for both compression and
decompression:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl w Ar winsize
Use an in-memory window of
.Ar winsize
entries into the table of compressed block offsets.
If
.Ar winsize
is zero,
.Nm
will use memory proportional to the number of blocks in the
uncompressed image, namely 64 bits or 8 bytes per block.
If
.Ar winsize
is nonzero,
.Nm
will use memory proportional to
.Ar winsize ,
and independent of the size of the uncompressed image.
.Pp
A nonzero
.Ar winsize
requires the compressed image to be a seekable file, which compression
requires anyway, in order to record the offsets of compressed blocks
once they are compressed and written, but which is a limitation for
decompression.
Thus, decompressing from a pipe is incompatible with a nonzero
.Ar winsize .
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
uses a fixed window size, unless decompressing with nonseekable input.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
Compress an ISO 9660 CD-ROM image:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# vndcompress cdrom.iso cdrom.izo
.Ed
.Pp
Send a 59 GB disk partition over a local network with netcat (don't do
this over the internet!):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# nc 10.0.1.2 12345 < /dev/rcgd1h
.Ed
.Pp
Receive it and save it compressed on another host, showing a progress
bar interactively, restarting if possible, and taking a checkpoint
every 16 MB (i.e., every 256 compression blocks, which are 64 KB by
default):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# nc -l 12345 | progress -l 59g \e
    vndcompress -l 59g -k 256 -r /dev/stdin disk.cloop2
.Ed
.Pp
If the process is interrupted and you rewire your network and disks so
that the receiving host now has the disk you want to image, you can
start up where you left off, using the
.Fl R
option to keep
.Nm
from clobbering the partial transfer if anything goes wrong:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# vndcompress -l 59g -k 256 -rR /dev/rcgd1h disk.cloop2
.Ed
.Pp
Mount the disk with
.Xr vnd 4 ,
assuming your kernel was built with the
.Dv VND_COMPRESSION
option enabled:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# vnconfig -z vnd0 disk.cloop2
# mount /dev/vnd0d /mnt
.Ed
.Sh SIGNALS
.Nm
responds to the following signals:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Dv SIGINFO , Dv SIGUSR1
Report progress to standard error.
.It Dv SIGUSR2
Write a checkpoint to disk now.
.El
.Sh FORMAT
The cloop2 format consists of a header, an offset table, and a sequence
of compressed blocks.
The header is described by the following packed structure:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct cloop2_header {
	char		cl2h_magic[128];
	uint32_t	cl2h_blocksize;
	uint32_t	cl2h_n_blocks;
} __packed;
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fa cl2h_magic
field is an arbitrary sequence of 128 bits, the
.Fa cl2h_blocksize
field is a big-endian integer number of bytes per compression block,
and the
.Fa cl2h_n_blocks
field is a big-endian integer number of the compression blocks in the
image.
.Pp
The offset table is a sequence of one more than
.Fa cl2h_n_blocks
big-endian 64-bit integers specifying the offset of each compression
block relative to the start of the file.
The extra offset specifies the end of the last compression block, which
may be truncated if the uncompressed image's size is not a multiple of
the compression block size.

.Xr vnconfig 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Nx 3.0 .
It was rewritten to be more robust, to support restarting partial
transfers, and to support bounded memory usage in
.Nx 7.0 .
