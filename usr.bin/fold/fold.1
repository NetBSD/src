.Nm
is a filter which folds the contents of the specified files,

breaking the lines to have a maximum of 80 characters.

.It Fl b
Count
.Ar width
in bytes rather than column positions.
.It Fl s
Fold line after the last blank character within the first
.Ar width
column positions (or bytes).
If a blank character does not exist within the width, then
a longer line will still be split at the width.
.It Fl w Ar width
