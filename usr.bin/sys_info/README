The sys_info script is a small script which will show the version
information for installed utilities.  It also works on the kernel, and
on most libraries.

Its use is as follow:

	[19:41:13] agc@netbsd-002 ...external/bsd/sys_info [4568] > ./sys_info -a
	awk-20121220
	bind-9.10.3pl3
	bzip2-1.0.6
	calendar-20160601
	ftpd-20110904
	g++-4.8.5
	gcc-4.8.5
	grep-2.5.1anb1
	gzip-20150113
	bozohttpd-20151231
	NetBSD-7.99.26
	netpgp-3.99.17
	netpgpverify-20160214
	ntp-4.2.8pl5
	openssl-1.0.1r
	sqlite3-3.12.2
	openssh-7.1
	opensshd-7.1
	tcsh-6.19.00
	xz-5.2.1
	[19:41:20] agc@netbsd-002 ...external/bsd/sys_info [4569] > ./sys_info ntp ssh netpgp
	ntp-4.2.8pl5
	openssh-7.1
	netpgp-3.99.17
	[19:41:31] agc@netbsd-002 ...external/bsd/sys_info [4570] > ./sys_info ntp ssh netbsd
	ntp-4.2.8pl5
	openssh-7.1
	NetBSD-7.99.26
	[19:41:38] agc@netbsd-002 ...external/bsd/sys_info [4571] >

The -a option can be given to the script to print out the information
on all known components.

The sys_info script also works on libraries, returning their
"versions" as given by the shared object version numbers.

	[19:45:06] agc@netbsd-002 ...external/bsd/sys_info [4572] > ./sys_info libevent libXfont libc netbsd
	libevent-4.0
	libXfont-3.0
	libc-12.200
	NetBSD-7.99.26
	[19:45:27] agc@netbsd-002 ...external/bsd/sys_info [4573] >
