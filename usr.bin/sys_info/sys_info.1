It is useful for finding out the installed versions of
the components of a system.
The
.Nm

information from the installed utilities.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width inits
.It Fl d
This option provides a destination directory, used

and libraries rooted in the file system directory,
such as the destination directory from a
.Dv build.sh
run.
.It Fl L
Give a list of directories
.Pq "colon separated"
that are used when searching for libraries.
If not given the value of
.Ev LD_LIBRARY_PATH
is used if set in the environment, or otherwise
a standard (built-in) set of directories.
.It Fl P
Set
.Ev PATH .
If not given, the system default path, as obtained from
.Ic user.cs_path
via
.Xr sysctl 8
is used.
To use the current value of $PATH from the caller, use:
.Dl -P \*q$PATH\*q
.It Fl v
Show the commands used to obtain the version information
for each component
.El
.Pp
