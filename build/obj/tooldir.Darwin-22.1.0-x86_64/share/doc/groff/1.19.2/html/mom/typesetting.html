<h2><a name="INTRO_MACROS_TYPESETTING"><u>Introduction to the typesetting macros</u></a></h2>

<strong>Mom</strong>'s typesetting macros provide access to
groff's typesetting capabilities.  Aside from controlling basic
type parameters (family, font, line length, point size, leading),
<strong>mom</strong>'s macros fine-tune wordspacing, letterspacing,
kerning, hyphenation, and so on.  In addition, <strong>mom</strong>
has true typesetting tabs, string tabs, multiple indent styles,
line padding, and a batch of other goodies.
<p>
In some cases, <strong>mom</strong>'s typesetting macros merely imitate
groff primitives.  In others, they approach typesetting concerns in
conceptually new ways (for groff, at least).  This should present no
problem for newcomers to groff who are learning <strong>mom</strong>.
Old groff hands should be careful.  Just because it looks like a
duck and walks like a duck does not, in this instance, mean that it
is a duck.  When using <strong>mom</strong>, stay away from groff
primitives if <strong>mom</strong> provides a macro that accomplishes
the same thing.
<p>
<strong>Mom</strong>'s typesetting macros can be used as a standalone
package, independent of the
<a href="docprocessing.html#DOCPROCESSING">document processing macros</a>.
With them, you can typeset on-the-fly.  Book covers, your best
friend's résumé, a poster for a lost dog--none of these requires
structured document processing (page headers, paragraphs, heads,
footnotes, etc).  What they do demand is precise control over every
element on the page.  The typesetting macros give you that control.

<a name="PAGE_MARGINS">
	<h2><u>Page setup: paper size and page margins</u></h2>
</a>

The page setup macros establish the physical dimensions of your
page and the margins you want it to have.  <strong>Groff</strong>
has defaults for these, but I recommend setting them at the top
of your files anyway unless you're using <strong>mom</strong>'s
<a href="docprocessing.html#DOCPROCESSING">document processing macros</a>
and are content with her defaults.
<p>
The
<a href="#PAPER">PAPER</a>
macro provides a shortcut for setting the page to the correct dimensions
for a number of well-known, established paper sizes.  The
<a href="#PAGE">PAGE</a>
macro provides a convenient way of setting the page dimensions and
some or all of the page margins with a single macro.

<!---PAGEWIDTH--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
	<a name="PAGEWIDTH"><h3><u>Page width</u></h3></a>
<br>
<nobr>Macro: <strong>PAGEWIDTH</strong> &lt;width of printer sheet&gt;</nobr>
<br>
<em>*Requires a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
The argument to <strong>PAGEWIDTH</strong> is the width of your
printer sheet.  <strong>PAGEWIDTH</strong> requires a unit of measure.
Decimal fractions are allowed.  Hence, to tell <strong>mom</strong>
the width of your printer sheet is 8-1/2 inches, you enter
<p>
<pre>
	.PAGEWIDTH 8.5i
</pre>

<!---PAGELENGTH--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
	<a name="PAGELENGTH"><h3><u>Page length</u></h3></a>
<br>
<nobr>Macro: <strong>PAGELENGTH</strong> &lt;length of printer sheet&gt;</nobr>
<br>
<em>*Requires a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
<strong>PAGELENGTH</strong> tells <strong>mom</strong> how long your
printer sheet is.  It works just like
<strong>PAGEWIDTH</strong>.  Therefore, to tell
<strong>mom</strong> your printer sheet is 11 inches long, you
enter
<p>
<pre>
	.PAGELENGTH 11i
</pre>

<!---PAPER--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
	<a name="PAPER"><h3><u>Paper</u></h3></a>
<br>
<nobr>Macro: <strong>PAPER</strong> &lt;paper type&gt;</nobr>

<p>
<strong>PAPER</strong> provides a convenient way to set the page
dimensions for some common printer sheet sizes.  <nobr>&lt;paper
type&gt; can be one of:</nobr>
<p>
<pre>
	LETTER
	LEGAL
	STATEMENT
	TABLOID
	LEDGER
	FOLIO
	QUARTO
	10x14
	EXECUTIVE
	A3
	A4
	A5
	B4
	B5 
</pre>

Say, for example, you have A4-sized sheets in your printer.
It's shorter (and easier) to enter
<p>
<pre>
	.PAPER A4
</pre>

than to remember the correct dimensions and enter
<p>
<pre>
	.PAGEWIDTH  595p
	.PAGELENGTH 842p
</pre>

<!---L_MARGIN--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
	<a name="L_MARGIN"><h3><u>Left margin</u></h3></a>
<br>
<nobr>Macro: <strong>L_MARGIN</strong> &lt;left margin&gt;</nobr>
<br>
<em>*Requires a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
<strong>L_MARGIN</strong> establishes the distance from the left edge
of the printer sheet at which you want your type to start.  It may
be used any time, and remains in effect until you enter a new value.
<p>
<a href="#IL">Left indents</a>
and
<a href="#TABS">tabs</a>
are calculated from the value you pass to <strong>L_MARGIN</strong>,
hence it's always a good idea to invoke it before starting any serious
typesetting.  A unit of measure is required.  Decimal fractions are
allowed.  Therefore, to set the left margin at 3 picas (1/2 inch),
you'd enter either
<p>
<pre>
	.L_MARGIN 3P
	&nbsp;&nbsp;or
	.L_MARGIN .5i
</pre>

If you use the macros
<a href="#PAGE">PAGE</a>,
<a href="#PAGEWIDTH">PAGEWIDTH</a>
or
<a href="#PAPER">PAPER</a>
without invoking <strong>L_MARGIN</strong> (either before
or afterwards), <strong>mom</strong> automatically sets
</strong>L_MARGIN</strong> to 1 inch.
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> L_MARGIN behaves in a special way when you're
using the
<a href="docprocessing.html#DOCPROCESSING">document processing macros</a>.
See
<a href="typemacdoc.html#TYPESETTING">Typesetting Macros in Document Processing</a>
for an explanation.
<p>

<!---R_MARGIN--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
	<a name="R_MARGIN"><h3><u>Right margin</u></h3></a>
<br>
<nobr>Macro: <strong>R_MARGIN</strong> &lt;right margin&gt;</nobr>
<br>
<em>*Requires a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
<strong>R_MARGIN</strong> establishes the amount of space you
want between the end of typeset lines and the right hand edge
of the printer sheet.  In other words, it sets the line length.
<strong>R_MARGIN</strong> requires a unit of measure.  Decimal
fractions are allowed.
<p>
The <a href="#LINELENGTH">line length macro</a> (<strong>LL</strong>) can
be used in place of <strong>R_MARGIN</strong>.  In either case, the
last one invoked sets the line length.  The choice of which to use is
up to you.  In some instances, you may find it easier to think of a
section of type as having a right margin.  In others, giving a line
length may make more sense.
<p>
For example, if you're setting a page of type you know should have
6-pica margins left and right, it makes sense to enter a left and
right margin, like this:
<p>
<pre>
	.L_MARGIN 6P
	.R_MARGIN 6P
</pre>

That way, you don't have to worry about calculating the line
length.  On the other hand, if you know the line length for a
patch of type should be 17 picas and 3 points, entering the line
length with <strong>LL</strong> is much easier than calculating the
right margin.
<p>
<pre>
	.LL 17P+3p
</pre>

If you use the macros
<a href="#PAGE">PAGE</a>,
<a href="#PAGEWIDTH">PAGEWIDTH</a>
or
<a href="#PAPER">PAPER</a>
without invoking <strong>R_MARGIN</strong> afterwards,
<strong>mom</strong> automatically sets <strong>R_MARGIN</strong>
to 1 inch.  If you set a line length after these macros (with
<a href="#LINELENGTH">LL</a>),
the line length calculated by <strong>R_MARGIN</strong> is, of course,
overridden.
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT: R_MARGIN</strong>, if used, MUST come after
<a href="#PAPER">PAPER</a>,
<a href="#PAGEWIDTH">PAGEWIDTH</a>,
<a href="#L_MARGIN">L_MARGIN</a>
and/or
<a href="#PAGE">PAGE</a>
(if a right margin isn't given to <strong>PAGE</strong>).
The reason is that <strong>R_MARGIN</strong> calculates line
length from the overall page dimensions and the left margin.
Obviously, it can't make the calculation if it doesn't know the page
width and the left margin.
<p>
<strong>NOTE: R_MARGIN</strong> behaves in a special way
when you're using the
<a href="docprocessing.html#DOCPROCESSING">document processing macros</a>.
See
<a href="typemacdoc.html#TYPESETTING">Typesetting Macros in Document Processing</a>
for an explanation.
<p>

<!---T_MARGIN--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
	<a name="T_MARGIN"><h3><u>Top margin</u></h3></a>
<br>
<nobr>Macro: <strong>T_MARGIN</strong> &lt;top margin&gt;</nobr>
<br>
<em>*Requires a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
<strong>T_MARGIN</strong> establishes the distance from the top of
the printer sheet at which you want your type to start.  It requires
a unit of measure, and decimal fractions are allowed.  To set a top
margin of 2-1/2 centimetres, you'd enter
<p>
<pre>
	.T_MARGIN 2.5c
</pre>

<strong>T_MARGIN</strong> calculates the vertical position of the
first line of type on a page by treating the top edge of the printer
sheet as a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_BASELINE">baseline</a>.  Therefore,
<p>
<pre>
	.T_MARGIN 1.5i
</pre>

puts the baseline of the first line of type 1-1/2 inches beneath
the top of the page.
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> <strong>T_MARGIN</strong> does two
things: it establishes the top margin for pages that come after
it AND it moves to that position on the current page.  Therefore,
<strong>T_MARGIN</strong> should only be used at the top of a file
(prior to entering text) or after
<a href="#NEWPAGE">NEWPAGE</a>,
like this:
<p>
<pre>
	.NEWPAGE
	.T_MARGIN 6P
	&lt;text&gt;
</pre>

<strong>NOTE:</strong> <strong>T_MARGIN</strong> means something
slightly different when you're using the
<a href="docprocessing.html#DOCPROCESSING">document processing macros</a>.
See
<a href="typemacdoc.html#TB_MARGINS">Top and bottom margins in document processing</a>
for an explanation.
<p>

<!---B_MARGIN--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
	<a name="B_MARGIN"><h3><u>Bottom margin</u></h3></a>
<br>
<nobr>Macro: <strong>B_MARGIN</strong> &lt;bottom margin&gt;</nobr>
<br>
<em>*Requires a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
<strong>B_MARGIN</strong> sets a nominal position at the bottom
of the page beyond which you don't want your type to go.  When the
bottom margin is reached, <strong>mom</strong> starts a new page.
<strong>B_MARGIN</strong> requires a unit of measure.  Decimal
fractions are allowed.  To set a nominal bottom margin of 3/4 inch,
enter
<p>
<pre>
	.B_MARGIN .75i
</pre>

Obviously, if you haven't spaced the type on your pages so that
the last lines fall perfectly at the bottom margin, the margin will
vary from page to page.  Usually, but not always, the last line of
type that fits on a page <em>before</em> the bottom margin causes
<strong>mom</strong> to start a new page.
<p>
Occasionally, owing to a peculiarity in <strong>groff</strong>,
an extra line will fall below the nominal bottom margin.  If you're
using the
<a href="docprocessing.html#DOCPROCESSING">document processing macros</a>,
this is unlikely to happen; the document processing macros are very
hard-nosed about aligning bottom margins.
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> The meaning of <strong>B_MARGIN</strong> is
slightly different when you're using the document processing macros.
See
<a href="typemacdoc.html#TB_MARGINS">Top and bottom margins in document processing</a>
for an explanation.
<p>

<!---PAGE--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
	<a name="PAGE"><h3><u>Page</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>PAGE</strong>
<nobr>&lt;width&gt;&nbsp;[ &lt;length&gt; [ &lt;lm&gt; [ &lt;rm&gt; [ &lt;tm&gt; [ &lt;bm&gt; ] ] ] ] ]</nobr>
<br>
<em>*All arguments require a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
<strong>PAGE</strong> lets you establish paper dimensions and page
margins with a single macro.  The only required argument is page width.
The rest are optional, <strong>but they must appear in order and you can't
skip over any.</strong>  <nobr>&lt;lm&gt;, &lt;rm&gt;, &lt;tm&gt;</nobr>
and <nobr>&lt;bm&gt; refer to the left, right, top and bottom</nobr>
margins respectively.
<p>
Assuming your page dimensions are 11 inches by 17 inches, and that's
all you want to set, enter
<p>
<pre>
	.PAGE 11i 17i
</pre>

If you want to set the left margin as well, say, at 1 inch,
<strong>PAGE</strong> would look like this:
<p>
<pre>
	.PAGE 11i 17i 1i
</pre>

Now suppose you also want to set the top margin, say, at 1-1/2
inches.  <nobr>&lt;tm&gt; comes after <nobr>&lt;rm&gt;</nobr></nobr>
in the optional arguments, but you can't skip over any arguments,
therefore to set the top margin, you must also give a right margin.
The <strong>PAGE</strong> macro would look like this:
<p>
<pre>
        .PAGE 11i 17i 1i 1i 1.5i
                         |   |
        required right___|   |___top margin
                margin
</pre>

Clearly, <strong>PAGE</strong> is best used when you want a convenient
way to tell <strong>mom</strong> just the dimensions of your printer
sheet (width and length), or when you want to tell her everything
about the page (dimensions and all the margins), for example
<p>
<pre>
	.PAGE 8.5i 11i 45p 45p 45p 45p
</pre>

This sets up an 8-1/2 by 11 inch page with margins of 45 points
(5/8-inch) all around.
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Only use <strong>PAGE</strong> at the
start of a document, before entering any text.  And remember,
when you're using the
<a href="docprocessing.html#DOCPROCESSING">document processing macros</a>,
top margin and bottom margin mean something slightly different than
when you're  using just the typesetting macros (see
<a href="typemacdoc.html#TB_MARGINS">Top and bottom margins in document processing</a>).
<p>
Additionally, if you invoke <strong>PAGE</strong> with a top margin
argument, any macros you invoke after <strong>PAGE</strong> will
almost certainly move the
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_BASELINE">baseline</a>
of the first line of text down by one linespace.  To compensate, do
<p>
<pre>
	.RLD 1v
</pre>

immediately before entering any text, or, if it's feasible, make
<strong>PAGE</strong> the last macro you invoke prior to entering text.
<p>

<!---NEWPAGE--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="NEWPAGE"><h3><u>Start a new page</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>NEWPAGE</strong>

<p>
Whenever you want to start a new page, use <strong>NEWPAGE</strong>, by
itself with no argument.  <strong>Mom</strong> will finish up
processing the current page and move you to the top of a new one
(subject to the top margin set with
<a href="#T_MARGIN">T_MARGIN</a>.
<p>
<strong>Experts:</strong> Prior to version 1.1.9,
<strong>NEWPAGE</strong> was simply an alias of
<strong>.bp</strong>.  As of 1.1.9, <strong>NEWPAGE</strong>,
is its own <strong>mom</strong> macro.  While the new macro
should be backwardly compatible with documents created using
pre-1.1.9 <strong>mom</strong>s, I suggest that from this version
onward, if you were in the habit of using <strong>.bp</strong>
whenever you wanted to break to a new page, you now begin to use
<strong>NEWPAGE</strong> instead.

Basic parameter macros deal with the fundamental requirements
for setting type: family, font, point size, leading and line length.
<p>
If you're using the typesetting macros only, the arguments passed

The document processing macros handle things differently.  See

<!---FAMILY--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="FAMILY"><h3><u>Type family</u></h3></a>
<br>
<nobr>Macro: <strong>FAMILY</strong> &lt;family&gt;</nobr>
<br>
Alias: <strong>FAM</strong>

<p>
<strong>FAMILY</strong> takes one argument: the name of the
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FAMILY">family</a>
you want.  Groff comes with a number of PostScript families, each
identified by a 1-, 2- or 3-letter mnemonic.  The standard families
are:
<table valign="baseline" summary="family">
<tr><td width="15"><td><strong>A</strong><td>Avant Garde
<tr><td><td><strong>BM</strong> <td>Bookman
<tr><td><td><strong>H</strong><td>Helvetica
<tr><td><td><strong>HN</strong><td>Helvetica Narrow
<tr><td><td><strong>N</strong><td>New Century Schoolbook
<tr><td><td><strong>P</strong><td>Palatino
<tr><td><td><strong>T</strong><td>Times Roman</td></tr>
<tr><td><td><strong>ZCM</strong><td>Zapf Chancery</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The argument you pass to <strong>FAMILY</strong> is the identifier at
left, above.  For example, if you want Helvetica, enter
<p>
<pre>
	.FAMILY H
</pre>

<strong>NOTE:</strong> The
<a href="#FONT">font macro</a>
(<strong>FT</strong>) lets you specify both the type family
and the desired font with a single macro.  While this saves a few
keystrokes, I recommend using <strong>FAMILY</strong> for family,
and <strong>FT</strong> for font, except where doing so is genuinely
inconvenient. <strong>ZCM</strong>, for example, only exists in one
style: Italic (<strong>I</strong>).  Therefore, <kbd>.FT ZCMI</kbd>
makes more sense than setting the family to &quot;ZCM&quot;, then
setting the font to &quot;I&quot;.
<p>
<a name="FAM_ADD_NOTE"></a>
<strong>ADDITIONAL NOTE:</strong> As of <strong>mom, version
1.1.9-a</strong>, if you are running a version of groff lower
than 1.19.2, you <em>MUST</em> follow all <strong>FAMILY</strong>
requests with a <strong>FT</strong> request, otherwise
<strong>mom</strong> will set all type up to the next
<strong>FT</strong> request in the
<a href="#FALLBACK_FONT">fallback font</a>.
<p>
If you are running a version of groff greater than or equal
to 1.19.2, when you invoke the <strong>FAMILY</strong> macro,
<strong>mom</strong> &quot;remembers&quot; the font style (Roman,
Italic, etc) currently in use (if the font style exists in the new
family) and will continue to use the same font style in the new
family.  For example:
<p>
<pre>
	.FAMILY BM   \" Bookman family
	.FT     I    \" Medium Italic
	&lt;some text&gt;  \" Bookman Medium Italic
	.FAMILY H    \" Helvetica family
	&lt;more text&gt;  \" Helvetica Medium Italic
</pre>

However, if the font style does not exist in the new family,
<strong>mom</strong> will set all subsequent type in the
<a href="#FALLBACK_FONT">fallback font</a>
(by default, Courier Medium Roman) until she encounters a
<a href="#FONT">.FT</a>
request that's valid for the family.  For example, assuming
you don't have the font &quot;Medium Condensed Roman&quot;
(<strong>mom</strong> extension &quot;<strong>CD</strong>&quot;)
in the Helvetica family:
<p>
<pre>
	.FAMILY UN    \" Univers family
	.FT     CD    \" Medium Condensed
	&lt;some text&gt;   \" Univers Medium Condensed
	.FAMILY H     \" Helvetica family
	&lt;more text&gt;   \" Courier Medium Roman!
</pre>

In the above example, you must follow <kbd>.FAMILY H</kbd> with a
<strong>FT</strong> request that's valid for Helvetica.
<p>
<strong>Experts:</strong>
<br>
If you add other PostScript families to groff's /font/devps directory,
I recommend following the groff standard for naming families and fonts.
For example, if you add the Garamond family, name the font files
<p>
<pre>
	GARAMONDR
	GARAMONDI
	GARAMONDB
	GARAMONDBI
</pre>

GARAMOND then becomes a legal family name you can pass to
<strong>FAMILY</strong>.  (You could, of course, shorten GARAMOND to just
G, or GD.)  R, I, B, and BI after GARAMOND are the roman, italic,
bold and bold-italic fonts respectively.
<p>
Please see the Appendices,
<a href="appendices.html#FONTS">Adding PostScript fonts to groff</a>,
for information on adding fonts and families to groff, as well as
to see a list of the extensions <strong>mom</strong> provides to
groff's basic <strong>R, I, B, BI</strong> styles.

<nobr>Macro: <strong>FT</strong> R | I | B | BI | &lt;any other valid font style&gt;</nobr>

<p>
By default, groff permits <strong>FT</strong> to take one of four
possible arguments specifying the desired font:
<table valign="baseline" summary="font">
<tr><td width="15"><td><strong>R</strong><td> = <td>(Medium) Roman
<tr><td><td><strong>I</strong><td> = <td>(Medium) Italic
<tr><td><td><strong>B</strong><td> = <td>Bold (Roman)
<tr><td><td><strong>BI</strong><td> = <td>Bold Italic</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
For example, if your
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FAMILY">family</a>
is Helvetica, entering
<p>
<pre>
	.FT B
</pre>

will give you the Helvetica bold
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FONT">font</a>.
If your family were Palatino, you'd get the Palatino bold font.
<p>
(As of <strong>mom, version 1.1.9-a,</strong> the range of arguments
that can be passed to <strong>FT</strong> has been considerably
extended, allowing access to a greater variety of font
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_WEIGHT">weights</a>
and
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_SHAPE">shapes</a>.
Please see the
<a href="#FONT_NOTE">NOTE</a>,
below.)
<p>
How <strong>mom</strong> reacts to an invalid argument to
<strong>FT</strong> depends on which version of groff you're using.
If your groff version is greater than or equal to 1.19.2,
<strong>mom</strong> will issue a warning and, depending on how
you've set up the
<a href="#FALLBACK_FONT">fallback font</a>,
either continue processing using the fallback font, or abort
(allowing you to correct the problem).  If your groff version is less
than 1.19.2, <strong>mom</strong> will silently continue processing,
using either the fallback font or the font that was in effect prior
to the invalid <strong>FT</strong> call.
<p>
<strong>FT</strong> will also accept, as an argument, a full
family+font name.  For example,
<p>
<pre>
	.FT HB
</pre>

will set subsequent type in Helvetica Bold.  However, I strongly
recommend keeping family and font separate except where doing so is
genuinely inconvenient.
<p>
For inline control of fonts, see
<a href="inlines.html#INLINE_FONTS_MOM">Inline Escapes, font control</a>.
<p>
<a name="FONT_NOTE"></a>
<strong>NOTE: mom, versions 1.1.9-a</strong> and higher,
considerably extends the range of arguments you can pass to
<strong>FT</strong>, making it more convenient to add and access
fonts of differing
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_WEIGHT">weights</a>
and
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_SHAPE">shapes</a>
within the same family.  Have a look
<a href="appendices.html#STYLE_EXTENSIONS">here</a>
for a list of the weight/style arguments <strong>mom</strong>
allows.
<p>
Be aware, though, that you must have the fonts, correctly
installed and named, in order to use the arguments.  (See
<a href="appendices.html#HOWTO">How to create a PostScript font for use with groff</a>
for how to add fonts to groff.)  Please also read the
<a href="#FAM_ADD_NOTE">ADDITIONAL NOTE</a>
found in the description of the <strong>FAMILY</strong> macro.
<p>

<!---FALLBACK_FONT--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="FALLBACK_FONT"><h3><u>Fallback font</u></h3></a>
<br>
<nobr>Macro: <strong>FALLBACK_FONT</strong> &lt;fallback font&gt; [ ABORT | WARN ] | ABORT | WARN</nobr>

<p>
In the event that you pass an invalid argument to
<a href="#FONT">.FAMILY</a>
(i.e. a non-existent family), <strong>mom</strong>, by default, uses
the fallback font, Courier Medium Roman (CR), in order to continue
processing your file.
<p>
If you'd prefer another fallback font, pass
<strong>FALLBACK_FONT</strong> the <strong>full family+font name
of the font you'd like</strong>.  For example, if you'd rather the
fallback font were Times Roman Medium Roman,

<pre>
	.FALLBACK_FONT TR
</pre>
<p>
would do the trick.
<p>
Additionally, if your version of groff accepts accepts &quot;if
F&quot; and &quot;if S&quot; (see
<a href="#FAM_ADD_NOTE">above</a>),
<strong>mom</strong> issues a warning whenever a
<strong>font style</strong> set with
<a href="#FONT">.FT</a>
does not exist, either because you haven't registered the style
(see
<a href="appendices.html#REGISTER_STYLE">here</a>
for instructions on registering styles), or because the font style
does not exist in the current family set with
<a href="#FAMILY">.FAMILY</a>.
By default, <strong>mom</strong> then aborts, which allows you to
correct the problem.
<p>
If you'd prefer that <strong>mom</strong> not abort on non-existent
fonts, but rather continue processing using a fallback font,
you can pass <strong>FALLBACK_FONT</strong> the argument
<strong>WARN</strong>, either by itself, or in conjunction with your
chosen fallback font.
<p>
<strong>Some examples of invoking FALLBACK_FONT:</strong>
<br>
<ul>
	<li><kbd>.FALLBACK_FONT WARN</kbd>
		<br>
		<strong>mom</strong> will issue a warning whenever you try
		to access a non-existent font but will continue processing
		your file with the default fallback font, Courier Medium Roman.
	<li><kbd>.FALLBACK_FONT TR WARN</kbd>
		<br>
		<strong>mom</strong> will issue a warning whenever you try
		to access a non-existent font but will continue processing
		your file with a fallback font of Times Roman Medium Roman;
		additionally, &quot;TR&quot; will be the fallback font whenever
		you try to access a <strong>family</strong> that does not exist.
	<li><kbd>.FALLBACK_FONT TR ABORT</kbd>
		<br>
		<strong>mom</strong> will abort whenever you try to access a
		non-existent font, and will use the fallback font
		&quot;TR&quot; whenever you try to access a <strong>family</strong>
		that does not exist.
</ul>
<p>
If, for some reason, you want to revert to ABORT, just enter
<kbd>.FALLBACK_FONT ABORT</kbd> and <strong>mom</strong> will once
again abort on font errors.
<p>

<!---PT_SIZE--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="PS"><h3><u>Point size of type</u></h3></a>
<br>
<nobr>Macro: <strong>PT_SIZE</strong> &lt;size of type in points&gt;</nobr>
<br>
<em>*Does not require a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
<strong>PT_SIZE</strong> (Point Size) takes one argument: the size of type
in points.  Unlike most other macros that establish the size or measure
of something, <strong>PT_SIZE</strong> does not require that you supply a
unit of measure since it's a near universal convention that type size
is measured in points.  Therefore, to change the type size to, say,
11 points, enter
<p>
<pre>
	.PT_SIZE 11
</pre>

Point sizes may be fractional (e.g.  10.25 or 12.5).
<p>
You can prepend a plus or a minus sign to the argument to
<strong>PT_SIZE</strong>, in which case the point size will be changed by +
or - the original value.  For example, if the point size is 12,
and you want 14, you can do
<p>
<pre>
	.PT_SIZE +2
</pre>

then later reset it to 12 with
<p>
<pre>
	.PT_SIZE -2
</pre>

The size of type can also be changed inline.  See
<a href="inlines.html#INLINE_SIZE_MOM">Inline Escapes, changing point size</a>.
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> It is unfortunate that the <kbd>pic</kbd>
pre-processor uses <strong>PS</strong>, and thus
<strong>mom</strong>'s macro for setting point sizes can't use it.
However, if you aren't using <kbd>pic</kbd>, you might want to
alias <strong>PT_SIZE</strong> as <strong>PS</strong>, since
there'd be no conflict.
<p>
<pre>
	.ALIAS PS PT_SIZE
</pre>

would allow you to set point sizes with <kbd>.PS</kbd>.
<p>

<!---LS--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="LEADING"><h3><u>Line spacing/leading</u></h3></a>
<br>
<nobr>Macro: <strong>LS</strong> &lt;distance between lines&gt;</nobr>
<br>
<em>*Does not require a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
<strong>LS</strong> (Line Space) takes one argument: the distance you want, typically
in points, from baseline to baseline of type.  The argument may
be fractional (e.g. 12.25 or 14.5).  Like <strong>PT_SIZE</strong>,
<strong>LS</strong> does not require a unit of measure, since
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_LEADING">leading</a>
is most often given in points.  Therefore, to set the linespace to
14 points, you would enter
<p>
<pre>
	.LS 14
</pre>

However, if you wish, you may specify a unit of measure by appending
it directly to the argument passed to <strong>LS</strong>.  For example,
if you want a linespace of 1/4 of an inch, enter
<p>
<pre>
	.LS .25i
</pre>

You can prepend a plus or a minus sign to the argument to
<strong>LS</strong>, in which case the line spacing will be changed
by + or - the original value.  For example, if the line spacing is
14 points, and you want 17 points, you can do
<p>
<pre>
	.LS +3
</pre>

then later reset it to 14 points with
<p>
<pre>
	.LS -3
</pre>

<strong>Experts:</strong>
<br>
<strong>LS</strong> should not be confused with the groff primitive
<strong>ls</strong>.  <strong>LS</strong> acts like <strong>vs</strong>.
<strong>mom</strong> does not provide a macro analogous to
<strong>ls</strong>.
<p>

<!---AUTOLEAD--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="AUTOLEAD"><h3><u>Automatic line spacing</u></h3></a>
<br>
<nobr>Macro: <strong>AUTOLEAD</strong> &lt;amount of automatic leading&gt; [FACTOR]</nobr>
<br>
<em>*Does not require a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
Without the <strong>FACTOR</strong> argument, <strong>AUTOLEAD</strong>
calculates the linespace for you by adding its argument to the
current point size of type. All subsequent <strong>PT_SIZE</strong>
requests automatically update the linespacing by the autolead amount.
<p>
Used in this way, <strong>AUTOLEAD</strong> does not require a unit
of measure; points is assumed.  However, you may use an alternate
unit of measure by appending it to the argument.  The argument may
be a decimal fraction (e.g. .5 or 2.75).
<p>
As an example, if your current point size of type is 12, entering
<p>
<pre>
	.AUTOLEAD 2
</pre>

changes the linespace to 14 points, regardless any linespacing
already in effect.  From here on, every change to the size of type
(with <strong>PT_SIZE</strong>, not
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INLINES">inline</a>)
changes the linespace as well.  If you decrease the type size to 9
points, the leading decreases to 11 points.  If you increase the type
size to 16 points, the leading increases to 18 points.
<p>
Automatic updating of the linespacing continues until you enter a
&quot;manual&quot; line space value with <strong>LS</strong>.
<p>
If you give <strong>AUTOLEAD</strong> the optional
<strong>FACTOR</strong> argument, <strong>AUTOLEAD</strong>
calculates the line space as a factor of the
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_NUMERICARGUMENT">numeric argument</a>
you gave <strong>AUTOLEAD</strong>.  For example, if your point
size is 12,
<p>
<pre>
	.AUTOLEAD 1.125 FACTOR
</pre>
sets the leading at 13.5 points.  If you change the point size
to 14, the leading automatically changes to 15.75 (14 x 1.125).
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> There's no need to prepend a plus sign (+)
to <strong>AUTOLEAD</strong>'s argument, although you may do so if you
wish.
<p>

<!---LL--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="LINELENGTH"><h3><u>Line length</u></h3></a>
<br>
<nobr>Macro: <strong>LL</strong> &lt;line length&gt;</nobr>
<br>
<em>*Requires a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
<strong>LL</strong> (Line Length) takes one argument: the distance from the
left margin of the page to the maximum allowable point on the
right at which groff should place type.  The line length, in
other words, as the macro suggests.
<p>
<strong>LL</strong> requires a unit of measure.  Therefore, to set the line
length to 39 picas, you would enter
<p>
<pre>
	.LL 39P
</pre>

As with other macros that require a unit of measure, the argument to
<strong>LL</strong> may be fractional.  For example,
<p>
<pre>
	.LL 4.5i
</pre>

sets the line length to 4-1/2 inches.

<p>
Additionally, you may express a new line length relative to the
current line length by prepending a plus or minus sign to the
argument.  Thus, if you wanted to increase the line length by 3
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_PICASPOINTS">points</a>, you could
do
<p>
<pre>
	.LL +3p
</pre>

This is especially handy when you want to &quot;hang&quot;
punctuation outside the right margin since you can pass groff's
<a href="inlines.html#INLINE_STRINGWIDTH_GROFF"><strong>\w</strong></a>
escape as the argument to <strong>LL</strong>, like this:
<p>
<pre>
	.LL +\w'.'u
</pre>

The above example increases the current line length by the width of
a period.  Notice that you must append the
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a>,
<strong>u</strong>, to the escape since .LL requires a unit of
measure.

<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> The <a href="#R_MARGIN">right margin
macro</a> (<strong>R_MARGIN</strong>) can also be used to set line
length.

<a name="INTRO_JUST_QUAD_FILL"></a>

<a name="JUST_QUAD_FILL">
	<h2><u>Justifying, quadding, filling and breaking lines</u></h2>
</a>

The justification and quadding macros deal with how type aligns along
the left and right margins.  In a nutshell, type either aligns at the
left margin, at the right margin, at both margins, or at neither margin
(centred).
<p>
These macros also determine whether or not
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INPUTLINE">input lines</a>
are joined and
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FILLED">filled</a>
during output.
<p>
Additionally, macros that deal with how to break

<!---JUSTIFY--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="JUSTIFY"><h3><u>Justify lines</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>JUSTIFY</strong>
<br>
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FILLED"><em>Fill mode</em></a>

<p>
<strong>JUSTIFY</strong> doesn't take an argument. 
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INPUTLINE">Input lines</a>
after <strong>JUSTIFY</strong> are
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FILLED">filled</a> and
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_JUST">justified</a>

<p>
To break lines and prevent them from being filled and justified,
use the

<p>

<!---QUAD--->

<br>
Alias: <strong>FILL</strong>
<br>
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FILLED"><em>Fill mode</em></a>

<p>
<strong>QUAD</strong> takes one argument: the direction in which lines

<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INPUTLINE">Input lines</a>
after <strong>QUAD</strong> are

<p>
If <strong>R</strong> or <strong>RIGHT</strong>, type is
set flush along the right margin.
<p>
If <strong>C</strong> or <strong>CENTER</strong> type is set centred
on the current line length.
<p>
<strong>J</strong> and <strong>JUSTIFY</strong> justify text,
and are included as a convenience only.  Obviously, if text is
justified, it isn't quadded.  <strong>QUAD J</strong> and
<strong>QUAD JUSTIFY</strong> have exactly the same effect as <a
href="#JUSTIFY">JUSTIFY</a>.
<p>
To break lines and prevent them from being filled, use the
<a href="#BR">BR</a> macro.
<p>

<!---LEFT, RIGHT, CENTER--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="LRC"><h3><u>Set non-filled lines flush left, right, or centred</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>LEFT</strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Macro: <strong>RIGHT</strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Macro: <strong>CENTER</strong>
&nbsp;(alias <strong>CENTRE</strong>)
<br>
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_NOFILL"><em>Nofill mode</em></a>

<p>
<strong>LEFT</strong>, <strong>RIGHT</strong> and
<strong>CENTER</strong> let you enter text on a line for line basis
without having to use the
<a href="#BR">BR</a> macro after each line.
Consider the following:
<p>
<pre>
	.QUAD LEFT
	So runs my dream, but what am I?
	.BR
	An infant crying in the night
	.BR
	An infant crying for the light
	.BR
	And with no language but a cry.
	.BR
</pre>

Because text after <strong>QUAD</strong> is
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FILLED">filled</a>, you have to use the
<a href="#BR">BR</a>
macro to prevent the lines from running together.  Not only is this
annoying to type, it's awkward to read in a text editor.  Much better
to do
<p>
<pre>
	.LEFT
	So runs my dream, but what am I?
	An infant crying in the night
	An infant crying for the light
	And with no language but a cry.
</pre>

<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Because <strong>LEFT</strong>,
<strong>RIGHT</strong> and <strong>CENTER</strong> are nofill
modes, groff does not always respect the current line length.
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INPUTLINE">Input lines</a>
that run long may exceed it, or get broken in undesirable ways.
Therefore, when using these three macros, you should preview your
work to ensure that all lines fit as expected.
<p>

<!---BR--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="BR"><h3><u>Manually break lines</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>BR</strong>

<p>
When using <strong>JUSTIFY</strong> or <strong>QUAD</strong>,
<strong>BR</strong> tells <strong>mom</strong> about partial lines
that you want broken (as opposed to
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FILLED">filled</a>).
Any partial
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_OUTPUTLINE">output line</a>
that immediately precedes <strong>BR</strong> will be
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_QUAD">quadded</a>
in the direction of the current quad, or set flush left if text is
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_JUST">justified</a>.

<p>
Most of the time, you won't need the <strong>BR</strong> macro.
In fill modes, <strong>mom</strong> tries to be sensible about
where breaks are needed.  If the nature of a macro is such that under
most circumstances you'd expect a break, <strong>mom</strong> puts
it in herself.  Equally, in macros where a break isn't normally
desirable, no break occurs.  This means text files don't get cluttered
with annoying <strong>BR</strong>'s.
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Lines of text in
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_NOFILL">nofill mode</a>
never require a <strong>BR</strong>.  Furthermore, in nofill mode,
ALL macros cause a break.  If a break is not desired, use the
<a href="#JOIN">\c</a>
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INLINES">inline escape</a>.

<p>
<strong>Experts: BR</strong> is an alias for <strong>br</strong>.
You can use either, or mix 'n' match with impunity.
<p>

<!---EL--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="EL"><h3><u>Manually break a line without advancing on the page</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>EL</strong>
<br>
<em>*In nofill modes (LEFT, RIGHT, CENTER), you must terminate the
line input preceding EL with the </em><kbd>\c</kbd><em> inline
escape.  See
<a href="#EL_NOTES">NOTES</a>,
below.
<br>
*If you find remembering whether to put in the <kbd>\c</kbd>
bothersome, you may prefer to use the
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INLINES">inline escape</a>
alternative to 
<kbd>.EL</kbd>,
<a href="inlines.html#B">\*[B]</a>,
which works consistently regardless of the fill mode.
<br>
*EL does not work after the PAD macro.
See
<a href="goodies.html#PAD">PAD</a>
for the way around this</em>.
<p>
The mnemonic "EL" is borrowed from old Compugraphic typesetting
systems, where it stood for "End Line."  Conceptually,
<strong>EL</strong> is equivalent to the notion of a carriage return
with no linefeed.

<p>
<em>Note to groff jocks:</em> <strong>EL</strong> is
unrelated to groff's <strong>.el</strong>.  If you find the
similarity confusing, you may want to alias <strong>EL</strong> as
something else (but don't use <strong>EOL</strong>; it's already
taken.)

<p>
<strong>EL</strong>'s function is simple: it breaks a line without
advancing on the page.
<a name="EL_EXAMPLE">As</a>
an example of where you might use it,
imagine that you're working from marked-up copy.  The markup
indicates 24 points of space between two given lines, but the
prevailing line spacing is 12.5 points.  You may find it more
convenient to break the first line with <strong>EL</strong> and
instruct <strong>mom</strong> to advance 24 points to the next line
instead of calculating the lead that needs to be added to 12.5 to
get 24.  To demonstrate:
<p>
<pre>
	.LEFT
	.LS 12.5
	A line of text.\c
	.EL
	.ALD 24p
	The next line of text.
</pre>

may be more intuitive than
<p>
<pre>
	.LEFT
	.LS 12.5
	A line of text.
	.ALD 11.5p
	The next line of text.
</pre>

The first example has the further advantage that should you wish
to change the prevailing line space but keep the 24 points lead,
you don't have to recalculate the extra space.
<p>
"ALD" in the above examples stands for "<strong>A</strong>dvance
<strong>L</strong>ea<strong>D</strong>" (another mnemonic borrowed
from Compugraphic), which is covered in the section
<a href="#ALDRLD">Vertical movement</a>.
<p>
<a name="EL_NOTES"><strong>NOTES:</strong></a>
<p>
In versions of mom prior to 1.1.9, <strong>EL</strong> did not
always work as advertised on the last
<a name="TERMS_OUTPUTLINE">output line</a>
of pages that contained a footer trap (e.g. one set with
<a href="#B_MARGIN">B_MARGIN</a>
or in  documents formatted using the
<a href="docprocessing.html#DOCPROCESSING">document processing macros</a>).
<p>
<strong>EL</strong> has been re-written so that this should no longer be the
case.  However, in order for it to work in the
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_NOFILL">nofill</a>
modes
(<a href="#LRC">LEFT</a>,
<a href="#LRC">RIGHT</a>
or
<a href="#LRC">CENTER</a>),
you must always &quot;join&quot; <strong>.EL</strong> to the line
before it using the
<a href="#JOIN">\c</a>
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INLINES">inline escape</a>,
like this:
<p>
<pre>
	.LEFT
	A line I don't want to advance\c
	.EL
</pre>

Conversely, in
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FILLED">fill modes</a>
(<a href="#QUAD">QUAD LEFT</a>,
<a href="#QUAD">QUAD RIGHT</a>,
<a href="#QUAD">QUAD CENTER</a>
or
<a href="#JUSTIFY">JUSTIFY</a>),
the <strong>\c</strong> must not be used.
<p>
If <strong>EL</strong> is used after most macros or groff
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_PRIMITIVES">primitives</a>
(see the exception, below), you don't have to worry about this,
regardless of the fill mode.  Just type <kbd>.EL</kbd>

<p>
<strong>SPACE</strong> breaks a line, just like
<strong>BR</strong>, then adds space after the line.  With no

<p>
If you supply a unit of measure, <strong>SPACE</strong> breaks the
line then advances one linespace (at the current
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_LEADING">leading</a>)
PLUS the specified amount of extra space given to
<strong>SPACE</strong>,
as in
<p>
<pre>
	.SPACE 6p
</pre>

which breaks the line and advances one full linespace plus six
points.

<p>
<strong>SUGGESTION: SPACE</strong> and
<a href="#ALD">ALD</a>
can be used interchangeably (<code>.SPACE&nbsp;6p</code> and
<code>.ALD&nbsp;6p</code> are equivalent).  However,
<strong>ALD</strong> without an argument does nothing, whereas
<strong>SPACE</strong> without an argument adds an extra line
space.  I recommend using <strong>SPACE</strong> when you
want an extra line space (or multiple thereof), and
<strong>ALD</strong> whenever you want some other value of space
after a line.

<strong>Experts: SPACE</strong> is an alias of <strong>sp</strong>.
You can use either, or mix 'n' match with impunity.

Sometimes, especially when in one of the

a macro will cause a break where you don't want one.  In order
to prevent this from happening (in other words, to join
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INPUTLINE">input lines</a>

<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_OUTPUTLINE">output line</a>),
use the groff
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INLINES">inline escape</a>
<strong>\c</strong> at the end of each input line to
be joined to another, like this:
<p>
<pre>
	.LEFT

	.FT R
	Some lines of text to be \c
	.FAMILY H
	.FT B
	joined \c
	.FAMILY T
	.FT R
	together.
</pre>

Upon output, the lines will be joined together to read
<p>
<pre>
	Some lines of text to be joined together.
</pre>

with the word &quot;joined&quot; in Helvetica bold.  Note the
space before <strong>\c</strong>.  Without it, the last three

Please also note that had the example been in one of the

there'd have been no need for the <strong>\c</strong>.  
<p>
<strong>Addendum:</strong> The example, above, is designed to
demonstrate the use of <strong>\c</strong>.  However, an easier and

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="WS"><h3><u>Word spacing</u></h3></a>
<br>
<nobr>Macro: <strong>WS</strong> &lt;+|-wordspace&gt; | DEFAULT</nobr>

<p>
<strong>WS</strong> (Word Space) increases or decreases the amount
of space between words.  In
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_NOFILL">nofill modes</a>,
or if
<a href="#QUAD">QUAD</a>
is in effect, the space between words is fixed.  Therefore, if you
change the word spacing with <strong>WS</strong>, the change applies
uniformly to the space between every word on every line.  However,
when text is
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_JUST">justified</a>,
the space between words varies from line to line (in order to justify
the text).  Consequently, the change you make with <strong>WS</strong>
represents the minimum (and ideal) space groff will try to put between
words before deciding whether to hyphenate a final word or to stretch
the word spacing.

<p>
Word space is relative to type size.  Knowing how it's calculated is
unimportant. What matters is having a sense of how the value passed
to <strong>WS</strong> affects the look of your type.  Generally,
in/decreasing the word space by a value of 1 or 2 produces a difference
that in many cases is scarcely visible; in/decreasing by a value of 5
or so produces a subtle but noticeable difference; and in/decreasing
by a value greater than 10 is always apparent.  You should preview
your work to assess the effect of <strong>WS</strong>.

<p>
<a name="WS_USAGE"><strong>WS</strong></a>
takes as its argument a whole number preceded by a plus or minus sign.
Therefore, to decrease the word space slightly, you might enter
<p>
<pre>
	.WS -4
</pre>

To increase it by a noticeable amount, you might enter
<p>
<pre>
	.WS +12
</pre>

You can reset the word spacing to its previous value by switching
the plus or minus sign, like this:
<p>
<pre>
	.WS +4
	A line of text
	.WS -4
</pre>

The <code>.WS -4</code> undoes the effect of <code>.WS
+4</code>.  You can also reset <strong>WS</strong> to
its groff default by entering
<p>
<pre>
	.WS DEFAULT
</pre>

This can be particularly useful if you've been playing around
with plus and minus values, and can't remember by how much you
have to in/decrease the word space to get it back to normal.
<p>

<!---SS--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="SS"><h3><u>Sentence space</u></h3></a>
<br>
<nobr>Macro: <strong>SS</strong> &lt;+sentence space&gt; | 0 | DEFAULT</nobr>

<p>
<strong>SS</strong> (Sentence Space) tells groff how to treat double
spaces it encounters between sentences in
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INPUTLINE">input lines</a>.
If you use <strong>SS</strong>, input sentences with two spaces
after them AND input sentences that fall at the end of input lines
all receive a normal word space plus an additional amount of space
whose size is determined by the + value passed as an argument to
<strong>SS</strong>.  Thus,
<p>
<pre>
	.SS +2
</pre>

means that input sentences with two spaces after them receive a normal
word space PLUS the +2 value passed to <strong>SS</strong>.
<p>
Like
<strong>WS</strong>, increasing the sentence space by a value of
1 or 2 produces a difference that in many cases is scarcely visible;
increasing by a value of 5 or so produces a subtle but noticeable
difference (i.e. the space between double-spaced input sentences will
be slightly but visibly greater than the space between words); and
increasing by a value greater than 10 is always apparent.  You should
preview your work to assess the effect of <strong>SS</strong>.
<p>
There's an additional argument you can pass <strong>SS</strong>:
the number zero (without the + sign).  It's the argument you'll
use most often.  Typeset copy should never have two spaces between
sentences, and the "zero" argument tells groff to give the extra
spaces no space at all (effectively removing them).  Therefore,
if you double-space your sentences (as you should when writing in a
text editor), get in the habit of putting
<p>
<pre>
	.SS 0
</pre>

at the top of your files.

<p>
If you do use <strong>SS</strong> for something other than ensuring
that you don't get unwanted sentence spaces in output copy, you
can set or reset the sentence space to the groff default (the same
width as a word space, i.e. double-spaced input sentences will appear
double-spaced on output as well) with
<p>
<pre>
	.SS DEFAULT
</pre>

If you're using the
<a href="docprocessing.html">document processing macros</a>
and your
<a href="docprocessing.html#PRINTSTYLE">PRINTSTYLE</a>
is <strong>TYPEWRITE</strong>, <code>.SS DEFAULT</code> is the default,
because you <em>do</em> want double spaces between sentences in copy
that imitates the look of a typewritten document.
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT: SS</strong> with an argument other than
&quot;0&quot; should only be used if you're of the old (and wise)
school of typists that puts two spaces between sentences.  If you
ignore this advice and use <strong>SS</strong> when you habitually
put only one space between sentences, you risk producing output where
the space between sentences is not equal.

<nobr>Macro: <strong>HY</strong> SPACE &lt;extra interword spacing to prevent hyphenation&gt;</nobr>
<br>
<nobr>Macro: <strong>HY</strong> DEFAULT</nobr>
<br>
Aliases: <strong>HYPHENATE, HYPHENATION</strong>

<p>
<strong>HY</strong>, as you can see, can be invoked with a number of
arguments.  In all cases, the aliases <strong>HYPHENATE</strong>
or <strong>HYPHENATION</strong> can be used in place of
<strong>HY</strong>.  To aid in understanding the various arguments
you can pass to <strong>HY</strong>, I've broken them down into
separate sections.

<h3><u>1. HY</u></h3>
<strong>HY</strong> by itself (i.e. with no argument) simply turns
automatic hyphenation on.  Any argument other than <strong>LINES,
MARGIN, SPACE</strong> or <strong>DEFAULT</strong>, turns automatic
hyphenation off.  For example, as explained in
<a href="intro.html#MACRO_ARGS">How to read macro arguments</a>,
you could turn <strong>HY</strong> off by entering
<p>
<pre>
	.HY OFF
	   or
	.HY X
	   or
	.HY END
</pre>

<strong>HY</strong> observes the following default hyphenation rules:
<br>
<ol>
	<li>Last lines (i.e. ones that will spring a trap--typically
	the last line on a page) will not be hyphenated.
	<li>The first and last two characters of a word are never
	split off.
</ol>

<h3><u>2. HY LINES</u></h3>
<strong>HY LINES</strong> sets the maximum number of consecutive
hyphenated lines that will appear in output copy.  2 is a very
good choice, and you'd set it with
<p>
<pre>
	.HY LINES 2
</pre>

By default, when you turn automatic hyphenation on, there is no
limit to the number of consecutive hyphenated lines.

<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong>
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_DISCRETIONARYHYPHEN">Discretionary hyphens</a>
count when groff is figuring out how many lines to hyphenate;
explicit hyphens do not.

<h3><u>3. HY MARGIN</u></h3>
<strong>HY MARGIN</strong> sets the amount of room allowed at
the end of a line before hyphenation is tripped (e.g. if there's
only 6 points left at the end of a line, groff won't try to hyphenate
the next word).  <strong>HY MARGIN</strong> only applies if you're
using
<a href="#QUAD">QUAD</a>, and is really only useful if you're
using <strong>QUAD LEFT</strong>.

<p>
As an example, if you don't want groff to hyphenate words when there's
only 18 points of space left at the end of a left-quadded line,
you'd enter
<p>
<pre>
	.HY MARGIN 18p
</pre>

<strong>NOTE:</strong> The numeric argument after <strong>HY
MARGIN</strong> requires a
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a>.

<h3><u>4. HY SPACE</u></h3>
<strong>HY SPACE</strong> sets an amount of extra interword
space that groff will <em>try</em> to put between words on a
line in order to PREVENT hyphenation.  <strong>HY SPACE</strong>
applies only to
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_JUST">justified lines</a>.  Generally speaking,
you'll want this value to be quite small, since too big a value
will result in lines with gaping holes between the words.  A reasonable
value might be half a point, or one point, which you'd set with
<p>
<pre>
	.HY SPACE .5p
	    or
	.HY SPACE 1p
</pre>

<strong>NOTE:</strong> The numeric argument after <strong>HY
SPACE</strong> requires a
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a>.

<h3><u>5. HY DEFAULT</u></h3>
<strong>HY DEFAULT</strong> resets automatic hyphenation to its
default behaviour, cancelling any changes made with <strong>LINES,
MARGIN,</strong> and/or <strong>SPACE</strong>.

<h3><u>A note on hyphenation in general</u></h3>
Hyphenation is a necessary evil.  If it can be avoided, it should be.
If it can't be, it should occur infrequently.  That's the reason for
the number of parameters you can set with <strong>HY</strong>.

<p>
Furthermore, hyphenation in
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_RAG">rag</a>
copy requires a great deal of attention.  At best, it should be
avoided completely by individually adjusting the number of words
on consecutive lines to achieve a pleasing, natural-looking rag.  
Since such adjustments are often too fussy for document
processing, I recommend playing around with <strong>HY MARGIN</strong>
a bit if your copy looks hyphen-heavy.
<p>

<!---HY_SET--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">

<br>
<nobr>Macro: <strong>HY_SET</strong> &lt;lines&gt; [ &lt;margin&gt; [ &lt;space&gt; ] ]</nobr>
<br>
Alias: <strong>HYSET</strong>

<p>
<strong>HY_SET</strong> lets you set the parameters for hyphenation
with a single macro.  &lt;lines&gt;, &lt;margin&gt; and &lt;space&gt;
correspond to the numeric values required by
<strong>LINES</strong>, <strong>MARGIN</strong> and
<strong>SPACE</strong> as described
<a href="#HY">above</a>.

<p>
To set just the maximum number of consecutive hyphenated lines,
you'd enter
<p>
<pre>
	.HY_SET 2
</pre>

If you wanted the same number of maximum consecutive hyphenated lines
and a hyphenation margin for use with
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_RAG">rag</a>
copy,
<p>
<pre>
	.HY_SET 2 36p
</pre>

would set the hyphenation margin to 36 points.

<p>
If you wanted the same number of maximum consecutive hyphenated
lines and a hyphenation space of 2 points for use with
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_JUST">justified</a>
copy, 
<p>
<pre>
	.HYSET 2 0 2p

<nobr>Macro: <strong>RW</strong> &lt;amount of whitespace reduction between letters&gt;</nobr>

<p>
<strong>RW</strong> (Reduce Whitespace) and its corresponding macro,
<strong>EW</strong> (Expand Whitespace), allow you to tighten
(or loosen)
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_OUTPUTLINE">output lines</a>
by uniformly reducing or expanding the space between characters.
This is particularly useful when you want to squeeze or stretch
lines on a narrow measure.

<p>
The value passed to <strong>RW</strong> may be a whole number or a
decimal fraction.  Since a value of 1 produces a noticeable reduction
in the space between letters at text sizes, you'll most likely use
small decimal values when tightening lines.  For example,
<p>
<pre>
	.RW .1
	  or
	.RW .2
</pre>

may be just enough to squeeze an extra character or two on a
line without the change in letter spacing being obvious.  I
highly recommend previewing your work to assess the effect of
<strong>RW</strong>.

<p>
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> In versions prior to 1.1.9-a,
<strong>RW</strong> affected all
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FONT">fonts</a>
in the
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FAMILY">family</a>

has been changed.  <strong>RW</strong> affects only the font
current at the time it's invoked, and remains in effect for that
font every time the font is called, hence must be reset to zero to
cancel its effect (<code>.RW 0</code>) on that font.
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> By default, <strong>RW</strong> does not deposit a

<nobr>Macro: <strong>SETBOLDER</strong> &lt;amount of emboldening, in machine units&gt; | RESET</nobr>

<p>
Emboldening of type is accomplished by printing characters
twice; the second printing is slightly offset from the first,
effectively &quot;thickening&quot; the character.
<strong>SETBOLDER</strong> lets you set the number of
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITS">machine units</a>

produces an acceptable approximation of a bold font.  If you want
another value -- say, 500 units -- you'd set it by entering
<p>
<pre>

<strong>CONDENSE</strong> tells <strong>mom</strong> what

Pseudo-extending of type is accomplished by increasing the width of
characters at a given point size without increasing their height,
effectively widening them so they look like extended type.
<strong>EXTEND</strong> tells <strong>mom</strong> what
percentage of the normal character width you want the characters

<a name="INTRO_TABS"></a>

<a name="TABS">
	<h2><u>Tabs</u></h2>
</a>

<strong>Mom</strong> provides two different kinds of tab setup:
typesetting tabs and string tabs.  Neither one has anything to
do with the tab key on your keyboard, and both are utterly
divorced from groff's notion of tabs.  I recommend reading this
section carefully in order to understand how
<strong>mom</strong> handles tabs.
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> see the section
<a href="typemacdoc.html#TYPESETTING">Using typesetting macros during document processing</a>
for re-assuring information on the use of tabs during
<a href="docprocessing.html#DOCPROCESSING">document processing</a>.
<p>

<a name="TYPESETTING_TABS"><h3><u>Typesetting tabs</u></h3></a>
<p>
Typesetting tabs are defined by both an indent from the left margin and
a line length.  This is quite different from typewriter-style tab stops
(the groff norm) that only define the left indent.  In conjunction
with the
<a href="#MULTI_COLUMNS">multi-column macros</a>,
typesetting tabs significantly facilitate
tabular and columnar work.
<p>
Typesetting tabs are created with the
<a href="#TAB_SET">TAB_SET</a>
macro. <strong>TAB_SET</strong> identifies the tab (by number),
establishes its left indent and line length, and optionally sets
a quad direction and fill mode.  After tabs have been created with
<strong>TAB_SET</strong>, they can be called at any time with the
<a href="#TAB">TAB</a>
macro.
<p>

<a name="TYPESETTING_TABS_TUT"><h3><u>Quickie tutorial on typesetting tabs</u></h3></a>
<p>
Say you want to set up three tabs to produce an employee evaluation
that looks something like this:
<p>
<a name="TYPSETTING_TABS_SAMPLE"></a>
<pre>
	CRITERION       EVALUATION     COMMENTS

	Service           Good         Many clients specifically request
	                               support from Joe by name.

	Punctuality    Satisfactory    Tends to arrive after 8:00am, but
	                               often works through lunch hour.

	Team spirit     Needs work     Persistently gives higher priority
	                               to helping clients than respecting
	                               organizational hierarchy.
</pre>

You want the first tab (&quot;CRITERION&quot;)
<br>
<ul>
	<li>to begin at the left margin of the page (i.e. no indent)
	<li>to have a line length of 5 picas
	<li>to be set flush left
</ul>
<br>
Tabs must be numbered, and each has to be set up with a separate
<a href="#TAB_SET">TAB_SET</a>
line.  Therefore, to set up tab 1, you enter
<p>
<pre>
   .TAB_SET  1  0  5P  L
             |  |  |   |
      tab #__|  |  |   |__direction
                |  |
        indent__|  |__length
</pre>

You want the second tab (&quot;EVALUATION&quot;)
<br>
<ul>
	<li>to begin 8 picas from the left margin
	<li>to have a length of 9 picas
	<li>to be set centred.
</ul>
<br>
You set it up like this:
<p>
<pre>
   .TAB_SET  2  8P  9P  C
             |  |   |   |
      tab #__|  |   |   |__direction
                |   |
        indent__|   |__length
</pre>

You want the third tab (&quot;COMMENTS&quot;)
<br>
<ul>
	<li>to begin 19 picas from the left margin
	<li>to have a length of 17 picas
	<li>to be set flush left, <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FILLED">filled</a>
</ul>
<br>
The setup looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
   .TAB_SET  3  19P  17P  L  QUAD
             |   |    |   |    |
             |   |    |   |    |__fill output lines
             |   |    |   |
      tab #__|   |    |   |__direction
                 |    |
         indent__|    |__length
</pre>

Once the tabs are set up, you can call them in one of two ways:
<br>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#TAB">TAB</a> (with the tab
		number as an argument) breaks the current line,
		advances one linespace, and calls the tab.
	<li><a href="#TN">TN</a> (Tab Next) keeps
		you on the current line and moves over to the next
		tab in sequence (i.e. from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, etc.).
</ul>
<br>
To exit from tabs and restore your original left margin, line length,
quad direction and fill mode,  use
<a href="#TQ">TQ</a>
(Tab Quit).
<p>
Here's how the input for our sample employee evaluation looks
(with some introductory parameters):
<p>
<pre>
	.PAGE 8.5i 11i 1i 1i 1i
	.FAMILY  T
	.FT      R
	.PT_SIZE 14
	.LS      16
	.QUAD    LEFT
	.KERN
	.HY OFF
	.SS 0
	.TAB_SET 1 0   5P  L
	.TAB_SET 2 8P  9P  C
	.TAB_SET 3 19P 17P L QUAD
	.TAB 1
	CRITERION
	.TN
	EVALUATION
	.TN
	COMMENTS
	.SP
	.TAB 1
	Service
	.TN
	Good
	.TN
	Many clients specifically request support from Joe by name.
	.SP
	.TAB 1
	Punctuality
	.TN
	Satisfactory
	.TN
	Tends to arrive after 8:00am, but often works through lunch hour.
	.SP
	.TAB 1
	Team spirit
	.TN
	Needs work
	.TN
	Persistently gives higher priority to helping clients
	than respecting organizational hierarchy.
	.TQ
</pre>

Try setting this up and previewing it with
<p>
<pre>
	groff -mom -X &lt;filename&gt;
</pre>

Notice how <kbd>.TN</kbd> simply moves over to the next tab,
while the combination <kbd>.SP/.TAB 1</kbd> breaks the
line, advances by one extra linespace, and calls the first tab.
<p>
Notice, too, how the <kbd>QUAD</kbd> argument passed to
tab 3 means you don't have to worry about the length of
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INPUTLINE">input lines</a>;
<strong>mom</strong>
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FILLED">fills</a>
the tab and sets the type flush left.
<p>
<a name="STRING_TABS"><h3><u>String tabs (autotabs)</u></h3></a>
<p>
String tabs let you mark off tab positions with
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INLINES">inline escapes</a>
embedded in
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INPUTLINE">input lines</a>.
Left indents and line lengths are calculated from the beginning and
end positions of the marks.  This is especially useful when tab
indents and lengths need to be determined from the text that goes in
each tab.
<p>
Setting up string tabs is a two-step procedure.  First, you enter an
input line in which you mark off where you want tabs to begin and end.
(This is often best done in conjunction with the
<a href="goodies.html#SILENT">SILENT</a>
macro.)
<p>
Next, you invoke the
<a href="#ST">ST</a>
macro for every string tab you defined, and optionally pass quad and
fill information to it.  That done, string tabs are called with
the
<a href="#TAB">TAB</a>
macro, just like typesetting tabs.
<p>
In combination with the
<a href="goodies.html#PAD">PAD</a>
macro and the groff inline escape
<a href="inlines.html#INLINE_HORIZONTAL_GROFF">\h</a>
(move horizontally across the page) or <strong>mom</strong>'s
<a href="inlines.html#INLINE_HORIZONTAL_MOM">\*[FWD &lt;distance&gt;]</a>
(move forward) inline, string tabs provide
tremendous flexibility in setting up complex tab structures.
<p>
<a name="STRING_TABS_TUT"><h3><u>Quickie tutorial on string tabs</u></h3></a>
<p>
Say you want to set up tabs for the
<a href="#TYPSETTING_TABS_SAMPLE">employee evaluation form</a>
used as an example in the
<a href="#TYPESETTING_TABS_TUT">typesetting tabs tutorial</a>.
This time, though, you want to play around with the point size of
type, so you can't know exactly how long the tabs will be or where
they should start.  All you know is
<br>
<ul>
	<li>CRITERION is the longest line in tab 1
	<li>EVALUATION is the longest line in tab 2
	<li>tab 3 should extend to the current right margin
	<li>you want a 1 pica gutter between each tab
</ul>
<br>
This is an ideal job for string tabs.
<p>
The first thing you need for string tabs is an
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INPUTLINE">input line</a>
with tab positions marked on it.  Tabs are marked with the
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INLINES">inline escapes</a>
<a href="#ST_INLINE">\*[ST&lt;n&gt;]</a>
and
<a href="#ST_INLINE">\*[ST&lt;n&gt;X]</a>,
where <strong>&lt;n&gt;</strong>
is the number you want the tab to have.  (In this example, we
enclose the input line with the
<a href="goodies.html#SILENT">SILENT</a>
macro so the line doesn't print.  We also use the
<a href="goodies.html#PAD">PAD</a>
macro to permit defining tab 3 as simply &quot;the amount of
space remaining on the input line.&quot;)
<p>
The setup looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
	.SILENT
	.PAD "\*[ST1]CRITERION\*[ST1X]\*[FWD 12p]\*[ST2]EVALUATION\*[ST2X]\*[FWD 12p]\*[ST3]#\*[ST3X]"
	.SILENT OFF
</pre>

The long line after <kbd>.PAD</kbd> looks scary, but it isn't.
Here's what it means when broken down into its component parts:
<br>
<ul>
	<li>The longest line in tab 1 is &quot;CRITERION&quot;, so we
		enclose CRITERION with begin/end markers for string tab 1:
		<p>
		<kbd>\*[ST1]CRITERION\*[ST1X]</kbd>
		<br>
	<li>We want a 1 pica (12 points) gutter between tab 1 and 2,
		so we insert 12 points of space with \*[FWD 12p]
		(<strong>F</strong>or<strong>W</strong>ar<strong>D</strong> 12 points):
		<p>
		<kbd>\*[FWD 12p]</kbd>
		<br>
	<li>The longest line in tab 2 is &quot;EVALUATION&quot;, so
		we enclose EVALUATION with begin/end markers for string
		tab 2:
		<p>
		<kbd>\*[ST2]EVALUATION\*[ST2X]</kbd>
		<br>
	<li>We want 1 pica (12 points) between tab 2 and 3, so we
		insert 12 points of space with another \*[FWD 12p]:
		<p>
		<kbd>\*[FWD 12p]</kbd>
		<br>
	<li>We want tab 3 to be as long as whatever space remains on
		the current line length, so we enclose the
		<a href="goodies.html#PAD_MARKER">pad marker</a>
		(#) with begin/end markers for string tab 3:
		<p>
		<kbd>\*[ST3]#\*[ST3X]</kbd>
		<br>
</ul>
<br>
The tabs are now defined, but they require
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_QUAD">quad direction</a>
and
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FILLED">fill</a>
information.  For each string tab defined above, enter a
separate
<a href="#ST">ST</a>
line, like this:
<p>
<pre>
	.ST  1  L
	.ST  2  L
	.ST  3  L  QUAD
	     |  |   |

From here on in, you call the tabs with
<a href="#TAB">TAB</a>
and
<a href="#TN">TN</a>
just like typesetting tabs (see
<a href="#TYPESETTING_TABS_TUT">typesetting tabs tutorial</a>).
<p>
Here's the complete setup and entry for the sample employee

Try setting this up and previewing it with
<p>
<pre>
	groff -mom -X &lt;filename&gt;
</pre>

Now, change the point size of the above sample to 12 and preview
it again.  You'll see that the tab structure remains identical (tab
1=CRITERION, tab 2=EVALUATION, tab 3=space remaining, and the gutter
between tabs is still 1 pica), while the position and length 
of the tabs have altered because of the new point size.
<p>
Now try increasing the gutters to 2 picas (<kbd>\*[FWD 24p]</kbd> or
<kbd>\*[FWD 2P]</kbd> instead of <kbd>\*[FWD 12p]</kbd>).  Preview the
file again, and notice how the tab structure remains the same, but
the gutters are wider.

<nobr>Macro: <strong>TAB_SET</strong> &lt;tab number&gt; &lt;indent&gt; &lt;length&gt;  L | R | C | J [ QUAD ]</nobr>
<br>
<em>*&lt;indent&gt; and &lt;length&gt; require a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
<strong>TAB_SET</strong> creates typesetting tabs that later can be
called with
<a href="#TAB">TAB</a>.
Typesetting tabs are numbered, and defined by an indent, a length,
and a &quot;direction&quot;, hence <strong>TAB_SET</strong> has
four required arguments:
<br>
<ul>
	<li>a tab number
	<li>an indent (measured from the left margin of the page,
	or, if you're already in a tab, from the left margin of the tab)
	<li>a length
	<li>a direction
</ul>
<br>
To set up a centred tab 6 picas long and 9 points from the left
margin, you'd enter
<p>
<pre>
	.TAB_SET 1 9p 6P C
</pre>

The tab number in the above (&quot;1&quot;) is simply an
identifier.  It could have been 4, or 17, or 296.  There's no
need to set up tabs in numerical sequence.
<p>
By default, tabs are in
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_NOFILL">nofill</a>
mode, meaning you can enter text in tabs on a line-for-line basis
without having to use the
<a href="#BR">BR</a>
macro.  If you want a tab to be
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FILLED">filled</a>,
pass the optional argument <strong>QUAD</strong>, which will
make the tab behave as if you'd entered <kbd>.QUAD L | R |
C</kbd>.
<p>
For
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_JUST">justified</a>
tabs, simply pass the argument <strong>J</strong> (without the
<strong>QUAD</strong> argument), like this:
<p>
<pre>
	.TAB 1 9p 6P J
</pre>

Once tabs are set, they can be called at any time with the
<a href="#TAB">TAB #</a>
macro, where &quot;#&quot; is the number of the desired tab.
<p>
You can set up any number of typesetting tabs.  However, be
aware that
<a href="#STRING_TABS">string tabs</a>
are also called with <strong>TAB #</strong>, so be careful that you
don't set up a typesetting tab numbered, say, 4, when you already
have a string tab numbered 4.  Every tab, typesetting or string,
must have a unique numeric identifier.
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you use <strong>TAB_SET</strong> while
you're currently inside a tab, the indent argument is the distance from
the tab's left margin, not the left margin of the page.  Therefore,
you should exit tabs (with
<a href="#TQ">TQ</a>)
before creating new tabs (unless, of course, you want to set
up a tab structure within the confines of an existing tab).
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Turn all indents off (see
<a href="#INDENTS">Indents</a>)
before setting up tabs with <strong>TAB_SET</strong>, or
<strong>mom</strong> may get confused.

Please see
<a href="#IMPORTANT">IMPORTANT</a>,
below.</em>
<p>
String tabs need to be marked off with
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INLINES">inline escapes</a>
before being set up with the
<a href="#ST">ST</a>
macro.  Any input line may contain string tab markers.
<i>&lt;number&gt;</i>, above, means the numeric identifier of
the tab.  The following shows a sample input line with string
tab markers.
<p>
<pre>
	\*[ST1]Now is the time\*[ST1X] for all \*[ST2]good men\*ST2X] to come to the aid of the party.
</pre>

String tab 1 begins at the start of the line and ends after the word
&quot;time&quot;.  String tab 2 starts at &quot;good&quot; and ends
after &quot;men&quot;.  Inline escapes (e.g. font or point size
changes, or horizontal movements, including
<a href="goodies.html#PAD">padding</a>)
are taken into account when <strong>mom</strong> determines the
position and length of string tabs.
<p>
Up to nineteen string tabs may be marked (not necessarily all on
the same line, of course), and they must be numbered between 1
and 19.
<p>
Once string tabs have been marked in input lines, they have to
be &quot;set&quot; with
<a href="#ST">ST</a>,
after which they may be called, by number, with
<a href="#TAB">TAB</a>.
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Lines with string tabs marked off in them
are normal input lines, i.e. they get printed, just like any
input line.  If you want to set up string tabs without the line
printing, use the
<a href="#SILENT">SILENT</a>
macro.
<p>
<a name="IMPORTANT"><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong></a>
Owing to the way groff processes
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INPUTLINE">input lines</a>
and turns them into
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_OUTPUTLINE">output lines</a>,
it is not possible for <strong>mom</strong> to &quot;guess&quot; the
correct starting position of string tabs marked off in lines that
are centered or set flush right.
<p>
Equally, she cannot guess the starting position if a line is fully
justified and broken with
<a href="#SPREAD">SPREAD</a>.
<p>
In other words, in order to use string tabs,
<a href="#LRC">LEFT</a>
must be active, or, if
<a href="#QUAD">QUAD LEFT</a>
or
<a href="#JUSTIFY">JUSTIFY</a>
are active, the line on which the string tabs are marked must be
broken &quot;manually&quot; with
<a href="#BR">BR</a>
(but not
<a href="#SPREAD">SPREAD</a>).
<p>
To circumvent this behaviour, I recommend using the
<a href="goodies.html#PAD">PAD</a>
to set up string tabs in centered or flush right lines.  Say, for
example, you want to use a string tab to underscore the text of a
centered line with a rule.  Rather than this,
<p>
<pre>
	.CENTER
	\*[ST1]A line of text\*[ST1X]\c
	.EL
	.ST 1
	.TAB 1
	.PT_SIZE 24
	.ALD 3p
	\*[RULE]
	.RLD 3p
	.TQ
</pre>

you should do:
<p>
<pre>
	.QUAD CENTER
	.PAD "#\*[ST1]A line of text\*[ST1X]#"
	.EL
	.ST 1
	.TAB 1
	.PT_SIZE 24
	.ALD 3p
	\*[RULE] \" Note that you can't use \*[UP ] or \*[DOWN] with \*[RULE]
	.RLD 3p
	.TQ

<!---ST--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
	<a name="ST"><h3><u>Set string tabs</u></h3></a>
<br>
<nobr>Macro: <strong>ST</strong> &lt;tab number&gt;  L | R | C | J [ QUAD ]</nobr>

<p>
After string tabs have been marked off on an input line (see
<a href="#INLINE_ST">\*[ST]...\*[STX]</a>),
you need to &quot;set&quot; them by giving them a direction
and, optionally, the <strong>QUAD</strong> argument.  In this
respect, <strong>ST</strong> is like
<a href="#TAB_SET">TAB_SET</a>
except that you don't have to give <strong>ST</strong> an indent
or a line length (that's already taken care of, inline, by
<kbd>\*[ST]...\*[STX]</kbd>).  If you want string tab 1 to be
left, enter
<p>
<pre>
	.ST 1 L
</pre>

If you want it to be left and
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FILLED">filled</a>, enter
<p>
<pre>
	.ST 1 L QUAD
</pre>

If you want it to be justified, enter
<p>
<pre>
	.ST 1 J
</pre>

See the
<a href="#STRING_TABS_TUT">Quickie tutorial on string tabs</a>
for a full explanation of setting up string tabs.

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="TAB"><h3><u>Call tabs</u></h3></a>
<br>
<nobr>Macro: <strong>TAB</strong> &lt;tab number&gt;</nobr>
<br>
Alias: <strong>TB</strong>
<p>
After tabs have been defined (either with
<a href="#TAB_SET">TAB_SET</a>
or
<a href="#ST">ST</a>),
<strong>TAB</strong> moves to whatever tab number you pass it as
an argument.  For example,
<p>
<pre>
	.TAB 3
</pre>

moves you to tab 3.
<p>
<a name="NOTE_TN"></a>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> <strong>TAB</strong> breaks the line preceding
it and advances 1 linespace.  Hence,
<p>
<pre>
	.TAB 1
	A line of text in tab 1.
	.TAB 2
	A line of text in tab 2.
</pre>

produces, on output
<p>
<pre>
	A line of text in tab 1.
	                           A line of text in tab 2.
</pre>

If you want the tabs to line up, use
<a href="#TN">TN</a>
(Tab Next), like this:
<p>
<pre>
	.TAB 1
	A line of text in tab 1.
	.TN
	A line of text in tab 2.
</pre>

which produces
<p>
<pre>
	A line of text in tab 1.   A line of text in tab 2.
</pre>

If the text in your tabs runs to several lines, and you want the
first lines of each tab to align, you must use the
<a href="#MULTI_COLUMNS">multi-column</a> macros.
<p>
<strong>ADDITIONAL NOTE:</strong> Any indents in effect prior to
calling a tab are automatically turned off by <strong>TAB</strong>.
If you were happily zipping down the page with a left indent of 2
picas turned on, and you call a tab whose indent from the left margin
is 6 picas, your new distance from the left margin will be 6 picas,
not 6 picas plus the 2 pica indent.
<p>

<!---TN--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="TN"><h3><u>Tab Next</u></h3></a>
<br>
Macro: <strong>TN</strong>
<br>
<em>*In tabs that aren't given the QUAD argument when they're set up
with
<a href="#TAB_SET">TAB_SET</a>
or
<a href="#ST">ST</a>, you must terminate the line preceding
<kbd>TN</kbd> with the \c inline escape.  See the
<a href="#TN_NOTE">ADDITIONAL NOTE</a>,
<br>
*If you find remembering whether to put in the <kbd>\c</kbd>
bothersome, you may prefer to use the
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INLINES">inline escape</a>
alternative to 
<kbd>.TN</kbd>,
<a href="inlines.html#TB+">\*[TB+]</a>,
which works consistently regardless of the fill mode.</em>

<p>
<strong>TN</strong> moves over to the next tab in numeric
sequence (tab n+1) without advancing on the page.  See the
<a href="#NOTE_TN">NOTE</a>
in the description of the <strong>TAB</strong> macro for an
example of how <strong>TN</strong> works.
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> You <em>must</em> put text in the
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INPUTLINE">input line</a>
immediately after <strong>TN</strong>. &quot;Stacking&quot; of
<strong>TN</strong>'s is not allowed.  In other words, you cannot
do
<p>
<pre>
	.TAB 1
	Some text
	.TN
	Some more text
	.TN
	.TN
	Yet more text
</pre>

The above example, assuming tabs numbered from 1 to 4, should be entered
<p>
<pre>
	.TAB 1
	Some text
	.TN
	Some more text
	.TAB 4
	Yet more text
</pre>
<p>
<a name="TN_NOTE"><strong>ADDITIONAL NOTE:</strong></a>
In versions of mom prior to 1.1.9, <strong>TN</strong> did not
always work as advertised on the last
<a name="TERMS_OUTPUTLINE">output line</a>
of pages that contained a footer trap (e.g. one set with
<a href="#B_MARGIN">B_MARGIN</a>
or in  documents formatted using the
<a href="docprocessing.html#DOCPROCESSING">document processing macros</a>).
<p>
<strong>TN</strong> has been re-written so that this should no longer be the
case.  However, in order for it to work in tabs that have not been
given a <kbd>QUAD</kbd> argument (see
<a href="#TAB_SET">TAB_SET</a>
and
<a href="#ST">ST</a>)
you must always &quot;join&quot; <strong>.TN</strong> to the line
before it using the
<a href="#JOIN">\c</a>
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INLINES">inline escape</a>,
as in the following example:
<p>
<pre>
	.TAB_SET 1 0  1P  L
	.TAB_SET 2 1P 20P L
	.TAB 1
	1.\c
	.TN
	The first rule of survival is &quot;make and keep good friends.&quot;
</pre>

When output, the example will look like this:
<p>
<pre>
	1.  The first rule of survival is &quot;make and keep good friends.&quot;
</pre>

Conversely, if you did give a <kbd>QUAD</kbd> argument
to <strong>TAB_SET</strong> or <strong>ST</strong>, the
<strong>\c</strong> must not be used.

<!====================================================================>

<a name="INTRO_MULTI_COLUMNS"></a>

<a name="MULTI_COLUMNS">
	<h2><u>Multi-Columns</u></h2>
</a>

Tabs are not by nature columnar, which is to say that if the text
inside a tab runs to several lines, calling another tab does not
automatically move to the
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_BASELINE">baseline</a>
of the first line in the previous tab.  To demonstrate:
<p>
<pre>
	.TAB 1
	Carrots
	Potatoes
	Broccoli
	.TAB 2
	$1.99/5 lbs
	$0.25/lb
	$0.99/bunch
</pre>

produces, on output
<p>
<pre>
	Carrots
	Potatoes
	Broccoli
	           $1.99/5 lbs
	           $0.25/lb
	           $0.99/bunch
</pre>

The multi-column macros allow you to set tabs in columnar
fashion, rather than line by line.  When you invoke multi-column
mode (with
<a href="#MCO">MCO</a>),
<strong>mom</strong> saves the position of the current baseline.
<a href="#MCR">MCR</a>
(Multi-column return) at any point while multi-columns are on
returns you to the saved position.  Exiting multi-columns
(<a href="#MCX">MCX</a>)
quits the current tab (if you're in one) and moves you to the
bottom of the longest column.  (Note that you do not have to use
multi-columns in conjunction with tabs.)
<p>
Using our example above, but setting it in multi-column mode,
<p>
<pre>
	.MCO
	.TAB 1
	Carrots
	Potatoes
	Broccoli
	.MCR
	.TAB 2
	$1.99/5 lbs
	$0.25/lb

an extra 6 points below where <strong>MCX</strong> would

<a name="INTRO_INDENTS"></a>

<a name="INDENTS">
	<h2><u>Indents</u></h2>
</a>

With <strong>mom</strong>'s indents, you can indent from the left,
the right, or both margins.  In addition, <strong>mom</strong>
provides temporary left indents (i.e. only one line is indented,
as at the start of a paragraph) and &quot;hanging&quot; left indents
(the reverse of a temporary indent; the first line isn't indented,
subsequent lines are).
<p>
<a name="INDENTS_TUT"><h3><u>A brief explanation of how mom handles indents</u></h3></a>
<p>
<strong>Mom</strong> provides five kinds of indents: left, right,
both, temporary, and hanging.  Each is invoked by its own name:
<br>
<ul>
	<li><strong>IL</strong> = <strong>I</strong>ndent <strong>L</strong>eft
	<li><strong>IR</strong> = <strong>I</strong>ndent <strong>R</strong>ight
	<li><strong>IB</strong> = <strong>I</strong>ndent <strong>B</strong>oth
	<li><strong>HI</strong> = <strong>H</strong>anging <strong>I</strong>ndent
	<li><strong>TI</strong> = <strong>T</strong>emporary <strong>I</strong>ndent
</ul>
<br>
In addition, there are four macros to control exiting from
indents:
<br>
<ul>
	<li><strong>IQ</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;= quit all active indents
	<li><strong>ILX</strong>&nbsp;= exit indent style left
	<li><strong>IRX</strong>&nbsp;= exit indent style right
	<li><strong>IBX</strong>&nbsp;= exit indent style both
</ul>
<br>
This section deals exclusively with <strong>IL, IR</strong> and
<strong>IB</strong>.  For an explanation
of hanging and temporary indents -- how they work and how to use
them -- see
<a href="#HI">Hanging indents</a>
and
<a href="#TI">Temporary indents</a>.
<p>
The first time you invoke any of <strong>mom</strong>'s indents,
you must supply a measure.  For example,
<p>
<pre>
	.IL 2P
</pre>

indents text 2 picas from the left margin (or current tab
indent).
<p>
When you want to exit the above indent, use either
<p>
<pre>
	.IQ
	 or
	.ILX
</pre>

The next time you want the same indent, invoke it without the
argument, like this:
<p>
<pre>
	.IL
</pre>

As you can see, once you've supplied a measure to an indent macro
<strong>mom</strong> stores the value, obviating the need to repeat
it on subsequent invocations.  And <strong>mom</strong> doesn't just
store the measure -- she hangs on to it tenaciously.  Arguments passed
to <strong>IL, IR</strong> and <strong>IB</strong> are additive.
Consider the following:
<p>
<pre>
	.LL 20P
	.IR 2P    \"Indent right by 2 picas
	A first block of text...
	...
	...
	.IQ       \"Turn indent off
	A second block of text...
	...
	...
	.IR 2P    \"Indent right by an additional 2 picas (i.e. 4 picas)
	A third block of text...
	...
	...
</pre>

The first block of text is right indented by 2 picas (i.e. the line
length is shortened by 2 picas to 18 picas).  The second block of
text, after <strong>IQ</strong>, is, as you'd expect, set to the full
measure.  The third block of text -- the one to pay attention to --
is not right indented by 2 picas, but rather by 4 picas.
<strong>Mom</strong> adds the value of arguments to <strong>IL,
IR</strong> and <strong>IB</strong> to whatever value is already
in effect. 
<p>
If you wanted the third block of text in the example above to
be right indented by just 2 picas (the original measure given to
<strong>IR</strong>), you would enter <kbd>.IR</kbd> without an
argument.
<p>
Because indent arguments are additive, putting a minus sign in front
of the argument can be used to subtract from the current value.
In the following example, the first line is indented 18 points, the
second is indented 36 points (18+18), and the third is again indented
18 points (36-18).
<p>
<pre>
	.IL 18p     \"Indent left by 18 points      = 18 points
	Now is the time
	.IL 18p     \"Indent left by 18 points more = 36 points
	for all good men to come
	.IL -18p    \"Indent left by 18 points less = 18 points
	to the aid of the party.
</pre>

Sometimes, you may want to clear out the stored indent values -- let
<strong>mom</strong> start indenting with a clean slate, as it were.
Giving the optional argument <kbd>CLEAR</kbd> to any of the
&quot;indent quit&quot; macros resets them to zero.
<br>
<ul>
	<li><strong>IQ CLEAR</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;= quit and clear all indents
	<li><strong>ILX CLEAR</strong>&nbsp;= quit and clear indent style left
	<li><strong>IRX CLEAR</strong>&nbsp;= quit and clear indent style right
	<li><strong>IBX CLEAR</strong>&nbsp;= quit and clear indent style both
</ul>
<br>
Indent styles may be combined and manipulated separately.  You could,
for example, have a left indent of 4 picas and a right indent of 6
picas and control each separately, as in the following example.
<p>
<pre>
	.IL 4P     \"Indent left 4 picas
	.IR 6P     \"Indent right 6 picas
	Some text
	.IRX       \"Turn off the right indent only
	More text  \"Text is still indented 4 picas left
</pre>

If, at <kbd>.IRX</kbd>, you wanted the text afterwards to have no
indents (either left or right), you would enter <kbd>.IQ</kbd>,
which exits all indent styles at once.
<p>
<strong>A word of advice:</strong> Indents are best used only when
you have a compelling reason not to change the current left margin or
line length.  In many instances where indents might seem expedient,
it's better to use tabs, or actually change the left margin or the
line length.  <strong>Mom</strong>'s indenting macros are flexible
and powerful, but easy to get tangled up in.  Personally, I don't
use them much, except for cutarounds and multi-level lists à la html,
at which they excel.

<a name="IL"><h3><u>Indent left</u></h3></a>
<br>
<nobr>Macro: <strong>IL</strong> [ &lt;measure&gt; ]</nobr>
<br>
<em>*The optional argument requires a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
<strong>IL</strong> indents text from the left margin of the page,
or if you're in a tab, from the left edge of the tab.  Once
<strong>IL</strong> is on, the left indent is applied uniformly to
every subsequent line of text, even if you change the line length.
<p>
The first time you invoke <strong>IL</strong>, you must give it a
measure.  Subsequent invocations with a measure add to the previous
measure.  A minus sign may be prepended to the argument to subtract
from the current measure.  The
<a href="inlines.html#INLINE_STRINGWIDTH_GROFF">\w</a>
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INLINES">inline escape</a>
may be used to specify a text-dependent measure, in which case
no unit of measure is required.  For example,
<p>
<pre>
	.IL \w'margarine'
</pre>

indents text by the width of the word &quot;margarine&quot;.
<p>
With no argument, <strong>IL</strong> indents by its last
active value.  See the
<a href="#INDENTS_TUT">brief explanation of how mom handles indents</a>
for more details.
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Calling a tab (with
<a href="#TAB">TAB</a>)
automatically cancels any active indents.

<p>
The first time you invoke <strong>IR</strong>, you must give it a

<br>
<em>*The optional arguments require a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
<strong>IB</strong> allows you to set or invoke a left and a right
indent at the same time.
<p>
At its first invocation, you must supply a measure for both indents;
at subsequent invocations when you wish to supply a measure, both must
be given again.  As with <strong>IL</strong> and <strong>IR</strong>,
the measures are added to the values previously passed to the macro.
Hence, if you wish to change just one of the values, you must
give an argument of zero to the other.
<p>
<strong>A word of advice:</strong> If you need to manipulate left and
right indents separately, use a combination of <strong>IL</strong>
and <strong>IR</strong> instead of <strong>IB</strong>.  You'll
save yourself a lot of grief.
<p>
A minus sign may be prepended to the arguments to subtract from their
current values.  The
<a href="inlines.html#INLINE_STRINGWIDTH_GROFF">\w</a>
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INLINES">inline escape</a>

<!---TI--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="TI"><h3><u>Temporary (left) indent</u></h3></a>
<br>
<nobr>Macro: <strong>TI</strong> [ &lt;measure&gt; ]</nobr>
<br>
<em>*The optional argument requires a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
A temporary indent is one that applies only to the first line of
text that comes after it.  Its chief use is indenting the first
line of paragraphs.  (<strong>Mom</strong>'s
<a href="docprocessing.html#PP">PP</a>
macro, for example, uses a temporary indent.)
<p>
The first time you invoke <strong>TI</strong>, you must give it
a measure.  If you want to indent the first line of a
paragraph by, say, 2
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_EM">ems</a>,
do
<p>
<pre>
	.TI 2m
</pre>

Subsequent invocations of <strong>TI</strong> do not require you
to supply a measure; <strong>mom</strong> keeps track of the
last measure you gave it.
<p>
Because temporary indents are temporary, there's no need to turn
them off.
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Unlike <strong>IL, IR</strong> and
<strong>IB</strong>, measures given to <strong>TI</strong>
are NOT additive.  In the following example, the second <kbd>.TI
2P</kbd> is exactly 2 picas.
<p>
<pre>
	.TI 1P
	The beginning of a paragraph...
	.TI 2P
	The beginning of another paragraph...
</pre>

<!---HI--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="HI"><h3><u>Hanging indent</u></h3></a>
<br>
<nobr>Macro: <strong>HI</strong> [ &lt;measure&gt; ]</nobr>
<br>
<em>*The optional argument requires a <a href="definitions.html#TERMS_UNITOFMEASURE">unit of measure</a></em>

<p>
A hanging indent looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
	The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as best I
	    could, but when he ventured upon insult, I vowed
	    revenge.  You who so well know the nature of my soul
	    will not suppose, however, that I gave utterance to a
	    threat, at length I would be avenged...
</pre>

The first line of text &quot;hangs&quot; outside the left
margin.
<p>
In order to use hanging indents, you must first have a left indent
active (set with either
<a href="#IL">IL</a>
or
<a href="#IB">IB</a>).
<strong>Mom</strong> will not hang text outside the left margin set with
<a href="#L_MARGIN">L_MARGIN</a>
or outside the left margin of a tab.
<p>
The first time you invoke <strong>HI</strong>, you must give it
a measure.  If you want the first line of a paragraph to hang by,
say, 1 pica, do
<p>
<pre>
	.IL 1P
	.HI 1P
</pre>

Subsequent invocations of <strong>HI</strong> do not require you
to supply a measure; <strong>mom</strong> keeps track of the
last measure you gave it.
<p>
Generally speaking, you should invoke <strong>HI</strong> immediately
prior to the line you want hung (i.e. without any intervening
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_CONTROLLINES">control lines</a>).
And because hanging indents affect only one line, there's no need to turn
them off.
<p>
<a name="NUM_LISTS"><h3><u>A recipe for numbered lists</u></h3></a>
<p>
<strong>PLEASE NOTE: mom</strong> now has macros for setting lists (see
<a href="docelement.html#LIST_INTRO">Nested lists</a>),
making this recipe superfluous.  It remains here in the hope that
it will clarify the use of hanging indents generally, if no longer
specifically.
<p>
Consider the following example:
<p>
<pre>
	.PAGE 8.5i 11i 1i 1i 1i 1i
	.FAMILY  T
	.FT      R
	.PT_SIZE 12
	.LS      14
	.JUSTIFY
	.KERN
	.SS 0
	.IL \w'\0\0.'    \"Indent left by 2 figure spaces and a period
	.HI \w'\0\0.'    \"Hang first line of text back by 2 figure spaces and a period
	1.\0The most important point to be considered is whether the
	answer to the meaning of life, the universe, and everything
	really is 42.  We have no-one's word on the subject except
	Mr. Adams'.
	.HI
	2.\0If the answer to the meaning of life, the universe,
	and everything is indeed 42, what impact does this have on
	the politics of representation?  42 is, after all not a
	prime number.  Are we to infer that prime numbers don't
	deserve equal rights and equal access in the universe?
	.HI
	3.\0If 42 is deemed non-exclusionary, how do we present it
	as the answer and, at the same time, forestall debate on its
	exclusionary implications?
</pre>

First, we invoke a left indent with a measure equal to the width
of 2
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_FIGURESPACE">figures spaces</a>
plus a period (using the
<a href="inlines.html#INLINE_STRINGWIDTH_GROFF">\w</a>
inline escape).  At this point, the left indent is active; text
afterwards would normally be indented.  However, we invoke a hanging
indent of exactly the same width, which hangs the first line (and
first line only!) to the left of the indent by the same distance
(in this case, that means &quot;out to the left margin&quot;).
Because we begin the first line with a number, a period, and a
figure space, the actual text (&quot;The most important point...&quot;)
starts at exactly the same spot as the indented lines that
follow.
<p>
Notice that subsequent invocations of <strong>HI</strong> without a
measure produce exactly the same effect.
<p>
Paste the example above into a file and preview it with <kbd>groff -mom -X
&lt;filename&gt;</kbd> to see hanging indents in action.
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Unlike <strong>IL, IR</strong> and
<strong>IB</strong>, measures given to <strong>HI</strong>
are NOT additive.  Each time you pass a measure to
<strong>HI</strong>, the measure is treated literally.
<p>

<!---IX--->

<hr width="66%" align="left">
<a name="IQ"><h3><u>Quitting indents</u></h3></a>

<nobr>Macro: <strong>IQ</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;[ CLEAR ]&nbsp;&nbsp;(quit any/all indents -- see <strong>*IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>)</nobr>

<nobr>Macro: <strong>ILX</strong>&nbsp;[ CLEAR ]&nbsp;&nbsp;(exit <strong>I</strong>ndent <strong>L</strong>eft)</nobr>

<br>
<nobr>Macro: <strong>IBX</strong>&nbsp;[ CLEAR ]&nbsp;&nbsp;(exit <strong>I</strong>ndent <strong>B</strong>oth)</nobr>

<p>
<strong>*IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Formerly, the macro for quitting all indents was</em>
<strong>.IX</strong><em>.  This usage is now deprecated, in favour
of</em> <strong>.IQ</strong><em>.</em> <strong>.IX</strong> <em>will
continue to behave as before, but</em> <strong>mom</strong> <em>will
issue a warning to stderr indicating that you should update your
documents.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a consequence of this change,</em>
<strong>ILX, IRX</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>IBX</strong> <em>may
now also be invoked as</em> <strong>ILQ, IRQ</strong> <em>and</em>
<strong>IBQ</strong><em>.  Both forms are acceptable.</em>
<p>
Without an argument, the macros to quit indents merely restore your
original margins and line length.  The measures stored in the
indent macros themselves are saved so you can call them again without
having to supply a measure.
<p>
If you pass these macros the optional argument <strong>CLEAR</strong>,
they not only restore your original left margin and line length,
but also clear any values associated with a  particular indent style.
The next time you need an indent of the same style, you have to supply
a measure again.
<p>
<strong>IQ CLEAR</strong>, as you'd suspect, quits and clears
the values for all indent styles at once.
