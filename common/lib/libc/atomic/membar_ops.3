.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm membar_ops
family of functions provide memory access barrier operations necessary
for synchronization in multiprocessor execution environments that have
relaxed load and store order.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "membar_producer()"
.It Fn membar_enter
All loads and stores preceding the memory barrier will complete and
reach global visibility before any stores after the memory barrier reach
global visibility
.Pq RW-W .
.Fn membar_enter
is typically used in code that implements locking primitives to ensure
that a lock protects its data.
.It Fn membar_exit
All stores preceding the memory barrier will reach global visibility
before any loads and stores after the memory barrier will complete and
reach global visibility
.Pq W-RW .
.Fn membar_exit
is typically used in code that implements locking primitives when a lock
is released.
.It Fn membar_producer
All stores preceding the memory barrier will reach global visibility
before any stores after the memory barrier reach global visibility
.Pq W-W .
.It Fn membar_consumer
All loads preceding the memory barrier will complete before any loads
after the memory barrier complete
.Pq R-R .
.It Fn membar_sync
All loads and stores preceding the memory barrier will complete and
reach global visibility before any loads and stores after the memory
barrier complete and reach global visibility
.Pq RW-RW .
