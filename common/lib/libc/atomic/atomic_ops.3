.Sh NAME
.Nm atomic_ops
.Nd atomic memory operations
.\" .Sh LIBRARY
.\" .Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/atomic.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm atomic_ops
family of functions provide atomic memory operations.
There are 7 classes of atomic memory operations available:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "atomic_swap(3)"
.It Xr atomic_add 3
These functions perform atomic addition.
.It Xr atomic_and 3
These functions perform atomic logical
.Sq and .
.It Xr atomic_cas 3
These functions perform atomic compare-and-swap.
.It Xr atomic_dec 3
These functions perform atomic decrement.
.It Xr atomic_inc 3
These functions perform atomic increment.
.It Xr atomic_or 3
These functions perform atomic logical
.Sq or .
.It Xr atomic_swap 3
These functions perform atomic swap.
.El
.Pp
After an atomic operation is complete, the store to the target memory
location will have global visibility.
The global visibility of other loads and stores before and after the atomic
operation are undefined.
Applications that require synchronization of loads and stores with respect
to an atomic operation must use memory barriers.
See
.Xr membar_ops 3 .
.Pp
Because atomic memory operations require expensive synchronization at the
hardware level, applications should take care to minimize their use.
In certain cases, it may be more appropriate to use a mutex, especially
if more than one memory location will be modified.
.Pp
Users of atomic memory operations should not make assumptions about how
the memory access is performed
.Pq specifically, the width of the memory access .
For this reason, applications making use of atomic memory operations should
limit their use to regular memory.
The results of using atomic memory operations on anything other than
regular memory are undefined.
