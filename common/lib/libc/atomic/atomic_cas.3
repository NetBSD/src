.Ft uint32_t
.Fn atomic_cas_32 "volatile uint32_t *ptr" "uint32_t old" "uint32_t new"
.Ft unsigned int
.Fn atomic_cas_uint "volatile unsigned int *ptr" "unsigned int old" \

.Ft uint64_t
.Fn atomic_cas_64 "volatile uint64_t *ptr" "uint64_t old" "uint64_t new"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm atomic_cas
family of functions perform a compare-and-swap operation in an atomic fashion.
The value of the variable referenced by
.Fa ptr
is compared against
.Fa old .
If the values are equal,
.Fa new
is stored in the variable referenced by
.Fa ptr .
.Pp
The old value of the variable referenced by
.Fa ptr
is always returned regardless of whether or not the new value was stored.
Applications can test for success of the operation by comparing the
return value to the value passed as
.Fa old ;
if they are equal then the new value was stored.
.Pp
The 64-bit variants of these functions are available only on platforms
that can support atomic 64-bit memory access.
Applications can check for the availability of 64-bit atomic memory
operations by testing if the pre-processor macro
.Dv __HAVE_ATOMIC64_OPS
is defined.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm atomic_cas
functions first appeared in
.Nx 5.0 .
