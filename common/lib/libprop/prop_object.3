.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn prop_object
family of functions operate on all property container object types.
.Bl -tag -width ""
.It Fn prop_object_retain "prop_object_t obj"
Increment the reference count on an object.
.It Fn prop_object_release "prop_object_t obj"
Decrement the reference count on an object.
If the last reference is dropped, the object is freed.
.It Fn prop_object_type "prop_object_t obj"
Determine the type of the object.
Objects are one of the following types:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "PROP_TYPE_DICT_KEYSYM" -compact
.It Dv PROP_TYPE_BOOL
Boolean value
.Pq prop_bool_t
.It Dv PROP_TYPE_NUMBER
Number
.Pq prop_number_t
.It Dv PROP_TYPE_STRING
String
.Pq prop_string_t
.It Dv PROP_TYPE_DATA
Opaque data
.Pq prop_data_t
.It Dv PROP_TYPE_ARRAY
Array
.Pq prop_array_t
.It Dv PROP_TYPE_DICTIONARY
Dictionary
.Pq prop_dictionary_t
.It Dv PROP_TYPE_DICT_KEYSYM
Dictionary key symbol
.Pq prop_dictionary_keysym_t
.El
.Pp
If
.Fa obj
is
.Dv NULL ,
then
.Dv PROP_TYPE_UNKNOWN
is returned.
.It Fn prop_object_equals "prop_object_t obj1" "prop_object_t obj2"
Returns
.Dv true
if the two objects are of the same type and are equivalent.
.It Fn prop_object_iterator_next "prop_object_iterator_t iter"
Return the next object in the collection
.Pq array or dictionary
being iterated by the iterator
.Fa iter .
If there are no more objects in the collection,
.Dv NULL
is returned.
.It Fn prop_object_iterator_reset "prop_object_iterator_t iter"
Reset the iterator to the first object in the collection being iterated
by the iterator
.Fa iter .
.It Fn prop_object_iterator_release "prop_object_iterator_t iter"
Release the iterator
.Fa iter .
