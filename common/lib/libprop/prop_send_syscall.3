.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm prop_array_send_syscall ,
.Nm prop_array_recv_syscall ,
.Nm prop_dictionary_send_syscall ,
.Nm prop_dictionary_recv_syscall
.Nd send and receive property lists to and from the kernel using syscalls
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In prop/proplib.h
.Ft int
.Fn prop_array_send_syscall "prop_array_t array" "struct plistref *prefp"
.Ft int
.Fn prop_array_recv_syscall "const struct plistref *prefp" \
    "prop_array_t *arrayp"
.Ft int
.Fn prop_dictionary_send_syscall "prop_dictionary_t dict" \
    "struct plistref *prefp"
.Ft int
.Fn prop_dictionary_recv_syscall "const struct plistref *prefp" \
    "prop_dictionary_t *dictp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn prop_array_send_syscall ,
.Fn prop_array_recv_syscall ,
.Fn prop_dictionary_send_syscall ,
and
.Fn prop_dictionary_recv_syscall
functions implement the user space side of a protocol for sending property
lists to and from the kernel using
.Xr syscall 2 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, functions return zero.
Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following
.Pq simplified
example demonstrates using
.Fn prop_dictionary_send_syscall
and
.Fn prop_dictionary_recv_syscall
in an application:
.Bd -literal
void
foo_setprops(prop_dictionary_t dict)
{
    struct pref pref;

    (void) prop_dictionary_send_syscall(dict, \*[Am]pref);
    (void) my_syscall_set(\*[Am]pref);

}

prop_dictionary_t
foo_getprops(void)
{
    prop_dictionary_t dict;
    struct pref pref;

    (void) my_syscall_get(\*[Am]pref);
    if (prop_dictionary_recv_syscall(\*[Am]pref, \*[Am]dict) != 0)
        return (NULL);

    return (dict);
}
