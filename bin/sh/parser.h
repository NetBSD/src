/*
 * The parser references the elements of struct parse_state quite
 * frequently - they used to be simple globals, so one memory ref
 * per access, adding an indirect through global ptr would not be
 * nice.   The following gross hack allows most of that cost to be
 * avoided, by allowing the compiler to understand that the global
 * pointer is in fact constant in any function, and so its value can
 * be cached, rather than needing to be fetched every time in case
 * some other called function has changed it.
 *
 * The rule to make this work is that any function that wants
 * to alter the global must restore it before it returns (and thus
 * must have an error trap handler).  That means that the struct
 * used for the new parser state can be a local in that function's
 * stack frame, it never needs to be malloc'd.
