.Sh NAME
.Nm makewhatis
.Nd create a whatis.db database
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm /usr/libexec/makewhatis
.Op Fl C Ar file
.Op Fl f
.Op Ar manpath ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
strips the NAME lines from compiled or raw
.Xr man 1
pages and creates
a whatis.db database
for use in
.Xr apropos 1 ,
.Xr whatis 1
or with
.Xr man 1 Ns 's
.Fl k
option.
Man pages compressed with
.Xr compress 1
and
.Xr gzip 1
are uncompressed before processing.
.Pp
When
.Ar manpath
is provided multiple times, the resulting database file
is generated in the first directory specified, and contains
entries for all the directories.
.Pp
If
.Ar manpath
is not provided,
.Nm
parses
.Pa /etc/man.conf
and regenerates the whatis database files specified there.
Each database file is assumed to reside in the root of the appropriate
man page hierarchy.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl C Ar file
Use
.Ar file
(in
.Xr man.conf 5
format) as configuration file instead of the default,
.Pa /etc/man.conf .
.It Fl f
Don't spawn child processes to generate the individual database files,
but do all the work synchronously in the foreground.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -compact -width /etc/man.conf1
.It Pa whatis.db
name of the whatis database
.It Pa /etc/man.conf
.Xr man 1
configuration file, used to get the location of the whatis databases when
.Nm
is called without arguments
