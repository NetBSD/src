.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a library interface to the
.Xr bozohttpd 8
web server.
The
.Nm
library can be used to embed a webserver
in your applications.
.Pp
Normal operation sees the
.Nm
process be initialised using the
.Fn bozo_set_defaults
function, which will set up the default port
and other internal settings, allocating
any necessary space as needed.
The
.Fn bozo_set_defaults
function returns 1 on sucess, 0 on failure.
.Pp
The
.Fn bozo_setup
function is used to specify the virtual host name
for the web server.
A NULL host name will mean that
.Nm
will use the local value for the host name,
as returned by
.Xr gethostname 3 .
This virtual hostname should be a fully qualified domain name.
The final argument to
.Fn bozo_setup
is the name of the directory to serve as the root
directory of the web server tree.
.Pp
Once the server has been set up, it serves
requests by using the
.Fn bozo_read_request
function, which returns a pointer to a request structure,
and
.Fn bozo_process_request ,
which deals with the request, and answers the client.
The request space is de-allocated
using the
.Fn bozo_clean_request
function.
.Pp
Preferences are set
using the function
.Fn bozo_set_pref
function
and queried using the two
.Fn bozo_get_pref
function.
This is the main interface for selecting options, and for
setting preferences.
