.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program reads a
.Em HTTP
request from the standard input, and sends a reply to the standard output.
Besides ~user translation and virtual hosting support (see below), all file
requests are from
.Ar slashdir
directory.
The server uses
.Ar myname
as its name, which defaults to the local hostname, obtained from
.Xr gethostname 3
(but see the
.Fl v
option for virtual hosting.)
.Nm
writes logs to
.Xr syslog 3
using the ftp facility (but see the
.Fl s
option for testing.)
.Nm
is designed to be small, simple and relatively featureless,
hopefully increasing its security.
.Ss OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width xxxcgibin
.It Fl b
Enables daemon mode, where
.Nm
detaches from the current terminal, running in the background and
servicing HTTP requests.
.It Fl C Ar suffix cgihandler
Adds a new CGI handler program for a particular file type.
The
.Ar suffix
should be any normal file suffix, and the
.Ar cgihandler
should be a full path to an interpreter.
This option is the only way to enable CGI programs that exist
outside of the cgibin directory to be executed.
Multiple
.Fl C
options may be passed.
.It Fl c Ar cgibin
Enables the CGI/1.1 interface.
The
.Ar cgibin
directory is expected to contain the CGI programs to be used.
.Nm
looks for URL's in the form of
.Em /cgi-bin/\*[Lt]scriptname\*[Gt]
where
.Aq scriptname
is a valid CGI program in the
.Ar cgibin
directory.
In other words, all CGI URL's must begin with
.Em \%/cgi-bin/ .
Note that the CGI/1.1 interface is not available with
.Em ~user
translation.
.It Fl e
Causes
.Nm
to not clear the environment when used with either the
.Fl t
or
.Fl U
options.
.It Fl f
Stops the
.Fl b
flag from
.Nm
detaching from the tty and going into the background.
.It Fl H
Causes directory index mode to hide files and directories
that start with a period, except for
.Pa .. .
Also see
.Fl X .
.It Fl I Ar port
Causes
.Nm
to use
.Ar port
instead of the default
.Dq http
port.
When used with the
.Fl b
option, it changes the bound port.
Otherwise it forces redirections to use this port instead of the
value obtained via
.Xr getsockname 2 .
.It Fl i Ar address
Causes
.Ar address
to be used as the address to bind daemon mode.
If otherwise unspecified, the address used to bind is derived from the
.Ar myname ,
which defaults to the name returned by
.Xr gethostname 3 .
Only the last
.Fl i
option is used.
This option is only valid with the
.Fl b
option.
.It Fl L Ar prefix script
Adds a new Lua script for a particular prefix.
The
.Ar prefix
should be an arbitrary text, and the
.Ar script
should be a full path to a Lua script.
Multiple
.Fl L
options may be passed.
A separate Lua state is created for each prefix.
The Lua script can register callbacks using the
httpd.register_handler('<name>', function) Lua function,
which will trigger the execution of the Lua function
.Em function
when a URL in the form
.Em http://<hostname>/<prefix>/<name>
is being accessed.
The function is passed three tables as arguments, the server
environment, the request headers, and the decoded query string
plus any data that was send as application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
.It Fl M Ar suffix type encoding encoding11
Adds a new entry to the table that converts file suffixes to
content type and encoding.
This option takes four additional arguments containing
the file prefix, its
.Dq Content-Type ,
.Dq Content-Encoding ,
and
.Dq Content-Encoding
for HTTP/1.1 connections, respectively.
If any of these are a single dash
.Pq Dq - ,
the empty string is used instead.
Multiple
.Fl M
options may be passed.
.It Fl n
Stops
.Nm
from doing IP address to name resolution of hosts for setting the
.Ev REMOTE_HOST
variable before running a CGI program.
This option has no effect without the
.Fl c
option.
.It Fl P Ar pidfile
Causes
.Nm
to create a pid file in
.Ar pidfile
when run in daemon mode with the
.Fl b
option.
.It Fl p Ar pubdir
Changes the default user directory for
.Em /~user/
translations from
.Dq public_html
to
.Ar pubdir .
.It Fl r
Forces pages besides the
.Dq index.html
(see the
.Fl X
option) page to require that the Referrer: header be present and
refer to this web server, otherwise a redirect to the
.Dq index.html
page will be returned instead.
.It Fl S Ar server_software
Sets the internal server version to
.Ar server_software .
.It Fl s
Forces logging to be set to stderr always.
.It Fl t Ar chrootdir
Makes
.Nm
chroot to the specified directory
before answering requests.
Every other path should be specified relative
to the new root, if this option is used.
Note that the current environment
is normally replaced with an empty environment with this option, unless the
.Fl e
option is also used.
.It Fl U Ar username
Causes
.Nm
to switch to the user and the groups of
.Ar username
after initialization.
This option, like
.Fl t
above, causes
.Nm
to clear the environment unless the
.Fl e
option is given.
.It Fl u
Enables the transformation of Uniform Resource Locators of
the form
.Em /~user/
into the directory
.Pa ~user/public_html
(but see the
.Fl p
option above).
.It Fl V
Sets the default virtual host directory to
.Ar slashdir .
If no directory exists in
.Ar virtualroot
for the request, then
.Ar slashdir
will be used.
The default behaviour is to return 404 (Not Found.)
.It Fl v Ar virtualroot
Enables virtual hosting support.
Directories in
.Ar virtualroot
will be searched for a matching virtual host name, when parsing
the HTML request.
If a matching name is found, it will be used
as both the server's real name,
.Op Ar myname ,
and as the
.Ar slashdir .
See the
.Sx EXAMPLES
section for an example of using this option.
.It Fl X
Enables directory indexing.
A directory index will be generated only when the default file (i.e.
.Pa index.html
normally) is not present.
.It Fl x Ar index
Changes the default file read for directories from
.Dq index.html
to
.Ar index .
.It Fl Z Ar certificate_path privatekey_path
Sets the path to the server certificate file and the private key file
in pem format.
It also causes
.Nm
to start SSL mode.
.El
.Pp
Note that in
.Nm
versions 20031005 and prior that supported the
.Fl C
and
.Fl M
options, they took a single space-separated argument that was parsed.
since version 20040828, they take multiple options (2 in the case of
.Fl C
and 4 in the case of
.Fl M . )
.Ss INETD CONFIGURATION
As
.Nm
uses
.Xr inetd 8
by default to process incoming TCP connections for HTTP requests
(but see the
.Fl b
option),
.Nm
has little internal networking knowledge.
(Indeed, you can run it on the command line with little change of functionality.)
A typical
.Xr inetd.conf 5
entry would be:
.Bd -literal
http stream tcp  nowait:600 _httpd /usr/libexec/httpd httpd /var/www
http stream tcp6 nowait:600 _httpd /usr/libexec/httpd httpd /var/www
.Ed
.Pp
This would serve web pages from
.Pa /var/www
on both IPv4 and IPv6 ports.
The
.Em :600
changes the
requests per minute to 600, up from the
.Xr inetd 8
default of 40.
.Pp
Using the
.Nx
.Xr inetd 8 ,
you can provide multiple IP-address based HTTP servers by having multiple
listening ports with different configurations.
.Ss NOTES
This server supports the
.Em HTTP/0.9 ,
.Em HTTP/1.0 ,
and
.Em HTTP/1.1
standards.
Support for these protocols is very minimal and many optional features are
not supported.
.Pp
.Nm
can be compiled without
CGI support (NO_CGIBIN_SUPPORT),
user transformations (NO_USER_SUPPORT),
directory index support (NO_DIRINDEX_SUPPORT),
daemon mode support (NO_DAEMON_MODE),
dynamic MIME content (NO_DYNAMIC_CONTENT),
Lua suport (NO_LUA_SUPPORT),
and SSL support (NO_SSL_SUPPORT)
by defining the listed macros when building
.Nm .
.Ss HTTP BASIC AUTHORISATION
.Nm
has support for HTTP Basic Authorisation.
If a file named
.Pa .htpasswd
exists in the directory of the current request,
.Nm
will restrict access to documents in that directory
using the RFC 2617 HTTP
.Dq Basic
authentication scheme.
.Pp
Note:
This does not recursively protect any sub-directories.
.Pp
The
.Pa .htpasswd
file contains lines delimited with a colon containing
usernames and passwords hashed with
.Xr crypt 3 ,
for example:
.Bd -literal
heather:$1$pZWI4tH/$DzDPl63i6VvVRv2lJNV7k1
jeremy:A.xewbx2DpQ8I
.Ed
.Pp
On
.Nx ,
the
.Xr pwhash 1
utility may be used to generate hashed passwords.
.Pp
While
.Nm
distributed with
.Nx
has support for HTTP Basic Authorisation enabled by default,
in the portable distribution it is excluded.
Compile
.Nm
with
.Dq -DDO_HTPASSWD
on the compiler command line to enable this support.
It may require linking with the crypt library, using
.Dq -lcrypt .
.Ss SSL SUPPORT
.Nm
has support for SSLv2, SSLv3, and TLSv1 protocols that is included by
default.
It requires linking with the crypto and ssl library, using
.Dq -lcrypto -lssl .
To disable SSL SUPPORT compile
.Nm
with
.Dq -DNO_SSL_SUPPORT
on the compiler command line.
.Ss COMPRESSION
.Nm
supports a very basic form compression.
.Nm
will serve the requested file postpended with
.Dq Pa .gz
if it exists, it is readable, the client requested gzip compression, and
the client did not make a ranged request.
.Sh FILES
.Nm
looks for a couple of special files in directories that allow certain features
to be provided on a per-directory basis.
In addition to the
.Pa .htpasswd
used by HTTP basic authorisation,
if a
.Pa .bzdirect
file is found (contents are irrelevant)
.Nm
will allow direct access even with the
.Fl r
option.
If a
.Pa .bzredirect
symbolic link is found,
.Nm
will perform a smart redirect to the target of this symlink.
The target is assumed to live on the same server.
If a
.Pa .bzabsredirect
symbolic link is found,
.Nm
will redirect to the absolute url pointed to by this symlink.
This is useful to redirect to different servers.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To configure set of virtual hosts, one would use an
.Xr inetd.conf 5
entry like:
.Bd -literal
http stream tcp  nowait:600 _httpd /usr/libexec/httpd httpd -v /var/vroot /var/www
.Ed
.Pp
and inside
.Pa /var/vroot
create a directory (or a symlink to a directory) with the same name as
the virtual host, for each virtual host.
Lookups for these names are done in a case-insensitive manner, and may
include the port number part of the request, allowing for distinct
virtual hosts on the same name.
.Pp
To use
.Nm
with PHP, one must use the
.Fl C
option to specify a CGI handler for a particular file type.
Typically this will be like:
.Bd -literal
httpd -C .php /usr/pkg/bin/php /var/www
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr inetd.conf 5 ,
.Xr inetd 8
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
was first written in perl, based on another perl http server
called
.Dq tinyhttpd .
It was then rewritten from scratch in perl, and then once again in C.
From
.Dq bozohttpd
version 20060517, it has been integrated into
.Nx .
The focus has always been simplicity and security, with minimal features
and regular code audits.
This manual documents
.Nm
version 20150501.
