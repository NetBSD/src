.Pp
Individual mail messages in the mailbox are delimited by an empty
line followed by a line beginning with the string ``From ''.
A line containing the string ``From '', the sender's name and a time stamp
is prepended to each delivered mail message.
A blank line is appended to each message.
A greater-than character (``>'') is prepended to any line in the message
which could be mistaken for a ``From '' delimiter line.

If the
.Op Fl l
flag is specified mailbox locking is done with
.Nm username.lock
files.
Otherwise, the mailbox is exclusively locked with
.Xr flock 2
while mail is appended.
