 * Early ELF support in NetBSD up to April 2nd, 2000 exposed dlopen and
 * friends via function pointers in the main object that is passed to the
 * startup code in crt0.o. Later versions kept the magic and version number
 * checks, but depend on normal symbol interposition to get the symbols from
 * rtld. The compatibility object build here contains just enough fields to
 * make either routine happy without polluting the rest of rtld.
