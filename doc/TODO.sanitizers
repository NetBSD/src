Sanitizer and related tasks.

Short term:
 - compiler-rt import and integration with base
 - merge TSan, MSan and libFuzzer ATF tests
 - prepare MKSANITIZER readme
 - kernel-asan port
 - kernel-ubsan port
 - switch syscall(2)/__syscall(2) to libc calls
 - upstream local patches, mostly to compiler-rt
 - develop fts(3) interceptors (MSan, for ls(1), find(1), mtree(8)
 - investigate and address the libcxx failing tests on NetBSD
 - no-ASLR boot.cfg option, required for MKSANITIZER

Long term:
 - FILE and DIR sanitization (needed by at least: ESan, MSan)
 - add missing interceptors (mostly MSan-centric)
 - improve the framework for ioctl(2) database and handle special cases when a
   part of a struct can be uninitialized and passed to the kernel (MSan)
 - port or finish the port of:
   * ESan,
   * LSan,
   * XRay,
   * shadowcallstack,
   * cfi,
   * scudo,
   * profile,
   * DFSan.
 - finish the research of a new syscall for StopTheWorld() operation
   ptrace(2) style for self-introspection and debugging (LSan)
 - port HWASan -- aarch64 specific, needs hardware or emulator
 - make MKSANITIZER usable with any supported by a compiler combination of
   sanitizers
 - detect and fix more bugs in basesystem
 - pkgsrc integration with sanitizers and MKSANITIZER (PKGSANITIZER?)
 - port what possible to !amd64
 - fixes with the signal code
 - attach a NetBSD buildbot testing build of compiler-rt and executing tests
 - make compiler-rt buildable with GCC
 - finish the support of float128 for Clang/LLVM/libstdc++/libgcc
 - lld port to NetBSD (GNU ld(1) is too slow for serious LLVM development)
 - merge of the libFuzzer integration with the basesystem
 - oom-killer ATF tests and fixes
 - uvm_map.c E2BIG workaround or limit raise (1MB -> 10MB?), needed by libFuzzer

Unspecified:
 - kernel-tsan? upstream development is stalled with patches for Linux 4.2
   https://github.com/google/ktsan
 - kernek-msan? in development for Linux
   https://github.com/google/kmsan
 - kernel-safestack? implemented in Fuchsia/Magenta
 - kernel coverage (KCOV?)
 - syzkaller port
