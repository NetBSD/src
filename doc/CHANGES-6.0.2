	Fix a security issue: when we are reseeding a PRNG seeded early in
	boot before we had ever had any entropy, if something else has
	consumed the entropy that triggered the immediate reseed, we can
	reseed with as little as sizeof(int) bytes of entropy.

	been treated as a time in UTC or some other time zone.
	[apb, ticket #791]

sys/compat/netbsd32/netbsd32_execve.c		1.37

share/zoneinfo/africa				patch
share/zoneinfo/antarctica			patch
share/zoneinfo/asia				patch
share/zoneinfo/australasia			patch

	Merge tzdata2013a and tzdata2013b from
	ftp://ftp.iana.org/tz/releases/tzdata2013a.tar.gz and
	ftp://ftp.iana.org/tz/releases/tzdata2013b.tar.gz .
	Important changes from tzdata2012j to tzdata2013a:
	 Chile's 2013 rules, and we guess rules for 2014 and later, will be
	 the same as 2012, namely Apr Sun>=23 03:00 UTC to
	 Sep Sun>=2 04:00 UTC.
	 New Zones Asia/Khandyga, Asia/Ust-Nera, Europe/Busingen.
	 Many changes affect historical time stamps before 1940.
	Important changes from tzdata2013a to tzdata2013b:
	 Haiti uses US daylight-saving rules this year, and presumably
	 future years.
	 Paraguay will end DST on March 24 this year.
	 Morocco does not observe DST during Ramadan;
	 try to predict Ramadan in Morocco as best we can. 
	[apb, ticket #845]

sys/secmodel/extensions/secmodel_extensions.c	1.5

	Fix a crash which can happen with sysctl security.curtain=1
	set.  PR#47598.
	[martin, ticket #839]

lib/libc/arch/alpha/gen/__longjmp14.c		1.6-1.7
lib/libc/arch/alpha/gen/__setjmp14.S		1.6

	Fix longjmp/setjmp on alpha for statically linked programs
	such as those in /rescue.
	[martin, ticket #846]

sys/kern/subr_cprng.c				1.16

	Re-fix 'fix' for SA-2013-003.  Because the original fix evaluated a
	flag backwards, in low-entropy conditions there was a time interval
	in which /dev/urandom could still output bits on an unacceptably
	short key.  Output from /dev/random was *NOT* impacted.

	Eliminate the flag in question -- it's safest to always fill the
	requested key buffer with output from the entropy-pool, even if we
	let the caller know we couldn't provide bytes with the full entropy
	it requested.

	Advisory will be updated soon with a full worst-case analysis of the
	/dev/urandom output path in the presence of either variant of the
	SA-2013-003 bug.  Fortunately, because a large amount of other input
	is mixed in before users can obtain any output, it doesn't look as
	dangerous in practice as I'd feared it might be.
	[tls, ticket #859]
