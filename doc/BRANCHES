#	$NetBSD: BRANCHES,v 1.106 2006/09/23 10:09:44 yamt Exp $
#
# This file contains a list of branches that exist in the NetBSD CVS
# tree and their current state.
#
# This list is necessarily incomplete.
# 
# Within reason, developers may create branch and version tags at any
# time for any purpose.  To avoid name collisions, private tags should
# have names which begin with the developer's NetBSD login name
# followed by a - or _ character (e.g., thorpej_scsipi,
# thorpej-signal)
# 
# Any branch or version tag not listed here should be assumed to be
# private to the developer who created it.  It is inappropriate for
# anyone other than that developer to commit, move tags, or otherwise
# modify the contents of the branch.
#
# Please update this file when a new branch is ready for consumption
# by folks other than the maintainer, or when the use or status of an
# existing branch changes significantly.
#
# Format:
#   Branch:	  name of branch
#   Description:  Purpose and intention of the branch
#   Status:	  Active/Terminated/Dormant
#   Start Date:	  date first instantiated
#   End Date:	  date it was Terminated/made_Dormant, if any
#   Base Tag:	  netbsd-1-5-base, etc.
#   Maintainer:	  Somebody to blame.
#   Scope:	  Portion of the tree covered.

# There are four sections to this file:
#   Release branches
#   Individual developers' branches (Active/Dormant)
#   Individual developers' branches (Terminated), and

#
# Entries within each section should be alphabetized.

Branch:		bjh21-hydra
Description:	Simtec Hydra support and ARM SMP in general
Status:		Dormant
Start Date:	18 Oct 2002
End Date:
Base Tag:	bjh21-hydra-base
Maintainer:	Ben Harris <bjh21@NetBSD.org>
Scope:		sys/arch/arm sys/arch/acorn32
Notes:		This code was on a branch because it involves changes to
		cpuswitch.S which would otherwise make merging the
		nathanw_sa branch difficult.

Branch:		gmcgarry_ctxsw
Description:	Separate scheduler from context-switch code
Status:		Dormant
Start Date:	18 December 2002
End Date:
Base Tag:	gmcgarry_ctxsw_base
Maintainer:	Gregory McGarry <gmcgarry@NetBSD.org>
Scope:		kernel
Notes:		Removing knowledge of the schedular and its run queues
		from the machine-dependent context switch code is the
		first step in cleaning up the scheduler.  It is necessary
		for the newlock branch, making the scheduler SMP friendly,
		adding real-time scheduler extensions, and reducing the
		number of code paths for LWP and proc switching.

Branch:		gmcgarry_ucred
Description:	Integrate and encapsulate user credentials
Status:		Dormant
Start Date:	18 December 2002
End Date:

		created. Goals:

		- Remove spinlockmgr().

		can be found at
		http://www.acm.org/pubs/citations/journals/tocs/1992-10-1/p53-anderson/
		Many ideas in the implementation are based on the

		Washington CS tech report 92-08-93, which can be found
		at
		ftp://ftp.cs.washington.edu/tr/1992/08/UW-CSE-92-08-03.PS.Z

Scope:		sys/arch/i386
Notes:
		Code committed to the branch has booted to multiuser 
		on at least one system.

		Not guaranteed to compile against mainline since -current
		may have changed incompatibly with the last branch update;
		use "cvs update -D" to roll-back the rest of the tree to match.

		Please get explicit permission from the maintainer 
		before each commit, or your changes will be backed out.
		Other tags starting with sommerfeld_ are private to 
		the developer and are guaranteed to be unstable.
		Only the maintainer should move tags.

		Note that this branch uses a DIFFERENT scheme for 
		synching with the mainline.  the maintainer uses some private
		scripts for keeping them in synch; if you make commits 
		to the branch to "resynchronize" things, you'll
		probably do it wrong; instead, ask the maintainer to
		resynchronize things.

		See sys/arch/i386/TODO on the branch for a list of known
		issues with the branch.

Description:	overhaul MIPS cache support code
Status:		Terminated; merged to -current
Start Date:	Oct 23 2001
End Date:	Nov 14 2001
Base Tag:	thorpej-mips-cache-base
Scope:		syssrc
Notes:		This branch needs more debugging, testing, and more
		ports need to be converted to the new world order.

		The following processors have had cache ops
		written:

			* R2000/R3000 (cache_r3k) -- light testing,
			  needs to be beat on a lot more to make
			  sure it's working.

			* R4000/R4400 (cache_r4k) -- mhitch@NetBSD.org
			  tracked down a bug, which has been fixed.

			  Confirmed working on R4000-with-L2.

			  Confirmed working on R4400-no-L2 and
			  R4400-with-L2.

			* R4600/R5000 (cache_r5k) -- shin@NetBSD.org
			  has committed fixes to this code.

			  Confirmed working on R4600 v2 (SGI IP-22 with
			  no SysAD L2 cache).

			  Confirmed working on RM5260 (Algorithmics P-5064).

			* TX39 (cache_tx39) -- uch@NetBSD.org has
			  committed fixes to this code.  Awaiting
			  confirmation that it is working properly.

			* R5900 (cache_r5900) -- uch@NetBSD.org has
			  written this code and tested it on a
			  PlayStation 2.

		The following ports have been updated to compile (and
		use optimized-for-processor bus_dma routines).  Those
		that have been tested and work are marked with [WORKING].

			* algor		[WORKING]

			* arc		[WORKING]

			* pmax		[WORKING]

			* playstation2	[WORKING]
					Needs optimized bus_dmamap_sync().

			* hpcmips	[need verification that this is working]
					Needs optimized bus_dmamap_sync().

			* sgimips	[WORKING]
					Needs optimized bus_dmamap_sync().

			* cobalt	[need testing]

			* mipsco	[need testing]

			* newsmips	[need testing]

Branch:		wrstuden-devbsize
Description:	Modify buffer cache to deal with different devices having
		different block sizes. Also DEV_BSIZE would go away.
Status:		Terminated
Start Date:	Aug or Sept 1999
End Date:	1 Apr 2000
Base tag:	wrstuden-devbsize-base
Maintainer:	Bill Studenmund <wrstuden@NetBSD.org>
Scope:		kernel
Notes:		No longer active due to lack of time, and introduction
		of UBC. In terms of UBC, the primary cache for
		file data is the VM cache, which needs to operate
		in terms of VM pages. As no existing device has native
		pages the same size as our VM pages, there already is
		a mapping going on between the VM system and the
		underlying blocks. So it would be easier and cleaner
		to adjust that to deal w/ different block sizes.
		Also with UBC, all i/o is in terms of bytes at an offset
		with a certain length, so the exact block size isn't a big
		deal.

		Any other wrstuden-devbsize tag may (and should) go away.

			cats, hp700 (skrll@)

		known to have the same problem as trunk:
			vax (chs@, stuck while running kvm_mkdb)

		known to have a problem:
			luna68k (and, if any, other m68k ports which use TTR)
			needs to be revisited.
			-> for luna68k, although not tested,
			   Sysmap has been moved to avoid kva conflict with
			   I/O ranges.
