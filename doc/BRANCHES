#	$NetBSD: BRANCHES,v 1.344.2.1 2018/03/15 09:11:54 pgoyette Exp $
#
# This file contains a list of branches that exist in the NetBSD CVS
# tree and their current state.
#
# This list is necessarily incomplete.
# 
# Within reason, developers may create branch and version tags at any
# time for any purpose.  To avoid name collisions, private tags should
# have names which begin with the developer's NetBSD login name
# followed by a - or _ character (e.g., thorpej_scsipi,
# thorpej-signal)
# 
# Any branch or version tag not listed here should be assumed to be
# private to the developer who created it.  It is inappropriate for
# anyone other than that developer to commit, move tags, or otherwise
# modify the contents of the branch.
#
# Please update this file when a new branch is ready for consumption
# by folks other than the maintainer, or when the use or status of an
# existing branch changes significantly.
#
# Format:
#   Branch:	  name of branch
#   Description:  Purpose and intention of the branch
#   Status:	  Active/Terminated/Dormant
#   Start Date:	  date first instantiated
#   End Date:	  date it was Terminated/made_Dormant, if any
#   Base Tag:	  netbsd-1-5-base, etc.
#   Maintainer:	  Somebody to blame.

Branch:		ad-audiomp
Description:	Add MP locking to the audio drivers
Status:		Terminated
Start Date:	28 February 2007
End Date:	7 December 2008
Base Tag:	ad-audiomp-base
Maintainer:	Andrew Doran <ad@NetBSD.org>
Scope:		kernel
Notes:		Making the audio drivers MP safe is necessary before efforts
		can be made to make the VM system MP safe. About 1/2 of the
		drivers are converted, the remaining 1/2 need more changes.

		As of import this is snapshot of work in progress and so
		may not compile; in particular the midi changes are very
		much "in progress". The audio component has been tested
		and verified to work with emuxki and auvia. There may
		be a locking issue in the ac97 code at boot.

		The are two locks per device instance, an ISR lock and
		a character device lock. The ISR lock replaces calls to
		splaudio()/splx(), and will be held across calls to device
		methods which were called at splaudio() before (e.g.
		trigger_output). The character device lock is held across
		calls to nearly all of the methods, excluding some only
		used for initialization, e.g. get_locks. This needs to be
		documented at merge time.

		To test on a multi way x86 system, search for "mpsafe" in
		x86/x86/intr.c and change IPL_SCHED to IPL_AUDIO. Run a job
		that will acquire the ISR lock (depends on the hardware, but
		"while true; do mixerctl -a > /dev/null; done" may suffice).
		Play audio, run lockstat and verify that that there is
		contention on the ISR lock.

		- Switch UDP sockets to a separate lock, test and benchmark.

Branch:		rpaulo-netinet-merge-pcb
Description:	merge in6pcb with inpcb
Status:		Dormant
Start Date:	Wed Feb 01 2006
End Date:	
Base Tag:	rpaulo-netinet-merge-pcb-base
Maintainer:	Rui Paulo <rpaulo@NetBSD.org>
Scope:		src/sys
Notes:		No longer active due to the lack of time. If you plan to
		continue this branch, sys/netinet/in_pcb.h already contains
		the proposed structure layout (which was roughly discussed
		in the tech-net mailing list).
		I also defined INP_*() macros to mimicate FreeBSD's inpcb
		locking style, but currently they do nothing and are not
		yet called at the correct places (needs discussion about
		kernel fine-grained locking).
		To continue this branch, one needs to read all the relevant
		inpcb/in6pcb source files and change the function names,
		structure names, structure fields according to the new
		layout (in6pcb is gone).
		Don't try to build a kernel from this branch because it won't
		work. The missing pieces required to do a complete build
		were not committed because they were incomplete and generated
		panics.
		You shouldn't need to worry about KAME syncs because
		they did most of them by now.
		After the work is done, you are required to test the branch
		(before the merge to -current) with an interop IPv6 test.

Branch:  	wrstuden-fixsa

Status: 	Active
Start Date:	15 May 2007
End Date:
Base Tag:	wrstuden-fixsa-base
Maintainer:	Bill Stouder-Studenmund <wrstuden@NetBSD.org>
Scope:		src, though all the interesting stuff is in the kernel
		or lib/libpthread or maybe gdb.
Notes:		This branch is based off of the netbsd-4 branch!
		This branch is intended to stage improvements for the
		Scheduler Activations system for NetBSD 4. Improvements
		include not allocating memory while preparing to tsleep(),
		reducing inappropriate upcall delivery (hopefully also
		eliminating the need to mlock stacks), and being
		able to pthread_kill() running threads. At this date,
		most goals have been achieved. This branch also includes
		fixes to gdb to support working with threaded apps.

End Date:
Base Tag:	wrstuden-revivesa-base
Maintainer:	Bill Stouder-Studenmund <wrstuden@NetBSD.org>
Scope:		src, though all the interesting stuff is in the kernel
Notes:		This branch is intended to revive Scheduler Activations
		in -current in the 5.0 era. This branch's main goal is
		to re-add syscall compatability so that SA-based libpthread
		programs can run with a -current kernel. 1:1 threading will
		remain the NetBSD-default. This branch will re-add necessary
		upcall support, and will also serve as a chance to clean
		out cruft that had accumulated in the implementation over
		time.

Base Tag:	yamt-pagecache-base8
Maintainer:	YAMAMOTO Takashi <yamt@NetBSD.org>
Scope:		src
Notes:		- maintain object pages in radix tree rather than rb tree.
		- shrink the size of vm_page.
		- reduce unnecessary page scan in putpages.  esp. when an
		  object has a ton of pages cached but only a few of them
		  are dirty.
		- reduce the number of pmap operations by tracking page
		  dirtiness more precisely in uvm layer.
		- fix nfs commit range tracking.
		- fix nfs write clustering.  XXX hack
		- fix A->O loaning
		- write radixtree(9) man page

		TODO:
			- benchmark
			- test
			- make the write clustering fix less kludgy
			- fix or disable the ad-hoc per-cpu statistic
			- disable A->O loan as its benefit is unclear at best

		tested: i386, amd64, nfs, ffs

		have good chances to be broken: lfs, sparc64, hp700

		the following is kernel build test results.
		most of NG seem unrelated to the changes in the branch.

Branch:		reinoud-bufcleanup
Description:	implement and evaluate struct buf usage cleanup strategies.
		Ideas currently in mind (preference for b):
		a)
			1. use of bio_ops per buffer.
			2. allow chaining/overloading of functions in bio_ops
			   and provide some private context.
			3. extend the bio_ops with commonly used functionality
			   like pending action counting, custom context passing,
			   last minute processing of buffer data, buffer cache
			   etc.
			4. investigate the use of the kcont()
			   continuation-passing framework for async io
			   completion notification for bufs
			...
		b)
			1. all sequencing use of B_CALL replaced by
			   device-threads, if possible generic code around BUFQ
			2. possibly use kcont() for async IO finished signaling
			3. counter of pending and queued actions requestable
			   by IOCTL interface?
			4. implement `last minute buffer fixup' calls and maybe
			   even finished I/O calls as vnode operations
			...

Base Tag:	rmind-uvmplock-base
Maintainer:	Mindaugas Rasiukevicius <rmind@netbsd.org>
Scope:		Kernel
Notes:		Goals:

		- Reorganize locking in UVM and serialize pmap(9) operations
		  on same page(s).  New lock order: [vmpage-lock] -> pmap-lock.
		  Based on the patch from ad@.
		- Simplify locking in pmap(9) modules by removing P->V locking.
		- Use mutex_obj(9) on vmobjlock (and thus vnode_t::v_interlock)
		  to share locks among UVM objects where necessary.
		- Rewrite and optimize x86 TLB shootdown code.
		- Unify /dev/mem et al in MI code and provide required locking.

		Future work:

		- Optimize pmap_remove() with tracking in struct vm_map_entry.

Maintainer:	Bill Sommerfeld <sommerfeld@NetBSD.org>
Scope:		sys/arch/i386
Notes:
		Code committed to the branch has booted to multiuser 
		on at least one system.

		Not guaranteed to compile against mainline since -current
		may have changed incompatibly with the last branch update;
		use "cvs update -D" to roll-back the rest of the tree to match.

		Please get explicit permission from the maintainer 
		before each commit, or your changes will be backed out.
		Other tags starting with sommerfeld_ are private to 
		the developer and are guaranteed to be unstable.
		Only the maintainer should move tags.

		Note that this branch uses a DIFFERENT scheme for 
		syncing with the mainline.  the maintainer uses some private
		scripts for keeping them in sync; if you make commits 
		to the branch to "resynchronize" things, you'll
		probably do it wrong; instead, ask the maintainer to
		resynchronize things.

		See sys/arch/i386/TODO on the branch for a list of known
		issues with the branch.

Scope:		syssrc
Notes:		This branch needs more debugging, testing, and more
		ports need to be converted to the new world order.

		The following processors have had cache ops
		written:

			* R2000/R3000 (cache_r3k) -- light testing,
			  needs to be beat on a lot more to make
			  sure it's working.

			* R4000/R4400 (cache_r4k) -- mhitch@NetBSD.org
			  tracked down a bug, which has been fixed.

			  Confirmed working on R4000-with-L2.

			  Confirmed working on R4400-no-L2 and
			  R4400-with-L2.

			* R4600/R5000 (cache_r5k) -- shin@NetBSD.org
			  has committed fixes to this code.

			  Confirmed working on R4600 v2 (SGI IP-22 with
			  no SysAD L2 cache).

			  Confirmed working on RM5260 (Algorithmics P-5064).

			* TX39 (cache_tx39) -- uch@NetBSD.org has
			  committed fixes to this code.  Awaiting
			  confirmation that it is working properly.

			* R5900 (cache_r5900) -- uch@NetBSD.org has
			  written this code and tested it on a
			  PlayStation 2.

		The following ports have been updated to compile (and
		use optimized-for-processor bus_dma routines).  Those
		that have been tested and work are marked with [WORKING].

			* algor		[WORKING]

			* arc		[WORKING]

			* pmax		[WORKING]

			* playstation2	[WORKING]

Notes:		Still has a number of issues:
		 - Some heavy workload performance issues on SMP machines.
		   Work around this issue by turning on WAPBL_DEBUG_SERIALIZE
		   in rev 1.1.2.11 of vfs_wapbl.c.
		 - Removing large files (sparse only?) takes a long time.
		   Eg, a file created with
		      dd if=/dev/zero of=foox bs=1 count=1 seek=11261748520550
		   takes 0:00.00 to remove on my test box without logging and
		   0:22.25 to remove with logging.  No disk IO during this...
		 - sysinst should use in-fs logs now, not end-of-partition logs.

Branch:		wrstuden-devbsize
Description:	Modify buffer cache to deal with different devices having
		different block sizes. Also DEV_BSIZE would go away.
Status:		Terminated
Start Date:	Aug or Sept 1999
End Date:	1 Apr 2000
Base tag:	wrstuden-devbsize-base
Maintainer:	Bill Studenmund <wrstuden@NetBSD.org>
Scope:		kernel
Notes:		No longer active due to lack of time, and introduction
		of UBC. In terms of UBC, the primary cache for
		file data is the VM cache, which needs to operate
		in terms of VM pages. As no existing device has native
		pages the same size as our VM pages, there already is
		a mapping going on between the VM system and the
		underlying blocks. So it would be easier and cleaner
		to adjust that to deal w/ different block sizes.
		Also with UBC, all i/o is in terms of bytes at an offset
		with a certain length, so the exact block size isn't a big
		deal.

		Any other wrstuden-devbsize tag may (and should) go away.

		How to adapt a port?

		- unify cpu_switch, cpu_exit, cpu_switchto into
		  a single cpu_switchto.  see cpu_switchto.9.

		- implement cpu_idle.  see cpu_idle.9.

		- add a flag argument to cpu_need_resched.
		  handle RESCHED_IMMED flag, which means "cause a preemption
		  as soon as possible."  eg. in the case of MULTIPROCESSOR,
		  send an IPI to the target cpu.

		- "curlwp == NULL" is not a valid check for idle state anymore.
		  use "(curlwp->l_flag & LW_IDLE) != 0" instead.  curlwp is
		  almost always non-NULL, with exceptions like early on boot.

		- remove idle pcbs.

		- (if MULTIPROCESSOR) tweak processor trampoline code.

		- (if MULTIPROCESSOR) call mi_cpu_attach when attaching
		  secondary processors.

		- (if schedhz!=0) call schedclock regardless of the value of
		  curlwp.

		- of course, update MD users of scheduler/switching API.

Branch:		thorpej-atomic
Description:	Implementation of an atomic memory operations API modeled
		after the one in Solaris 10.
Status:		Terminated; merged to -current
Start Date:	Apr 11 2007
End Date:	Nov 18 2007
Base tag:	thorpej-atomic-base
Maintainer:	Jason Thorpe <thorpej@netbsd.org>
Scope:		src/common
		src/sys
Notes:		Base atomic primitives need to be implemented for
		all of the supported architectures:

		alpha		DONE
		arm		DONE
		hppa
		i386		DONE
		ia64
		m68k		DONE (except for 68010)
		mips
		ns32k
		powerpc		DONE except for membar_*()
		powerpc64	DONE except for membar_*()
		sh3
		sparc		DONE except for membar_*()
		sparc64		DONE except for membar_*()
		vax
		x86_64		DONE

		Tested:

		alpha		NO
		arm		NO
		hppa		NO
		i386		NO
		ia64		NO
		m68k		NO
		mips		NO
		ns32k		NO
		powerpc		NO
		powerpc64	NO
		sh3		NO
		sparc		NO
		sparc64		NO
		vax		NO
		x86_64		NO

		TODO:

		all		- Need to replace mb_*() with membar_*().

				- Audit MUTEX_CAS() and RWLOCK_CAS() uses
				  to see of membar_enter() is required here.

				- Talk to ad@ -- figure out of non-atomic
				  mutex / rwlock release is actually safe.

		arm		- Consider using a RAS technique like
				  MIPS uses for _lock_cas() and the mutex
				  stubs.  Possibly do more than one atomic
				  op as a RAS.  Possibly implement mutex
				  stubs using the technique.

		m68k		- Need to do 68010 support.
		
		i386		- Need to change when x86_patch() is called
				  so we can test ncpus.

		powerpc		- Figure out if we need barriers in the
				  atomic ops themselves (hopefully not!)

		x86_64		- Need to change when x86_patch() is called
				  so we can test ncpus.
