	[jmmv, ticket #31]

usr.bin/gzip/gzip.c				1.33-1.34

	[jmc, ticket #35]

sys/netinet/ip_fil_netbsd.c			1.4

	Untangle ioctl copyin/copyout confusion. IP-Filter now actually works
	on sparc64 (and probably everywhere else).
	[martin, ticket #39]

dist/ipf/tools/ipf_y.y				1.2

	ioctl(2) "request" arguments should be ioctlcmd_t, not u_int.
	[martin, ticket #40]

sys/kern/kern_ras.c				1.8-1.9

	ras_install: don't do pool_get(PR_WAITOK) while we're holding a
	             spinlock.
	ras_fork:    don't do PR_WAITOK holding a spinlock.
	[yamt, ticket #41]

usr.sbin/ipf/ipf/Makefile			1.20
usr.sbin/ipf/ipftest/Makefile			1.27

usr.sbin/ipf/ipnat/Makefile			1.22
usr.sbin/ipf/ippool/Makefile			1.6
usr.sbin/ipf/ipsend/Makefile			1.23

	Simplify `bar.c: bar.y' (et al) rules by moving header dependencies
	which bar.o (not bar.c) needs to DPSRCS, and using {.ALLSRC} in the
	target now that only bar.y is a source.
	[lukem, ticket #42]

sys/dev/pci/pcidevs				1.616
sys/dev/pci/pcidevs.h				regen
sys/dev/pci/pcidevs_data.h			regen

	Correct entry for PCI vendor id 0x11af. It is assigned to Avid 
	Technology Inc. and not to Pro-Log Corporation. PR#25004
	[tron, ticket #38]

sys/kern/kern_sig.c				1.190

	If a signal is the result of trap, only invoke a supplied handler
	if it's not blocked.  Otherwise (it if it blocked or the handler
	is set to SIG_IGN) reset the signal back to its default settings
	so that a coredump can be generated.
	[matt, ticket #43]

sys/arch/macppc/macppc/machdep.c		1.131
sys/arch/powerpc/oea/oea_machdep.c		1.16

	Move to softintr__init to cpu_startup and remove softintr__init call 
	for oea.
	[matt, ticket #44]

sys/dev/ic/i82557.c				1.82

	Be more careful about issuing CU_RESUME in fxp_start()--only doing
	it if we think it's probably necessary.  Then do it again in the
	tx interrupt handler, if we again think it's necessary.  This
	reduces the number of commands we issue the chip.  Prior to this
	change, the i82550 (running without extended feature set, so like
	a '559)  would sometimes fail in fxp_scb_wait() prior to issuing
	another CU_RESUME, resulting in
	        fxp0: WARNING: SCB timed out!
	messages on the console, often followed by device timeouts.
	[briggs, ticket #45]

sys/netinet/fil.c				1.62
sys/netinet/ip_lookup.c				1.2

	A few more ioctl vs. copyin changes, spotted by Bill Studenmund.

sys/arch/i386/stand/misc/rawrite.txt		delete

	Convert to using UUDECODE_FILES instead of using -kb in the repository.
	[lukem, ticket #47]

sys/dev/mvme/vme_two.c				1.4

	After re-checking the docs in response to a port-mvme68k question,
	don't claim to support D8 local-bus->VMEbus transfers.
	[scw, ticket #49]

usr.bin/fstat/fstat.c				1.66

	Fix fstat core dumps when some process holds a reference in a Linux
	ext2fs filesystem. PR#21301
	[aymeric, ticket #50]

xsrc/xfree/xc/fonts/util/bdftruncate.pl		1.4

	*shudder* install perl scripts... perhaps we shouldn't, but while we
	are, may as well give it a "#! /usr/bin/env perl" so it has a chance
	of working...  unfortunately, this even fixes PR#22578 ;-)
	[tron, ticket #48]

share/man/man4/options.4			1.233-1.234

	Document BEEP_ONHALT{,COUNT,PITCH,PERIOD}.
	[jmmv, ticket #51]

gnu/usr.bin/send-pr/send-pr.sh		1.21-1.22

	use mktemp(1) for safe temp files.
	oops; exit on failure with the previous.
	Fixes PR#21840.
	[reed, ticket #52]

distrib/mvme68k/miniroot/list			1.14

	Adapt to the replacement of gawk with nawk, source accessible as awk.
	[he, ticket #53]

sys/dev/pci/emuxki.c				1.32
sys/dev/pci/joy_pci.c				1.8
sys/dev/pci/pcidevs				1.618
sys/dev/pci/pcidevs.h				regen
sys/dev/pci/pcidevs_data.h			regen

	Added another SB Live! 5.1 soundcard and joystick version
	[martti, ticket #54]

sys/kern/kern_sig.c				1.191-1.193
sys/sys/siginfo.h				1.12

	Replace memset's of ksiginfo_t with KSI_INIT (which is the proper way 
	to initialize ksiginfo_t structures).
	Add the notion of an "empty" ksiginfo_t (one where on signo is filled 
	in).
	Add an initializer for them: KSI_INIT_EMPTY
	Add a predicate for them: KSI_EMPTY_P
	Don't bother storing empty ksiginfo_t's since they have no information.
	Change uses of KSI_INIT to KSI_INIT_EMPTY where no other information 
	other than the signo is being filled in.
	When a process is being traced (debugged) and a catchable signal 
	arrives, make sure to save its ksiginfo_t for eventual delivery.
	This makes debugging SA_SIGINFO signal handlers work.
	[matt, ticket #56]

usr.sbin/ipf/Makefile.inc			1.13
usr.sbin/ipf/ipfstat/Makefile			1.18
usr.sbin/ipf/ipnat/Makefile			1.23
usr.sbin/ipf/ippool/Makefile			1.7

	Move kvm library spec to Makefile.inc, so that it gets specified
	after the ipf library, since the ipf library depends on some functions
	from the kvm library.
	Fixes a build problem observed when building for sun2 (though I
	won't claim understanding why this doesn't show up elsewhere).
	[he, ticket #57]

sys/arch/i386/stand/misc/Makefile		1.5

	Fix uudecoding of object files.
	[groo, ticket #58]

sys/dev/pci/if_bge.c				1.67

	Fix mistaken arguments to bge_set_thresh(); the prior revision would
	pass the bge_softc * to a function expecting the struct ifnet*,
	triggering a panic every time the Rx-mitigation value is changed via
	sysctl.
	[jonathan, ticket #59]

sys/arch/sparc64/dev/pci_machdep.c		1.46

	OF_getprop can get only the first "reg" property with a statically
	allocated buffer, but prom_getprop cannot.
	This should fix a "kernel trap 30: data access exception" when you
	invoke a pcictl(8).
	[nakayama, ticket #60]

dist/dhcp/includes/cf/netbsd.h			1.4

	"gcc -m32 -mcpu=ultrasparc" defines __sparc_v9__, so __sparc64__ is
	more appropriate to indicate a 64-bit environment.
	[nakayama, ticket #61]

sys/arch/macppc/conf/GENERIC			1.173

	Enable "INSECURE" kernel option so that GENERIC kernels are capable of
	running XF4 servers.  while this isn't the best solution, it is the
	only one we have for the forseeable future, and there is long-standing
	precedent in the i386 port.
	[mrg, ticket #64]

sys/arch/i386/i386/identcpu.c			1.11

	- fix i386_intel_brand[]: it was missing a empty reserved entry at 0xD
	  causing Mobile Pentium 4 to be shown as a Mobile Celeron.
	- fix intel_family6_name() for brand=0xB && signature >= 0xF13
	- fix a potential out-of-bounds array reference
	[mrg, ticket #65]

xfree/xc/programs/xdm/config/Imakefile		1.2

	Provide a default tty under NetBSD-amd64, too. PR#25060
	[tron, ticket #63]

etc/rc.d/ipmon					1.11
etc/defaults/rc.conf				1.57

	Move ipmon's "-D" argument from "command_args" to "ipmon_flags" so that
	passing an (optional) filename argument (that must come last) works fine
	from $ipmon_flags. PR#25006
	[mrg, ticket #66]

distrib/sets/lists/xserver/md.sgimips		1.5

	Add mmapw - mmapr is already there.
	[hubertf, ticket #67]

usr.bin/lex/gen.c				1.18

	Typo in debugging output. PR#25065
	[christos, ticket #68]

sys/netinet/tcp_subr.c				1.161

	Invoking tcpcb's get erroneously free'd resulting in to_ticks <= 0 
	assertion.  PR#22551
	[christos, ticket #69]

sys/dev/ic/com.c				1.225

	Fix race condition introduced in rev 1.189; after the change, if there 
	is THRE interrupt occurs between the LSR read and IIR read, we won't 
	see the LSR_TXRDY bit when testing it in the variable 'lsr' and we 
	don't get interrupted again (as the corresponding bit in the IIR is 
	cleared by reading, except for some broken devices). PR#25010
	[enami, ticket #70]

dist/dhcp/includes/cf/netbsd.h			1.5

	Use _LP64 to indicate 64-bit platform.
	[nakayama, ticket #71]

x11/bin/xdm/config/Makefile			1.6
	mirror change in Imakefiles:  provide DEFAULTVT=vt05 for amd64 as well.
	[mrg, ticket #72]

xsrc/xfree/xc/programs/xdm/sessreg.c		1.2
	Add support for utmpx in current (since 1.6C).  OKed by tron.
	[markd, ticket #73]

	[mrg, ticket #62]

sys/dev/hpc/hpckbdkeymap.h			1.27

	Give the MobilePro 800 and MobilePro 880 correct keymaps:  fix the
	positioning of the cursor keys to match the keycaps, and make the cmdmap
	work correctly.
	[tv, ticket #74]

sys/arch/hpcmips/conf/Makefile.hpcmips.inc	1.2

	Allow the codegen option to be specified in the config file rather than
	being fixed at -mips2, by setting "makeoptions MIPSFLAGS"

	[tv, ticket #75]

sys/arch/hpcmips/dev/mq200debug.c		1.3

	Allow compilation without MQ200_DEBUG:  mq200_clknames is used outside 
	of debugging-only code.
	[tv, ticket #76]

sys/kern/kern_sysctl.c				1.171

	First caller to set a description on a node sets it.  This allows one
	setup function to set the description, even if the node has been
	instantiated elsewhere.  Or not, depending on the other that the setup
	functions are called.
	[atatat, ticket #77]

share/termcap/termcap.src			1.89

	Move the attribute end escape sequence to the start of the xterm
	initialisation sequence capability. PR#11052
	[jdc, ticket #78]

usr.bin/tput/tput.1				1.13

	Note in the BUGS section that some termcap entries don't have
	reset capabilities, so use init instead. PR#11052

	[jdc, ticket #79]

share/termcap/termcap.src			1.90

	Add termcap entry for Olivetti M10 and compatibles. PR#17739

	Factor out filetype checking code
	[mrg, ticket #82]

usr.bin/gzip/gzip.c				1.35

	print_list() was getting the compressed/uncompressed sizes backwards.
	PR#25072
	[mrg, ticket #83]

dist/ipf/tools/ipfstat.c			1.3

	Incorrect conditional -- misplaced ]. PR#25097
	[christos, ticket #84]

sys/kern/init_sysctl.c				1.25

	Clear out the struct kinfo_drivers before stuffing things into it.
	Avoids leaking garbage from the stack (left over from the earlier
	call to sysctl_locate()).
	[atatat, ticket #85]

sys/conf/files					1.663

	Create opt_sysctl.h which will hold sysctl related options.  I suspect
	most of these won't be used (well, the description related one will
	be), but it's good to formalize things.
	[atatat, ticket #86]

sys/sys/sysctl.h				1.117

	Include new opt_sysctl.h here, and use SYSCTL_NO_DESCR for eliminating
	properly declared descriptions.
	[atatat, ticket #87]

sbin/sysctl/sysctl.c				1.88

	Do nothing else for nodes with no children if -d is used (dflag is
	set).  Otherwise, some nodes (those with "printers") will also print
	the "use foo ..." message.
	[atatat, ticket #88]

	Weak aliases for sysctlfoobar() functions.
	[atatat, ticket #90]

	[atatat, ticket #89]

share/man/man4/dmoverio.4			1.6

	The device is called /dev/dmoverio, not /dev/dmover.
	[atatat, ticket #91]

	Don't copy the size that sysctl gave back directly, copy the size of
	the description.

	Many fixes for issues with sparc multi-processor support (includes
	fixes to make HyperSPARC MP work).
	[pk, ticket #179]

sys/sys/sysctl.h				1.123

	Add extra parentheses to make the cast correct.
	[atatat, ticket #180]

sbin/sysctl/sysctl.c				1.93

	Allocate adjusted size, not fixed size.
	[atatat, ticket #181]

sys/arch/i386/stand/mbr/mbr.S			1.6

	Put the 'mbr has bootselect table' marker into all versions of the
	mbr code.  Having the table in the 'standard' mbr allows fdisk to
	write in bootsel menu items and only ask about updating the mbr
	code before exit.
	Sysinst validates that the mbr code contains the bootselect table
	for all the mbr code variants it reads - because it might want to
	write the table and doesn't really want to make the validation
	dependant on what it is going to do later.
	PR#25235.
	[dsl, ticket #182]

sys/arch/vax/vax/machdep.c			1.146

	The second "console_device" node should really be called
	"booted_device".
	[atatat, ticket #183]

sbin/newfs/mkfs.c				1.88

	Fix support for creating APPLE_UFS filesystems with -v.
	This includes most of the support for creating fs level 3
	compatible filesystems, although there is currently no command
	line option to invoke it when not using apple_ufs.
	PR#23924.

sys/dev/scsipi/cd.c				1.201

	Some older devices do not understand the `disable block descriptor'
	bit in the mode sense request.  So fall back on mode sense data
	including a block descriptor section.
	PR#25210.
	[pk, ticket #186]

	Fix VAX kernel problem: always include <sys/param.h> first.
	[matt, ticket #187]

bin/pax/file_subs.c				1.43-1.44
bin/pax/tar.c					1.52

	PR#25188: pax-as-tar problem with trailing slashes
	The problem is with the program that generates the tar file:
	-rwxrwxrwx  1 root     wheel          0 Feb  8 16:46 faad2/aacDECdrop/
	It creates directory nodes without the 'd' bit set, so that pax thinks
	they are files and does the temporary name and dance with them. Added
	code to detect this condition, warn about it, and work around it.

	PR#25350: Treat the sticky bit specially as non-superusers
	cannot set it on non-directories (elvis-2.2_0 extraction failed)

	PR#25299: 1.5.3/i386 kernel set archives confuse -current pax
	PR#25310: tar can't unpack MS-DOS gzip files correctly

sys/netinet6/in6_pcb.c				1.64

	Fix per-PCB IPsec policy cache for FAST_IPSEC.
	The sys/netipsec policy-cache assumes that policy-cacheable PCBs
	always has a non-NULL inph_sp in the common PCB header.  So we must 
	do all the per-PCB policy cache calls when either (KAME) IPSEC, or  
	FAST_IPSEC is defined.
