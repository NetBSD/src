Known issues in NVMM, low priority in most cases.

====== KERNEL NVMM DRIVER ======

 * 32bit-PAE guests can misbehave on Intel, because we need to manually
   install the PDPTEs, and currently we don't do it. In practice they don't
   misbehave because the emulator never has to interfere with CR3.

 * Maybe we will want a way to return to userland when the guest TPR changes.
   On Intel that's not complicated, but on old AMD CPUs, we need to disassemble
   the instruction, and I don't like that.

 * We need a cleaner way to handle CPUID exits. It is not complicated to solve,
   but I'm still not sure which design is the cleanest.

 * Same for the MSRs.

====== LIBNVMM ======

 * There are still a few twisted corner cases we don't handle in the instruction
   emulator. For example if the guest makes an MMIO access relative to RSP, we
   must base the GVA on %SS and not %DS. This is tiring, and in practice, no
   guest is dumb enough to perform such accesses.
