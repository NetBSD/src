====== POINTER LEAKS ======

-- Change the permissions of /dev/ksyms, as discussed in:
       http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-kern/2018/01/17/msg022960.html

-- The address of a non-public section is leaked because of Meltdown,
   "jmp handler". This can easily be fixed by pushing the handlers into
   their own section.

-- Replace the "%p" fmt by something relative to the kernel section (if
   any). Eg, from
       printf("%p", &some_global_var); --> "0xffffffffe38010f0"
   to
       printf("%p", &some_global_var); --> ".data.4:0x8010f0"
   This eases debugging and also prevents leaks if a driver prints
   kernel addresses as debug (I've seen that already).

-- PPPoE sends a kernel address as host unique. (What is this shit.)

-- "netstat -nat" leaks kernel addresses.

-- Investigate some other tools.

-- Be careful with dmesg.

====== RANDOMIZATION ======

-- Randomize the PTE space.

-- Randomize the kernel main memory (VM_MIN_KERNEL_ADDRESS).

-- Randomize the direct map.

-- Randomize the PCPU area.

====== GENERAL ======

-- Sort the kernel sections by size, from largest to smallest, to save
   memory.

-- Add the "pkboot" command in the EFI bootloader.
