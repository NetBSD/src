	Pass the "boothowto" from the bootloader to the kernel.
	If (an old) bootloader did not pass the flags, check explicitly if we
	missed RB_USERCONF and invoke userconf_prompt() in MD code, as MI code
	already missed it.
	This fixes PR#46466.

	Setting mode by fchmod(2) will break on glusterfs-3.3 is we attempt
	to set atime and mtime at the same time. Detect that situation just
	like we detected ftruncate(2) and wipe atime and mtime if it occurs.

	don't crash if add_history is called from an empty line. Called from

	Switch luna68k wscons framebuffer driver to using rasops(9)
	APIs instead of deprecated rcons(4).  This allows "options

	functions. Tested on LUNA with 4bpp fb and LUNA-II with

	     asia
		    Changes for 2012 for Gaza & the West Bank (Hebron) and Syria

	     northamerica
		    Haiti following US/Canada rules for 2012 (and we're assuming,
		    for now anyway, for the future).

	Major changes from tzdata2011c to tzdata2011d:

	     Morocco does not observe DST from Jul 20 03:00 to
	     Aug 20 02:00 [2012].

	     Infrastructure changes to accommodate how the tz
	     code and data are released on IANA.

	- Fix same vnodes associated with multiple cookies
	The scheme used to retreive known nodes on lookup was flawed, as
	it only used parent and name. This produced a different cookie
	for the same file if it was renamed, when looking up ../ or when
	dealing with multiple files associated with the same name
	through link(2).

	We therefore abandon the use of node name and introduce hashed
	lists of inodes. This causes a huge rewrite of reclaim code,
	which do not attempt to keep parents allocated until all their
	children are reclaimed

	- Fix race conditions in reclaim
	There are a few situations where we issue multiple FUSE
	operations for a PUFFS operation. On reclaim, we therefore have
	to wait for all FUSE operation to complete, not just the current
	exchanges. We do this by introducing node reference count with
	node_ref() and node_rele().

	- Detect data loss caused by FAF
	VOP_PUTPAGES causes FAF writes where the kernel does not check
	the operation result. At least issue a warning on error.

	- Enjoy FAF shortcut on setattr
	No need to wait for the result if the kernel does not want it.
	There is however an exception for setattr that touch the size,
	we need to wait for completion because we have other operations
	queued for after the resize.

	- Fix fchmod() on write-open file
	fchmod() on a node open with write privilege will send setattr
	with both mode  and size set. This confuses some FUSE
	filesystem. Therefore we send two FUSE  operations, one for
	mode, and one for size.

	- Remove node TTL handling for netbsd-5 for simplicity sake. The
	code still builds on netbsd-5 but does not have the node TTL
	feature anymore. It works fine with kernel support on netbsd-6.
	
	- Improve PUFFS_KFLAG_CACHE_FS_TTL by reclaiming older inactive nodes.

	The normal kernel behavior is to retain inactive nodes in the
	freelist until it runs out of vnodes. This has some merit for
	local filesystems, where the cost of an allocation is about the
	same as the cost of a lookup. But that situation is not true for
	distributed filesystems. On the other hand, keeping inactive
	nodes for a long time hold memory in the file server process,
	and when the kernel runs out of vnodes, it produce reclaim
	avalanches that increase lattency for other operations.

	We do not reclaim inactive vnodes immediatly either, as they may
	be looked up again shortly. Instead we introduce a grace time
	and we reclaim nodes that have been inactive beyond the grace
	time.

	- Fix lookup/reclaim race condition.

	The above improvement undercovered a race condition between
	lookup and reclaim. If we reclaimed a vnode associated with a
	userland cookie while a lookup returning that same cookiewas
	inprogress, then the kernel ends up with a vnode associated with
	a cookie that has been reclaimed in userland. Next operation on
	the cookie will crash (or at least confuse) the filesystem.

	We fix this by introducing a lookup count in kernel and
	userland. On reclaim, the kernel sends the count, which enable
	userland to detect situation where it initiated a lookup that is
	not completed in kernel. In such a situation, the reclaim must
	be ignored, as the node is about to be looked up again.
	
	Fix hang unmount bug introduced by last commit.

	We introduced a slow queue for delayed reclaims, while the
	existing queue for unmount, flush and exist has been renamed
	fast queue. Both queues had timestamp for when an operation
	should be done, but it was useless for the fast queue, which is
	always used to run an operation ASAP. And the timestamp test had
	an error that turned ASAP into "at next tick", but nobody what
	there to wake the thread at next tick, hence the hang. The fix
	is to remove the useless and buggy timestamp test for fast
	queue.
	
	Rename slow sopreq queue into node sopreq queue, to refet the
	fact that is only intended for postponed node reclaims. When
	purging the node sopreq queue, do not call puffs_msg_sendresp(),
	as it makes no sense.

	Fix race condition between (create|mknod|mkdir|symlino) and
	reclaim, just like we did it between lookup and reclaim.
	
	Missing bit in previous commit (prevent race between
	create|mknod|mkdir|symlink and reclaim)
	
	Bump date for previous.
	New sentence, new line; remove trailing whitespace; fix typos;
	punctuation nits.
	
	Add PUFFS_KFLAG_CACHE_DOTDOT so that vnodes hold a reference on their
	parent, keeping them active, and allowing to lookup .. without sending
	a request to the filesystem.

	Enable the featuure for perfused, as this is how FUSE works.
	
	Missing bit in previous commit (PUFFS_KFLAG_CACHE_DOTDOT option
	to avoid looking up ..)
	[manu, ticket #438]

sys/dev/ic/vga.c				1.109

	Reset flip/flop using dedicated vga_reset_state() macro we already have.
	Explicit vga_raw_read() used here before was incorrect since it reads
	from *wrong* io handle!

	Fixes weird problem under VirtualBox where first switch to a different
	VT caused text mode color 0 (normally black) to become something else.
	[uwe, ticket #472]


etc/mtree/NetBSD.dist.base			1.98

	Do not create obsolete ./usr/include/quota directory anymore.
	[msaitoh, ticket #473]

sys/kern/subr_kmem.c				1.46 (via patch)

	split allocation lookup table to decrease overall memory used
	making allocator more flexible for allocations larger then 4kb
	move the encoded "size" under DEBUG back to the begining of allocated
	chunk
	[para, ticket #486]

sys/arch/i386/conf/GENERIC			1.1078

	Add uts(4)
	[sborrill, ticket #474]

sys/dev/pci/if_ath_pci.c			1.46

	Fix error branches in ath pci attachment.
	Should fix double pci_intr_disestablish if ath_attach fails.
	(Still not sure why ath_attach sometimes fails here.)
	[riastradh, ticket #476]

lib/libm/arch/i387/fenv.c			1.4
lib/libm/arch/x86_64/fenv.c			1.2

	Mask off the result of feenableexcept and fedisableexcept on x86.
	These shouldn't return bits outside FE_ALL_EXCEPT.
	[riastradh, ticket #477]

sys/dev/pci/if_wpi.c				1.53

	Fix error branch in wpi(4) firmware loading.
	Fixes panic if firmware is not available.
	[riastradh, ticket #478]

sys/arch/i386/stand/boot/boot2.c		1.58

	Fix i386 `boot' command to try the usual set of kernel names.
	Without this, the `boot' command will try only `netbsd', not
	`netbsd.gz', `netbsd.old', &c.

	Patch from PR port-i386/44562.
	[riastradh, ticket #479]

sys/dev/pci/if_msk.c				1.42

	Fix null pointer dereference in msk_rxeof.                         
                                                                   
	This triggers when processing an RX interrupt that was queued while
	stopping the interface, which caused my machine to panic last night.
	In this case, just drop the packet.

	From OpenBSD's if_msk.c rev. 1.71.                                  
	[riastradh, ticket #480]

sys/kern/subr_disk_mbr.c			1.43

	Apply workaround for installcd mountroot failure on some i386 machines.

	Don't create BSD style pty nodes by default anymore since ptyfs

	by default, to reduce diffs to -current.
