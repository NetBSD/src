#	$NetBSD: CHANGES-2.0.3,v 1.1.2.57 2007/04/08 22:28:05 bouyer Exp $

A complete list of changes from the NetBSD 2.0.2 release to the NetBSD 2.0.3
release.

File						Revision(s)
----						--------
sys/ufs/ufs/ufs_bmap.c				patch

	Fix a silent truncation problem that could cause corruption with large
	FFSv1 file systems.
	[mycroft, ticket #1035]

sys/sys/param.h					patch

	Welcome to 2.0.2_STABLE

sys/netinet/tcp_input.c				patch

	If an echoed RFC 1323 time stamp appears to be later than the current
	time, ignore it and fall back to old-style RTT calculation. This
	prevents ending up with a negative RTT and panicking later.
	[christos, ticket #1401]

sys/arch/sgimips/hpc/if_sq.c			1.21

	When adding or deleting multicast addresses, only change
	the address filter if the interface is marked RUNNING.
	Fixes PR#27678.
	[thorpej, ticket #939]

sys/arch/sgimips/hpc/if_sq.c			1.22-1.23
sys/arch/sgimips/hpc/sqvar.h			1.6-1.7

	Fix the HPC1 transmit logic, which was previously very broken.
	[rumble, ticket #1054]

sys/netinet6/nd6.c                              1.92

	Make sure that prefixes get purged. Fixes PR kern/21189,
	PR kern/25968, and PR kern/27873.
	[tron, ticket #1394]

usr.bin/telnet/telnet.c                         1.30

	Plug buffer overflows, ref. CAN 2005-0468 and 2005-0469.
	Patch from MIT/Kerberos (MITKRB5-SA-2005-001-telnet.txt).
	[tron, ticket #1410]

sys/arch/powerpc/powerpc/trap.c			1.106

	Drop the big lock in upcallret() like all the other platforms do.
	[chs, ticket #1066]

sys/netinet/tcp_input.c				patch

	Fix TCP performance problems introduced in ticket 1401.
	[chs, ticket #1445]

sys/arch/sparc64/sparc64/locore.c		1.197-1.204 via patch

	Various changes from NetBSD-current, revisions 1.197 to 1.204.
	Interrupt and soft-interrupt handling changes that appear to fix
	the "sleep forever" problem (PR port-sparc64/21750).
	[martin, ticket #1487]

sys/kern/uipc_mbuf2.c				1.19

	In m_pulldown avoid a prepend to the next mbuf in the chain if the
	result would still not have all data we want continous. Fixes PR#30098
	[martin, ticket #1503]

sys/arch/powerpc/powerpc/trap_subr.S		1.57

	Don't enable interrupts while calling trap() if the trapping frame
	didn't have them enabled either.
	Addresses PR#29559.
	[matt, ticket #1286]

sys/ufs/ext2fs/ext2fs_bmap.c			1.19

	getblk() can return NULL if we are the pagedaemon. Check for this.
	[bouyer, ticket #1355]

sys/kern/kern_descrip.c				1.132

	The file being closed is (fdp->fd_lastfile - i), not i. So compare
	(fdp->fd_lastfile - i) against fd_knlistsize. Otherwise we can
	call knote_fdclose() on a file descriptor that doesn't have a knote.
	This issue explains random panics I have had on process exit over the
	past few years.
	[wrstuden, ticket #1537]

sys/miscfs/kernfs/kernfs.h			1.24
sys/miscfs/kernfs/kernfs_vnops.c		1.108

	kernfs does not support mmap(), remove code that pretends that it does.
	[chs, ticket #1540]

sys/dev/ata/ata.c				1.69 via patch

	Close a window where (disks) interrupts could be enabled while the
	ATACH_TH_RUN flag is still set.
	[bouyer, ticket #1543]

sys/arch/sun3/dev/if_ie.c			1.42

	Avoid NULL pointer dereference in case of #if NBPFILTER == 0.
	Closes PR port-sun3/21699.
	[tsutsui, ticket #1874]

sys/arch/i386/i386/pmap.c			1.181

	Preload the referenced and modified bits when entering a page due to
	a fault.
	[chs, ticket #1979]

sys/arch/amd64/amd64/pmap.c			1.19
sys/arch/amiga/amiga/pmap.c			1.113
sys/arch/atari/atari/pmap.c			1.90

sys/arch/sun2/sun2/pmap.c			1.27
sys/arch/sun3/sun3/pmap.c			1.147
sys/arch/sun3/sun3x/pmap.c			1.87

	In pmap_enter(), preset the mod/ref bits based on the flags argument.
	This fixes PR kern/25640.
	[chs, ticket #1980]

sys/dev/verified_exec.c				1.6

	Use UIO_SYSSPACE for NDINIT.
	[kleink, ticket #1988]

sys/dev/audio.c					1.196 via patch

	Make sure buffer sizes are initialized correctly even when the pause
	state is explicitly set.
	Without this, the machine would crash for some audio hardware that
	needs to divide by the block size (e.g., cs4281.c/cs4280.c).
	[is, ticket #1990]

x11/bin/xdm/config/Makefile			1.9 via patch

	Install the following as executable scripts:
		GiveConsole TakeConsole Xsetup_0 Xsession Xwilling
	This fixes PR xsrc/30489.
	[tron, ticket #1986]

libexec/telnetd/ext.h				patch
libexec/telnetd/state.c				patch
libexec/telnetd/telnetd.c			patch

	Remove static local variable so its easier to correctly use strlcpy.
	[lha, ticket #2041]

usr.sbin/user/user.c				1.80

	Be consistent when deleting a non-existent group - tell if the group is
	non-existent.
	[agc, ticket #2024]

	[tron, ticket #2927]

src/gnu/usr.bin/cvs/libcvs/Makefile		patch
src/gnu/usr.bin/cvs/libdiff/Makefile		patch

	Don't install "libcvs" and "libdiff". This fixes build problems caused
	by the pullup of ticket #2927.
	[tron, ticket #2933]


usr.bin/su/su.1					1.44
usr.bin/su/su.c					1.65

	Set LOGNAME in the new environment (in addition to USER). PR#30670
	[kleink, ticket #2070]

sys/kern/uipc_usrreq.c				1.83

	uipc_usrreq: plug mbuf leak.
	[yamt, ticket #2940]

sys/arch/macppc/pci/pci_machdep.c		1.26

	Make PCI cards work on NetBSD-mappc systems with a "Grackle" bridge.
	[briggs, ticket #1329]

sys/netinet6/ah_aesxcbcmac.c			1.2

	IPsec-AH is always calculated using the same key in AES-XCBC-MAC.
	PR#30821
	[elad, ticket 5538]

lib/libz/inftrees.c				1.10
sys/lib/libz/inftrees.c				1.10    

	Return correct error on all zero length codes.
	[tron, ticket #5550]

sys/arch/alpha/alpha/pmap.c			1.211

	1. Disable the lazy allocation of lev1map in pmap_enter(), instead
	   doing it in pmap_create(), and freeing the lev1map in
	   pmap_destroy(). This means that pm_lev1map is consistent for the
	   life of the pmap.
	2. pmap_extract() now uses vtophys() for the kernel pmap. This avoids
	   having to lock the kernel pmap, since kernel PT pages are never
	   freed.
	3. Because of (1), pmap_asn_alloc() no longer needs to operate on a
	   locked pmap; pm_lev1map will never change over the life of the pmap,
	   and all other access to the pmap is done in per-CPU fields or with
	   atomic operations.
	4. Because of (3), pmap_activate() no longer needs to lock the pmap
	   to do its work, thus eliminating the deadlock with sched_lock
	   described in PR port-alpha/25599.  This is safe because we are
	   guaranteed that the pmap is still alive, since by definition an LWP
	   that uses that it is about to run.
	[thorpej, ticket #5528]

usr.sbin/amd/libamu/mkconf			1.4

	Embed machine and cpu architecture correctly from target host
	environment, not from build host.
	[nakayama, ticket #5560]

gnu/dist/cvs/src/cvsbug.in			1.3

	Fix vulnerability reported in SA16553 using the Red Hat patch.
	[tron, ticket #5613]

sys/miscfs/kernfs/kernfs_vnops.c		1.111

	Don't allow negative offsets when reading the message buffer, because
	it can allow reading arbitrary kernel memory.
	[christos, ticket #5633]

sys/miscfs/procfs/procfs_subr.c			1.59

	Simplify the code by:
	1. Checking for a negative uio_offset at the beginning. This really
	   does not affect us in most cases because we check that later too.
	2. Checking for attempts to write to init sooner and in all cases.
	[christos, ticket #5634]

sys/miscfs/kernfs/kernfs_vnops.c		1.112

	Also protect the ipsec ioctls from negative offsets to prevent panics
	in m_copydata(). Move the negative offset check from kernfs_xread() 
	to kernfs_read().
	[christos, ticket #5637]

distrib/notes/common/main			patch

	Clean up some ambiguous wording.

bin/sh/expand.c					1.68

	expbackq() was incorrectly backing up a temporary buffer
	when removing \n from the end of output of commands
	inside $(...) substitutions.  If the program output
	is n*128+1 bytes long (ending in a \n) then the code checks
	buf[-1] for another \n - looking an uninitialised stack.
	On a big-endian system an integer of value 10
	will satisfy this (unlikely on little endian) and can
	happen depending on the last code path to use a lot of stack!
	This caused the problem with newvers.sh on
	sparc64 after ', 2005' was added to the date list.
	PR#28852
	[martin, ticket #1418]

sys/netinet6/icmp6.c				1.111

	In icmp6_redirect_output(), sip6 is initialised to point to the
	data area of m0. But m0 may be freed later, so trying to use
	sip6 at the end of this function is wrong. My guess is that
	we want to reference the data area of m (the mbuf about to be
	send) instead at this point.  Fix a panic on Xen (where a data
	area of a mbuf may be unmapped when the mbuf is freed), and
	probably potential data/pool corruption in other cases.
	[bouyer, ticket #5938]
