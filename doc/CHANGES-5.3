	Welcome to 5.2_STABLE.
	[riz]

sys/fs/smbfs/smbfs_node.c			1.48, 1.49 via patch
sys/fs/smbfs/smbfs_node.h			1.13 via patch
sys/fs/smbfs/smbfs_vnops.c			1.83, 1.84 via patch

	Various fixes for smbfs:

	- Implement NGONE to fix caching issue described in PR kern/25070.
	  Mostly taken from FreeBSD r125637.
	- Revert revision 1.70 of smbfs_vnops.c to fix setattr to opened
	  direcotry.  In case of SMB_CAP_NT_SMBS, NOPEN is set after
	  smbfs_smb_ntcreatex() call.  If NOPEN is set in front, it will
	  immediately return by condition at do_open label.
	- In smbfs_close(), call smbfs_smb_close() and drop NOPEN bit in
	  the case of direcotry.  Otherwise smbfs_rmdir() fails when the
	  directory was opened.
	- Remove redundant vput() before vgone().
	- Avoid unnecessary mutex_exit() in smbfs_node_alloc().
	- Set NGONE bit to from-name vnode to invalidate the smbnode cache.

sys/fs/smbfs/smbfs_smb.c			1.44
sys/fs/smbfs/smbfs_subr.c			1.16
sys/fs/smbfs/smbfs_subr.h			1.21
sys/fs/smbfs/smbfs_vnops.c			1.85
sys/netsmb/smb.h				1.20

	Improve smbfs timestamp handling.
	Don't round timestamp to 2 seconds resolution if the server
	supports the CAP_INFOLEVEL_PASSTHRU capability.
	[nakayama, ticket #1824]

sys/netsmb/smb_iod.c				1.31 - 1.35
sys/netsmb/smb_rq.c				1.32

	Do not call callout_stop() unless the structure was previoulsy
	initialised for a non null timeout.
	Do initialise the callout when fetching a new request structure from
	the pool, not when starting the timer. Likewise, destroy the callout
	when giving back the item to the pool.
	Send data for as long as there is new data available.  Otherwise
	there was a danger of smb_iod_recvall() blocking, hence releasing
	the kernel lock, new data creeping into the queue, and a wakeup
	being missed (well, there's still a race, but since it's theoretical
	enough for me to never have encountered it, I'll rather solve it
	by periodic wakeups).
	defensive programming: wake up iod thread once a second "just in case"
	add comment to previous stating periodic wakeups can be nuked
	once smb is mpsafe.
	[nakayama, ticket #1825]

gnu/dist/grep/src/dfa.c				1.3
gnu/dist/grep/src/grep.c			1.14
gnu/dist/grep/src/search.c			1.4

	Change several int variables to size_t, ssize_t, or ptrdiff_t.
	This should fix the bug described in CVE-2012-5667 when an input
	line is so long that its length cannot be stored in an int
	variable.

	[apb, ticket #1838]

lib/librefuse/refuse.c				1.96 via patch

	FUSE seems to allow short writes without errors but PUFFS doesn't. Work
	around this by returning ENOSPC in case of a short write to avoid
	protocol errors. This change is based on problem analysis provided by
	Antti Kantee.
	This fixes PR lib/45129 by myself.
	[tron, ticket #1836]

sys/dev/bluetooth/bthidev.c			1.23, 1.24 via patch
sys/dev/bluetooth/btmagic.c			1.4, 1.5 via patch
usr.sbin/btdevctl/btdevctl.8			1.8 via patch

	when no link-mode is specified, explicitly set a mode of (int)0
	otherwise l2cap_setmode() will fail during connection setup
	for bthidev.c, this fixes a problem with Microsoft Wedge Touch
	mouse (which may not be able to authenticate)
	for btmagic.c, include this fix in case somebody tries that
	related to PR/47286
	[plunky, ticket #1835]

	[msaitoh, ticket #1842]

sys/external/bsd/ipf/netinet/ip_fil_netbsd.c	1.4 via patch

	 Sep Sun>=2 04:00 UTC.
	 New Zones Asia/Khandyga, Asia/Ust-Nera, Europe/Busingen.
	 Many changes affect historical time stamps before 1940.
