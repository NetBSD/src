	[riz]

sys/kern/subr_cprng.c				1.16

	Re-fix 'fix' for SA-2013-003.  Because the original fix evaluated a
	flag backwards, in low-entropy conditions there was a time interval
	in which /dev/urandom could still output bits on an unacceptably
	short key.  Output from /dev/random was *NOT* impacted.

	Eliminate the flag in question -- it's safest to always fill the
	requested key buffer with output from the entropy-pool, even if we
	let the caller know we couldn't provide bytes with the full entropy
	it requested.

	Advisory will be updated soon with a full worst-case analysis of the
	/dev/urandom output path in the presence of either variant of the
	SA-2013-003 bug.  Fortunately, because a large amount of other input
	is mixed in before users can obtain any output, it doesn't look as
	dangerous in practice as I'd feared it might be.
