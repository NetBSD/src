	ethernet: fixed the amazingly shitty ethernet performance with cheap
		Western Digital cards. (mycroft)
	i386: the /usr/src/sys/i386/boot/rmaouthdr script was not executable,

		work (ie. ^V^D<return>) (deraadt)
	fixed kvm_getprocs() to work after kvm_getprocs() and kvm_freeprocs()
		have been called already (cgd)
	tip(1): fix from Bakul Shah <bvs@BitBlocks.com> to make tip not dump

	various 8-bit patches from Andrew Chernov <ache@astral.msk.su>
		tty_compat.c is cleaned up, as is STOP+TIOCSTI
		in tty.c (deraadt)
	fd error reporting cleanup. (deraadt)
	fixed bad man page & syscall definition for getpgrp().
		(posix says it takes no args, and i don't argue...) (cgd)
	add change from Guido van Rooij <guido@gvr.win.tue.nl> so that
		io port access from user processes doesn't randomly
		work/fail.  now must open /dev/mem to get access. (cgd)
	isofs: apply patch from Jagane D. Sundar <jagane@netcom.com> to allow
		NFS-mounting of ISO 9660 (isofs) filesystems, and to
		fix a few small isofs bugs. (cgd)
	config(8): have config make kernel compilation directories in
		/sys/${MACHINE}/compile rather than /sys/compile (cgd)

		and so that it prints address family names (cgd)
	libc, tset(1): add new getcap routines to libc, adjust termcap build
		and tset(1) accordingly, and add cap_mkdb (cgd)
	move csu.${MACHINE} libraries into one subdir in /usr/src/lib (cgd)
	kernel: moved kernel architecture-dependent sub-directories into
		/sys/arch/${MACHINE}.  great for more archs! (cgd)

		to John Brezak (brezak@osf.org) for the patch.	(cgd)
	ed(1): 8-bit clean; no line-length limit; regex support for NULs (alm)
	sed(1): fixed NULL indirection (alm)
	fix "cpu" declarations in kernel config files so that they
		work as originally intended.  this means that only
		CPUs for which there is a CPU declaration (see kernel
		config files for examples) are supported by a kernel
		compiled with the config.  also, if you want the math
		emulator in your kernel, you now need the "MATH_EMULATE"
		option in the kernel config file.  (cgd)
	disklabel stuff in the kernel has been split up into arch
		indep & arch dep components. no more dos stuff in
		ufs_disksubr.c!		(deraadt)
	add packet size check for raw IP provided by Paul Antonov
		<apg@apg.kiae.su>, to fix the "traceroute foohost 2000
		causes panic" problem. (cgd)
	Fixed packet counters in if_ec, as noted by Mike J. Fuller
		<mike@sarah.lerc.nasa.gov>	(davidb)
	Modified the SCSI disk startup so that DEC disks (for example)
		are told to spin up _before_ they are asked if they're
		ready.	(davidb)
	mips, ns32k: Updated the rpc library to support MIPS and NS32k CPUs.
		(davidb)
	netiso, ethernet: applied various patches supplied by Havard Eidnes
		<Havard.Eidnes@runit.sintef.no> to generally fix ISO
		support, including: reception of ISO multicasts in with
		we ethernet driver, fixed CLNP Echo reponder, and
		netstat, ifconfig, and libc fixes (cgd)
	use the Athena "newsyslog" utility to rotate logs, rather than the
		old, cumbersome method in /etc/{daily,weekly,monthly} (cgd)
	replaced broken /usr/include/bitstring.h w/new version from
		Mike Murphy <mrm@optigfx.com> (cgd)
	added /usr/src/regress, for regression tests (cgd)
	add Yuval Yarom's changes (originally for BSD/386) for advisory
		record locking on NFS files.  Note that this DOES NOT
		support network locking, only local advisory locks. (cgd)
	fix /bin/ls; is clobbered first env. var. if given no filename args
		given. patch from Bob Willcox <bob@obiwan.uucp>. (deraadt)
	mail.local can now use username.lock files as well as flock().
		Use the -l flag in your favorite sendmail.cf file. (deraadt)
	kernel: don't remake newvers and relink kernel if nothing has changed
		(cgd)
	sup(1): fix SUP to not need any version of crypt. Use
		"make MAKE_EXPORT=1" to build a SUP for export. (brezak)

		array from <stacey@guug.de>. (deraadt)
	add patch00149: sd/cd drivers printed incorrect blocknumbers when they
		hit errors. From <julian@jules.dialix.oz.au>. (deraadt)
	/etc/localtime is now created from by "make distribution" (deraadt)
	more(1): fixed /usr/bin/more to not play with magic numbers from
		executables directly.  It now uses the N_BADMAG() macro.
		(deraadt)
	lpr(1): fixed lpr's dealings with magic numbers. It now no longer
		accesses exec.a_magic directly, and it knows about modern "ar"
		files rather than the old ones (deraadt)
	use EXPORTABLE_SYSTEM instead of MAKE_EXPORT to build crypt-free SUP.
		Just like the rest of the system. (brezak)
	tty structures are allocated dynamically. The d_ttys field in cdevs[]
		now has an extra level of indirection. The pty and com
		drivers allocate pty's dynamically, the pccons driver does
		not. Check out the "ttys" field in vmstat -m. (deraadt)
	kernel: make sleeps during FIFO open interruptable (cgd)
	kernel: various patches to kernel files to make things compile
		with GCC-2.3.3 (proven)

	telnet(1): sending simple telnet commands fixed.  patch originally
		from Jonathan Stone <jonathan@CS.Stanford.EDU> (cgd)
	execve(2): replace execve with new one, based on work by Wolfgang
		Solfrank <ws@tools.de>, but beaten up a good amount by cgd.
		(after several iterations of beating have gone on,
		this code is *really* differnt...) (cgd)
	update kvm library for the new exec, and add a kvm_getenv function,
		to get a process's environment var list.  ps and w
		apply strvis() to args/environment before printing (cgd)
	ps(1): give ps an 'e' option, to print the environment variables
		of processes (cgd)
	add vt300 to termcap.src (brezak)
	stty(1): fixed stty so that setting "ispeed" works. (cgd)
	i386: move i386 signal trampoline code from the pcb to the top of
		the stack.  at the same time, implement copying out
		of the signal trampoline code, on process creation. (cgd)
	libg++: shut up libg++ "make"'s whining (cgd)
	allow user to specity that programs depend on c++ sources
		(previously only could be done for libraries) (cgd)
	fix library "make depend" problem, in which it wasn't
		generating dependencies for profiled .o files (cgd)

	add /lib/rpcsvc for upcoming rusers/rup clients and daemons (brezak)
	revert the "syncing disks" message on reboot to its original,
		more informative, form (cgd)
	fix /usr/include/rpcsvc/klm_prot.x so it compiles. (brezak)
	add /usr/libexec/rpc.rstatd, rpc.rusersd, rpc.rwalld. (brezak)
	add /usr/bin/rup, rusers, rwall(changes). (brezak)
	add LIBRPCSVC to bsd.prog.mk. (brezak)
	removed bugs and memory leaks from directory functions (proven)
	tip(1): make tip obey Taylor UUCP's locking conventions.  Patch from
		Peter da Silva <peter@taronga.com>, patchkit
		patch #139. (cgd)
	tip(1), getty(8), kernel: patch from David Greenman and Rod Grimes
		(davidg@implode.rain.com and rgrimes@agora.rain.com) to support
		57600 and 115200 baud in the kernel, tip, and getty.

		use "options MCLSHIFT=10" in your kernel config.
		this is patchkit patch #166. (cgd)
	remove /usr/local and /usr/contrib from root's path, and
		also give root and operator "sane" group ids.  (cgd)

		is currently not in our tree).	And don't blame me if (though
		it's unlikely) your existing symlinks all barf because they
		have dirty spare fields.  (mycroft)
	scsi: changed aha scsi driver to reduce the card's bus-on time from the

		pages.	Writing to one of these pages on an i[34]86 system
		tends to cause an instant reboot... (andrew)
	gzip(1), tar(1): brought in versions of Bmake'd versions of GNU gzip
		and tar off of freefall. These understand the .gz suffix for
		gzip'ed archives. (brezak)
	uucpd(8): from Net2. (brezak)

	applied Paul Kranenburg's VM deadlock patches from the patchkit
		[patch00147, parts 2-4 - part 1 was already applied]
		(andrew)
	i386: fixed new i386 interrupt code to only do verbose statistics-
		gathering when compiled with INTR_DEBUG.  also, use
		local labels for internal branches, so profiling works
		better.	 (cgd)
	i386, ethernet: add support for David Greenman's if_ed wd80[01]3 and
		3c503 i386 ethernet driver.  modify it to allow the "iosiz"
		to override the probed shared memory size, to help
		compatibility with clone boards (cgd)
	i386: change i386 interrupt vectors names so that they being with "X"
		instead of "V", like every other BSD system... (cgd)

		value from an fgets(). fix from <sjg@zen.void.oz.au> (deraadt)
	first part of merge of amiga code, sys/arch/amiga. Full merge will
		require some changes outside too, as well as some renameing
		in sys/arch/amiga to avoid conflicts with existing modules (mw)
	i386: wd controller driver - major rewrite of timeout code to use
		DELAY(). added code to reset controller if it times
		out. patches sent in by many people. (deraadt)
	make the rlist code go away.  it wasn't useful in the place

		the last of the games.) [cgd 19950422]
	banner(6): shouldn't print a "Message:" prompt if input isn't
		stdin.	From Masanobu Saitoh <saitoh@spa.is.uec.ac.jp>
		in PR #982.  Also, fix usage strings to note that "width"
		argument to "-w" flag isn't really optional. [cgd 19950422]
	Make sure that zoneinfo files are installed with correct perms
		(read-only, by everyone). (fixes PR #984.) [cgd 19950422]
	alpha: Merged many more changes in from the alpha port; made sys/lib

		process argument copying code into a function (copyargs).

	libc: added xdr_{,u_}int{16,32}_t() functions to libc's RPC code
		(for internal use only, at this point).	 made various

		form. [cgd 19950429]
	user_from_uid() and group_from_gid() prototypes now provided
		by pwd.h and grp.h, respectively, if _POSIX_SOURCE and

	Split egid out of supplemental group list because POSIX.1 requires

		the group list.	 Changed getgrouplist(3) to not duplicate
		the primary group. [jtc 19950531]
	i386: integrate patch from Lon Willett for pcvt. This is part of the
		the 3.20 release. It "welds" the cursor in DDB, fixes some
		keymappings, doesn't clear the startup screen and when screen

	amiga: changed the install root image size from 880k to 1760k.
		Users can use miniroot (and probably will) so the major

		the PROFDIR environment variable. [jtc 19951121]
	incorporated diffs to IP networking code for 64-bit cleanliness.
		[cgd 19951121]

	hp300: made COMPAT_HPUX partially work.	 This is a
		checkpoint/snapshot, done with the intent that others
		will be able to track the code more easily.  Several
		HP-UX 9.x executables tested work "OK".	 Much more
		work yet to be done.  [thorpej 19951128]
	atari: added support for a separate {prof,stat}clock [leo 19951201]
	atari: now using more functional fpe support [leo 19951201]

	integrated version 9.11.5 of termcap database. [jtc 19951204]
	Changed sys/scsi/sd.c and sys/scsi/cd.c to use a 6-byte
		read/write cdb if the transfer request will fit, and
		the 10-byte cdb otherwise.  In sdattach(), note
		if the device is "ancient".  Implement sdminphys()
		which shortens the transfer to fit in a 6-byte
		cdb on "ancient" devices.  Fixes problems with
		rejected commands on many Emulex ESDI->SCSI bridges.
		[thorpej 19951207]
	m68k: Moved the m68k bcopy, ovbcopy, and memcpy functions out of each
		port's locore.s and centralized them in m68/m68k/copy.s.
		[thorpej 19951210]
	hp300: some cleanup in locore.s and others.  Changes are geared
		towards finding common ground between the m68k ports
		and pulling them out into <m68k/m68k/...>.
		[thorpej 19951211]
	Added -Werror to bsd.sys.mk, so programs which use the
		NetBSD build environment build with -Werror.
		[cgd 19951212]
	vax: Added support for MicroVAX III (VAX 3600/3800/3900).
		Walk slowly towards using new config everywhere. [??? 199512??]
	changed NFS code to work on 64-bit systems.  (Really
		just changed the code so that structures, etc., used
		in implementing the wire protocol used fixed-size
		types.) [cgd 19951219]
	started a collection of machine-independent TurboChannel
		code, to be shared between the pmax and alpha ports.
		[cgd 19951219]
	fixed strftime's %u format to expand to a single digit.

		for loops to conform to the newer ANSI scoping rules.
		[chopps 19951229]
	added $mrouted_flags to /etc/netstart and use them in /etc/rc
		to start mrouted like $routed_flags are used to

		written by Bertram Barth, based on TMSCP code.
		[ragge 19960106]
	atari: Added nvram driver. [leo 19960106]
	upgraded zoneinfo code to tzcode96a. [jtc 19960108]
	upgraded zoneinfo data to tzdata96a. [jtc 19960108]
	New generic disk framework.  Highlights:
		- New metrics handling.	 Metrics are now kept in the new
		  `struct disk'.  Busy time is now stored as a timeval, and
		  transfer count in bytes.
		- Storage for disklabels is now dynamically allocated, so that
		  the size of the disk structure is not machine-dependent.
		- Several new functions for attaching and detaching disks, and
		  handling metrics calculation.
		Old-style instrumentation is still supported in drivers
		that did it before.  However, old-style instrumentation
		is being deprecated, and will go away once the userland
		utilities are updated for the new framework.
		For usage and architectural details, see the disk(9) manual
		page. [thorpej 19960107]
	Added copy(9), fetch(9), and store(9) manual pages, based on
		a suggestion from Kenneth Stailey. [thorpej 19960108]

		aic7xxx-based SCSI controllers from Michael Graff.
		[thorpej 19960112]
	sys/lib/libsa: Splitted some sources files containing more than
		one function. Allowing for a possible decrease of the
		bootloader size. closes PR #1817. [leo 19960113]
	m4(1): handle multi-character quote and comment delimiters
		Patch forwarded to Ozan Yigit  [pk 19960113]
	sparc: added "mountroot hook" for dealing with a device's
		special needs before (*mountroot)() is called.
		Make the floppy driver register a mountroot hook used
		to eject the floppy and prompt user for filesystem
		floppy if it's the root device.	 Add better disklabel
		handling to floppy driver.  [thorpej 19960114]
	netinet: added net.inet.ip.forwsrcrt sysctl.  If zero,
		the system will not forward source-routed packets.
		The name is consistent with the BSD/OS sysctl
		that does the same thing.  [thorpej 19960115]
	netinet: added net.inet.ip.directed-broadcast sysctl, slightly
		modified from a patch submitted by Darren Reed.
		[thorpej 19960115]

		 flavour of msdosfs an option passed by mount.
		[leo 19960119]

	sendmail(8): upgraded sendmail to version 8.7.3.  [mrg 19960122]
	redesigned z8530 serial driver to make it attach child devices
		for keyboard, mouse, or plain tty. [gwr 19960123]
	Move disk-specific ioctls from <sys/disklabel.h> to <sys/dkio.h>
		which is implicitly included by <sys/ioctl.h>.	Define
		and implement DIOCLOCK, which is used to lock/unlock
		a disk pack.  Teach several drivers and the eject(1)
		program about the new interface.  SCSI disk driver now
		has ability to eject removable media with software.
		CD-ROM drivers maintain compatibility with the old CD-ROM
		lock/unlock/eject interface.  [thorpej 19960130]
	cmp(1): cmp -s no longer complains about missing filess. [mrg 19960201]
	changed names of timespec struct's fields from ts_* to tv_*

	ccd(4): add experimental data mirroring support, mostly from
		Satoshi Asami and Nisha Talagala, with some changes
		by me.	[thorpej 19960201]
	syslogd(8): added -s flag -- this makes syslogd open only the unix
		domain socket and not the network, which is important on

		to be any of the first 32 instead of first 8. [briggs 19960211]
	hp300: New, better interrupt handling code.  Eliminates most
		hard-coded driver references in locore.s.  [thorpej 19960213]
	audio: New ioctl AUDIO_PERROR (playback error count); new mode
		flag AUDIO_PLAY_ALL to indicate that all samples should
		be played rather than time correcting with silence.
		[jtk 19960216]
	nfs: Rick Macklems's NFSv3 code from Lite2 brought in [fvdl 19960218]
	i386: Virtual 8086 mode kernel support, library support added to i386

	eisa: added better EISA bus autoconfiguration support.  Mostly
		taken from PR #1959.  [cgd 19960226]
	Replace config_found() with config_found_sm(), which adds a
		cfmatch_t to the argument list.	 This allows easy
		'submatching', which will eliminate a fair bit of
		slightly tricky duplicated code from various busses.
		config_found() is now a #define in sys/device.h, which
		invokes config_found_sm().  [cgd 19960227]
	sparc: add support for P4 framebuffers [thorpej 19960227]
	sendmail(8): updated sendmail to 8.7.4. [mrg 19960228]

		of subdevices) machine-independent.  [cgd 19960227]
	added preliminary support for PCI-PCI bridges.	[cgd 19960227]
	sun3: added PMAP_PREFER for performance boost on the
		Sun3/260 machines.  [gwr 19960228]
	atari: The Atari-port now has a NetBSD-bootloader that can be installed

		directly. [leo 19960228]
	vax: Support for VAX 11/780 - 11/785 added. Device driver
		for DHU11 serial card, written by Ken Wellsch, added.
		[ragge 19960302]
	i386: changed autoconfiguration so that isa, eisa, and pci busses
		attach to mainbus which attaches to root, rather than
		attaching root directly.  [cgd 19960303]
	added _MACHINE and _MACHINE_ARCH to each port's include/param.h.

		map and access device I/O and memory spaces.  [cgd 19960308]
	i386: changed faked-up disklabel to include BIOS partitions
		in order to allow people to mount DOS partitions on
		disks with no NetBSD partition.	 [ghudson 19960309]
	i386: isa - reworked multi-port board interface with 'com' driver
		so that (among other things), 'flags 1' is no longer

		multiport board.  Removed understanding of 'flags 1'
		from com.c.  [cgd 19960310]
	pc532: reported pmap.c, removed double mapping, improved copyin
		copyout, etc. [phil 19960214]
	pc532: moved port to use MI ncr5380 driver. [phil 19960311]
	gnu: imported libg++-2.7.1 [phil 19960309]
	Added the total number of sectors to disklabel's text
		representation of a label, since calculating based on
		the geometry isn't always accurate.  [ghudson 19960314]
	atari: now uses the MI ramdisk driver. [leo 19960314]
		finished prototyping the mi portion of the kernel. Things to
		do is fix the _conf.h crud and cleanup the printf() debugging

	pica: Import of Per Fogelstrom's port to the Acer pica r4400/isa
		[jonathan 19960313]
	renamed fdopen() to filedescopen() so that it does not collide

	New device attachment scheme.
		- split softc size and match/attach out from cfdriver into
		  a new struct cfattach.
		- new "attach" directive for files.*.  May specify the name of
		  the cfattach structure, so that devices may be easily
		  attached to parents with different autoconfiguration
		  semantics.
		Changes to config(8) and kern/subr_autoconf.c from
		Chris Demetriou <cgd@NetBSD.org>. [thorpej 19960316]
	New libkvm/savecore.
		1) savecore will not access the dump or live-kernel directly.
		   It will always use the kvm-functions. Allowing it to work on
		   kernels that don't have a 1-1 PA-VA mapping.
		2) the kvm-lib has some additional functions to accomplish 1
			- kvm_dump_mkheader()
			- kvm_dump_wrtheader()
			- kvm_dump_inval()
		3) the file formats of the dump generated by the kernel and
		   the dump generated by savecore have been changed. The file
		   format now looks like the format produced for 'normal' core
		   dumps.
		Ports not yet supporting the new kvm-format will be using
		libkvm.old/savecore.old for the time being. [leo 19960317]
	config(8): Add BSDI-style expression support to optional file
		specifiers.  Code mostly taken from the parts of BSDI's
		'config' which are freely-distributable (under the LBL/UC

		Instead of simple option lists used to include optional
		files, you can now use parentheses, &, |, and !.

	sun3:	Reworked the autoconfiguration design to allow control
		over the order of attachment calls on mainbus and obio.
		This should allow the eventual removal of several hacks
		to get some devices configured before autoconfig. Also,
		adapted to (and took advantage of) the new attachment
		interface by "carving up" the "ie" and "si" drivers.
		Added drivers for the interrupt register (intreg) and
		the memory error register (memerr).  [gwr 19960326]
	sys/dev/pci: changed the interfaces used by PCI device drivers,

	scsi: Added bew SCSI changer driver and userland controller
		utility.  [thorpej 19960402]
	change 'alldevs' and 'allevents' lists to be TAILQs, rather
		than home-grown lists.	[cgd 19960403]
	change config_found(), config_rootfound(), and config_attach()
		to return the 'struct device *' of the newly attached
		device rather than an int (for the former two) or
		void (for the latter).	Change several drivers
		to take advantage of this, to remove hackish
		open-coded variants of config_found().	[cgd 19960404]
	pc532: added Ian Dall's ieee fp support to pc532 port. [phil 19960404]
	Applied PR #2006 (from me, with some fixes) to rename 'fsck' to
		'fsck_ffs', so that in the future 'fsck' can be used
		as a wrapper to call the correct file system checker.
		For now, fsck is link to fsck_ffs.  [cgd 19960404]
	vax: Added DZ11 serial line drivers. Written by Ken Wellsch.
		[ragge 19960408]
	eisa: changed the interrupt attachment/detachment

		[veego 19960422]
	amiga: changed the speed calculations of the builtin serial
		driver to allow any baudrate the hardware allows, and
		to forbid two baudrates (50 and 75) which the hardware
		does NOT support but which the old speed conversion
		table pretended to support. [is 19960423]
	amiga: made the mainboard mice real devices instead of
		pseudo-devices. [is 19960424]
	ep driver: split up driver into eisa, isa, and pci front ends, and

	atari: added edahdi, a simple editor to modify partition id's on
		an AHDI labeled disk [leo 19960519]
	atari: added a miniroot distribution. It is basically the same as
		the MI-miniroot but because I have only 1Mb to play with,
		some of the tools (awk,cut,grep,..) didn't fit and the
		scripts have been rewritten to deal with this. Also added
		an option to install from a 'normal' (== hd/mo/...) disk
		partition to allow people to gather the sets using the

		From Matthias Drochner [fvdl 19961020]
	New bus.h implementation/interface:
		- No more distinction between i/o-mapped and memory-mapped
		  devices.  It's all "bus space" now, and space tags
		  differentiate the space with finer grain than the
		  bus chipset tag.
		- Add memory barrier methods.
		- Implement space alloc/free methods.
		- Implement region read/write methods (like memcpy to/from
		  bus space).
		This interface provides a better abstraction for dealing with
		machine-independent chipset drivers.  [thorpej 19961021]
	i386: eisa - implement eisa_mem_{alloc,free}(), which provides
		a method for allocating physical address space suitable
		for programming decoders on memory-mapped EISA devices.
		[thorpej 19961021]
	add a MNT_NOCOREDUMP/'nocoredump' mount flag/option, which prevents
		crashing processes from dumping core on file systems
		with it set.  [cgd 19961023]
	restore(8): now uses unique temp files in most cases. [lukem 19961024]
	netinet: change length and offset fields in headers to be
		unsigned so that we can actually use the max IP
		packet size.  From Kevin M. Lahey <kml@nas.nasa.gov>
		[thorpej 19961024]
	netinet: sanity check packet length against IP_MAXPACKET
		on incoming and outgoing packets, and discard as appropriate.
		Based on a patch from Bill Fenner <fenner@parc.xerox.com>
		Add a `too long' counter to IP stats. [thorpej 19961024]
	nfs: change default for nfs mounts to not do a connect on the socket.
		Add option -C to force a connected mount. Now option -c
		is still there, but it is the default. Maybe amd should
		be changed similarly. [christos 19961027]
	ffs: Performance enhangement: When freeing an indirect block, there
		is no need to write it (synchronously, no less!) before
		tossing it.  From Kirk McKusick <mckusick@McKusick.COM>.
		[thorpej 19961105]
	i386: APM - rename APM_NOIDLE option to APM_NO_IDLE, and add an
		APM_NO_STANDBY option for people with buggy BIOSes that
		do bad things with standby mode.  [cgd 19961106]
	rename remrq() to remrunqueue() for consistency with setrunqueue()
		(which was renamed from setrq() by Lite).  Also, move
		its prototype from vm/vm_extern.h to sys/proc.h so that
		it's in the same place as prototypes for related
		functions.  [cgd 19961106]
	ping(8): handle SIGINFO and print out ping statistics when
		a SIGINFO is received.	[cgd 19961106]
	rlogind(8) now uses .rhosts for root, implements -a (check hostnames),
		-L (log successful iruserok() auths), and logs unsuccessful
		iruserok() auths.  [lukem 19961108]
	atari:  The Hades is now a supported system although driver
		support is still minimal; only SCSI,PCI-ET4000,floppy and
		parallel-printer.  [leo 19961109]
	sparc:	switch to kernel crash dump format as described
		in <sys/kcore.h>. [pk 19961110]
	kernel: Implement bitmask_snprintf(), which takes a value and a string
		representing the names of those bits, prints them into a
		buffer provided by the caller, and returns a pointer to
		that buffer.  Functionality is identical to that of the
		(non-standard) `%b' printf() format, which will be
		deprecated.  Also, rename the non-exported function
		ksprintn() to ksnprintn(), and change it to use a buffer
		provided by the caller, rather than at static buffer.

	Default syslog.conf doesn't send authpriv to anywhere except
		/var/log/secure, as well as other cleanups. Install
		the initial logs with sensible permissions. [lukem 19961120]
	finger(1): add -h (show hostnames in short listing), -o (reverse
		of -h), and cleanup the code. [lukem 19961121]
	pwd_mkdb(8): add -d directory, to override '/'. Inspired by
		FreeBSD. [lukem 19961122]
	pwd_mkdb(8): print a warning to stderr if a YP inclusion
		specifies a value of 0 for uid or gid, per
		discussion on tech-userlevel. [thorpej 19961124]
	ftp(1): add variable sized hash marks, user-friendly transfer time
		printing (from FreeBSD), -p to switch to passive mode,
		printing of transfer stats upon receiving SIGINFO,
		-a for anon autologin (from OpenBSD), autofetch of
		URL & classic style files (from OpenBSD via thorpej),
		and other cleanups. [lukem 19961125]
	alpha: added support for the eb164 system type.	 [cgd 19961125]
	libwrap: added from tcp_wrappers 7.4 distribution.  [mrg 19961127]
	inetd(8): use libwrap and /etc/hosts.{allow.deny}, ala tcpd.
		[mrg 19961127]
	ftp(1): add "preserve" mode, "lpwd", confirmation overrides
		('a' = answer yes to rest of current xfer, 'p' = turn off
		prompt mode), code cleanups. [lukem 19961128]
	i386: implement PCI-Host (pchb) and PCI-ISA (pcib) bridge
		drivers for the i386.  Attempt to attach the ISA
		bus to a pcib, if available.  [thorpej 19961127]
	fdformat(1): add floppy diskette formatting program and ioctl
		command structures [jtk 19961129]
	i386: add support for floppy diskette formatting facility.
		[jtk 19961129]
	Changed MAXBSIZE back to MAXPHYS, per PR #1718.	 [thorpej 19961201]
	scsi: Implemented simple scsi_xfer queueing mechanism in the ahc driver
		to avoid presenting a resource shortage to the
		upper layer scsi drivers.  [thorpej 19961201]
	nfs: Performance improvement from Doug Rabson/FreeBSD.
		Improve the queuing algorithms used by NFS'
		asynchronous i/o.  The new mechanism uses a queue for
		each mount point.  All asynchronous i/o goes through
		this queue which preserves the ordering of requests.
		A simple mechanism ensures that the iods are shared
		out fairly between active mount points.
		Reviewed/integrated/approved by fvdl@NetBSD.org.
		[thorpej 19961202]
	nfs: Make NFSSERVER w/o NFSCLIENT work.	 Fixes PR1308
		and PR1780 (Kenneth Stailey and Chris Demetriou,
		respectively).	Fix suggested by Chris Demetriou,
		and munged a bit by me.	 [thorpej 19961202]
	i386: Make profiling work for some low-level functions;
		use <machine/asm.h> in the kernel as well as in
		userland (from Jonathan Stone) [fvdl 19961203]
	i386: Extend CPU recognition code, and make it more easily
		extensible for future types. [fvdl 19961203]
	Default syslog.conf now sends authpriv to /var/log/authlog
		instead of /var/log/secure, as per other systems.
		Suggested by mycroft. [lukem 19961204]
	sendmail(8):  upgraded to version 8.8.4.  [mrg 19961204]
	amd(8): make it work on the alpha, by beating some 64-bit

	amiga: add a DraCo version of the com.c driver. [is 19961204]
	amiga: add a first version of a bootblock compilable from within
		NetBSD [is 19961204]
	ftp(1): add progress bar (toggled with "progress"). "ls" is
		now equivalent to "nlist" not "dir". Parse multi-line
		SYST/MDTM/SIZE replies correctly, closing [PR bin/741].
		[lukem 19961206]
	hp300: dynamically compute psl values for calls to

		[mrg 19961208]
	lex(1): upgrade to flex 2.5.4. [mikel 19961209]
	scsi: add a max_target member to struct scsi_link, filled in by
		host adapter drivers to indicate the maximum target
		they can address.  Use this value to dynamically allocate
		data structures, rather than using a hard-coded value of
		8 targets.  Allows MI SCSI to deal with targets > 7 now.

	hp300: Snapshot of new config for NetBSD/hp300.	 This isn't
		quite finished yet.  We're about 75% there.  SCSI and
		HP-IB are not yet supported in a new config kernel; some
		autoconfiguration hackery has to be done there, yet.
		These changes are enough to network boot a diskless kernel.
		New config glue is enabled with the "NEWCONFIG" kernel
		option.	 If that option is not present, an old config
		kernel will be built.  Any kernel configured with
		config(8) will automatically pick up the NEWCONFIG option
		from std.hp300.	 [thorpej 19961217]

	hp300: completely cut over to new-style autoconfiguration,
		and delete config.old (finally!).  [thorpej 19970130]
	nfs: Change NFSCLIENT -> NFS.  We "mount -t nfs", and the vfs ops
		are "nfs_vfsops".  [thorpej 19970130]
	Implement machine-independent mountroothook code, derived
		from similar code implemented by me in the sparc
		and x68k ports.	 This is used to execute a special
		operation before a device is mounted as root (such
		as ejecting a floppy, and prompting for a new disk.)
		[thorpej 19970130]
	Implement a new machine-independent setroot() function, which
		sets the root/swap device and, optionally, the
		root file system.  "options GENERIC" is obsolete.
		[thorpej 19970130]
	Implement a new, fault-tolerant vfs_mountroot(), which is
		capable of determining the root file system type
		if the operator didn't specify one in the kernel
		configuration file.  Change file system mountroot
		functions to return errors properly, rather than
		panic'ing.  If the file system can not be mounted,
		the operator will be prompted for a root device
		and file system type, or be given the option to halt
		the system.  [thorpej 19970130]
	config(8): Change config(8) to support generic vfs_mountroot() and
		machine-independent setroot().	File systems are
		now configured with the "file-system" keyword.
		Kernel configurations must now always specify
		a root device, which may be wildcarded ("?").
		Operator may specify a root file system type,
		as well.  [thorpej 19970130]
	su(1): Allow any user to su to root if group 0 exists but has no
		members.  [ghudson 19970131]
	m68k: add copypage() and zeropage() to copy.s, which are
		optimizes bcopy/bzero functions for aligned NBPG-byte
		copy/zero operations.  Make m68k ports use them
		consistently, garbage-collecting redundant copies.
		[thorpej 19970201]
	m68k: add mappedcopy{in,out}() to m68k common code area.
		These functions use page mapping to speed up
		large copyin/copyout operations. [thorpej 19970201]
	Profile-driven optimization: don't always define KMEMSTATS.
		This leads to a significant improvement in the
		performance of the MALLOC()/FREE() macros, used in
		many critical paths. [tls/cgd 19970201]
	hp300: implement and use _splraise().  [thorpej 19970202]

	Update and enhancement to the mbuf code, to support use of non-cluster
		external storage.  Highlights:
		- additional "void *" argument to (*ext_free)(), an opaque

		  by MEXTADD() (add external storage to mbuf), MEXTMALLOC()
		  (malloc() external storage and attach to mbuf), and
		  MEXTREMOVE() (remove external storage from mbuf).
		- completely new external storage reference counting
		  mechanism; mclrefcnt[] is gone.

		buffers up the network stack, and reduce/eliminate copies
		in certain code paths (e.g. NFS writes).

	netinet: Implement a compressed state engine for TCP, based
		on code written by David Borman for BSD/OS.  This
		compressed state engine is currently used to hold
		state for embryonic TCP connections.  Rather than
		creating a socket/TCB for the incoming SYN, it is
		placed into the compressed state engine.  A TCB is
		only created once the 3-way handshake has been completed.
		Among other things, this provides complete protection from
		"SYN flood attacks" without the need to drop half-open
		connections.  MANY MANY thanks to BSDI for releasing
		the original code, and to Ted Lemon <mellon@NetBSD.org>
		for doing the initial integration work!	 [thorpej 19970723]

	bus_space(9): Added manpage which describes the kernel's bus_space_*()
		functions.  [cgd 19970813]
	Implemented `force password change at next login', by setting

		which only accepts ioctl() and can be opened at any time.
		[augustss 19970818]
	ftp(1): support for gate-ftp (TIS fwtk ftp-gate), don't treat
		"-" and "|..." as special local filenames during mget
		and get if not specified explicitly.  [lukem 19970819]
	audio: Make the audio device attach to the hardware audio drivers
		in the normal way (not the special magic that was used
		before).  The requires an extra line in the config file
		to get the sound to work again.	 [augustss 19970820]
	audio: Minor change in audio_hw_if (again).  Improve error
		handling in the audio driver.  Add the AUDIO_PROP_INDEPENDENT
		property.  Add new audio(9) man page. [augustss 19970825]

	ethernet: Update the "fxp" driver to FreeBSD-current-970823.  Convert
		driver to use if_media.  [thorpej 19970825]
	isa: XXX Add a drq2 locator for the ISA bus.  Many sound cards need
		two DMA channels to do e.g. full-duplex.  This allows
		a way of specifying the second channel in a sane way.
		THIS IS TEMPORARY.  The drq2 locator will go away when
		the locator system has been changed to allow multiple

		- get entries for a whole week in advance, or only one day.
		[thorpej 19970826]
	scsipi: Added a new bus interface machinery sys/dev/scsipi, for use
		with SCSI and ATAPI devices (derived from sys/scsi). Split

	netinet,net: add IP fast forwarding (flow-based) routing.  The code
		will bypass the normal IP processing path and directly forward
		from a device receive interrupt (via ether_input or
		fddi_input for now).  [matt 19980429]
	net/bpf: add support for two new ioctls, BIOC[GS]HDRCMPLT to
		get/set the "header already complete" flag.  This allows
		BPF writers to spoof layer 2 source addresses (if the
		layer 2 supports it) in applications where it is necessary.
		Submitted by Greg Smith <greg@nas.nasa.gov>. [thorpej 19980429]
	Changed vslock() and vsunlock() to take a proc *, rather than
		implicitly operating on curproc.  [thorpej 19980429]
	arm32: Overhauled page table management separating the page tables
		from the processes vm_map. [mark 19980430]
	netinet: make TCP_COMPAT_42, TCP_CWM, and the CWM burst size
		configurable via sysctl. [thorpej 19980430]
	inetd(8): Add support for specifying send and receive socket buffer
		sizes to inetd. This will allow larger windows to be advertised
		for TCP servers, improving TCP performance in some
		situations.  [thorpej 19980430]
	audio: Add Ensoniq AudioPCI sound card driver.	[augustss 19980501]

		[veego 19980501]
	pppd(8): Upgraded to 2.3.4 [christos 19980502]
	alpha, hp300, mac68k, mvme68k: switch to UVM+PMAP_NEW on the alpha, and

	mac68k: Add kgdb support.  [scottr 19980505]
	net: Add monotonically increasing "current time" timestamps for the
		protocol fast and slow timeouts.  Convert the TCP timers
		to use these timestamps, shaving some instructions
		(quite a few, actually, on the Alpha) from the inner
		loop of tcp_slowtimo().	 [thorpej 19980505]
	macppc: initial import of macppc port.	[tsubai 19980515]

		framework.  [matt 19980521]
	pmax, bus_dma(9): Completely rewrite bus_space back-end and write a
		first-cut bus_dma back-end for the DECstation. 
		[thorpej 19980522]
	toolchain: Changed most toolchain bits present in GNU binutils

		powerdown fails, or the system does not support software
		powerdown, the system will simply halt.  [thorpej 19980606]
	alpha: add support for software powerdown on the Digital Personal
		Workstation (Miata).  [thorpej 19980606]
	sparc: add support for software powerdown on Sun4m systems
		which have that capability.  [thorpej 19980606]
	i386: Systems w/ APM will no longer powerdown automatically on
		halt; an explicit RB_POWERDOWN (halt or shutdown -p)
		is now required.  [thorpej 19980606]
	alpha: Implement bus_space_{alloc,free}() for BWX mem and i/o
		and swiz i/o space.  PCMCIA now works on Alpha.
		[thorpej 19980606]
	i386: add optional strict alignment checking to the bus_space
		implementation.	 [thorpej 19980606]
	isapnp: Add ISAPnP attachment for PCMCIA [sommerfeld 19980607]

	sun3: Add UVM support (sun3x still to come) [gwr 19980608]
	isa: Change the ISA DMA API to take an isa_chipset_tag_t rather
		than a struct device * corresponding to the ISA bus device.
		The ISA DMA controller driver functions have been renamed
		and now take a struct isa_dma_state *, and are called
		indirectly by machine-dependent code which provides the
		DMA state.  These changes allow e.g. `ofisa' (the
		OpenFirmware configuration mechanism for the ISA bus, used
		by e.g. Sharks) to use the MI ISA DMA controller code.
		[thorpej 19980608]
	kernel: Implement config_defer(), a generic mechanism to defer the
		configuration of a device until all of its siblings
		have been attached.  Make the PCI-ISA bridge code use
		this mechanism, rather than its own.  [thorpej 19980609]
	next68k: initial import of next68k port. [dbj 19980609]
	scsipi: Add a shutdown hook for SCSI-2 and higher disks that issue
		a SYNCHRONIZE CACHE operation, to ensure that data
		is on the platter if we're doing a powerdown.
		[thorpej 19980610]
	Change kernel includes to be installed directory-by-directory,
		which provides added flexibility in terms of what
		is to be installed, and which makes incremental installs
		a bit easier.  Existing behaviour (symlinks vs. copies,
		etc.) is preserved, except for bug fixes.  A new
		mk template, bsd.kinc.mk, exists to help support these
		changes and factor out common bits.  [cgd 19980612]
	sparc64: Initial import of sparc64 port [eeh 19980620]
	alpha: Added support for three new server platforms, Noritake,
		Pintake, and Corelle. [ross 19980623]
	NFS: move the lease check into genfs, and make its null-op'ness
		a compile-time decision for the kernel, not for file
		system modules.	 Allows loaded file systems to export,
		which did not previously work correctly.  [thorpej 19980625]
	alpha: Add first-draft support for the Tadpole/DEC AlphaBook,
		which is basically an AXPpci33 in laptop's clothing.
		[thorpej 19980625]
	pci: added 'puc' driver for "PCI 'universal' communications' cards
		containing 'com' and 'lpt' ports.  [cgd 19980626]
	alpha: take a stab at EB66 support.  An EB66 is basically an
		EB64+ with a 21066 LCA instead of a 21064 + APECS.
		[thorpej 19980627]
	Add mechanism for programs to dump core into either "core" or
		"progname.core", based on an adjustable system-wide
		setting. [nathanw 19980628]
	sun3: make the boot programs look for netbsd.$arch before
		"netbsd" so boot media can support both sun3/sun3x
		by including a kernel for each.	 [gwr 19980629]
	pread(2), pwrite(2): Add pread(2) and pwrite(2) system calls
		(per XPG4.2) and preadv(2) and pwritev(2), which are NetBSD
		extensions (positional cousins to readv(2) and writev(2)).
		[thorpej 19980630]
	xsrc:	Major code sweep: modified 57 files to clean up 98% of
		all the LP64-related warnings. This killed a few real bugs
		and a lot of compiler false alarms. [ross 19980706]
	alpha:	Enabled the IDE controller on the AXPPCI33. IDE and
		ATAPI CDROM drives should now work. [ross 19980707]
	vm,uvm: Add support for mmap'ing disk block devices. [thorpej 19980707]
	uvm: add support for multiple page free lists.	[thorpej 19980707]
	arm32, bus_dma(9): implement a bus_dma back-end for the Shark.
		[thorpej 19980707]
	ftp(1): add "sndbuf" and "rcvbuf" commands, for setting socket buffer
		sizes, allowing use of large TCP windows.  Work in progress,
		no support for setting system and per-user defaults, yet.
		[thorpej 19980709]
	ipfilter: updated to 3.2.9 [veego 19980712]
	amiga:	Added UVM support [mhitch 19980712]

		but it should be easy to add to other PCI platforms as well.
		See usb(4) for an overview.
		[augustss 19980712]
	atapi: Add support for ATAPI changer devices like the NEC CDR-251.
		Userland support in /bin/chio. [hpeyerl,thorpej 19980713]
	identd(8): Upgraded pidentd to version 2.8.3 [msaitoh 19980715]

	ftp(1): support HTTP 301 and 302 redirects, and speed up transfer
		completion in HTTP/1.1 downloads (by disabling persistent
		connections).  [lukem 19980723]
	arm32: Break up the Shark CS8900 driver into core, ISA, and OfISA
		parts, and make it machine-independent.  [thorpej 19980724]
	usb: change mouse and keyboard drivers so that they use wscons.
		Also add the wsmouse protocol to XFree86.  [augustss 19980727]
	kernel: update of memory resource pool: configurable back-end
		storage provider; cache coloring and dynamic sizing
		after Bonwick's "slabs". [pk 19980727]
	Change uio_resid to a size_t, and change the residual argument of
		vn_rdwr() from int * to size_t * to match.  No behavioral
		difference, except for Alpha, which can now use full
		SSIZE_MAX sized transfers (i.e. signed 64-bit length).
		Sweep inspired by a discussion of a bug introduced in
		OpenBSD on Bugtraq.  [thorpej 19980728]
	libedit: add 'edit on|off' editrc command, which is used to advise
		invoking programs if a user's does or doesn't want editline
		support. Modify ftp(1) to honour this.	[lukem 19980729]
	tftpd(8): add support for -u user and -g group, which specify the user

	x68k: switch to MI zs driver [minoura 19980805]
	ifmedia: Completely rewrite the way media descriptions are
		represented.  The same data structure is used, but a much
		saner matching mechanism is used, one which allows greater
		ease in adding new types.  Also, change the format of
		ifconfig's status report to make it more attractive
		in the presense of many media types. [thorpej 19980805]
	NFS: Add client pathconf support.  [kleink 19980807]
	amd(8): upgraded to 6.0a16 [christos 19980808]

		instead of bcopy, ovbcopy, bzero and bcmp. [perry 19980809]
	vax: Support for VS4000/60 CPU, serial console and ethernet.
		This is first VMS-only vax supported.  [ragge 19980810]
	MII: near rewrite of MII layer, now exports a software interface
		like BSDI's.  Add PHY drivers for Intel i82555 and

		the MII/PHY on the 3c905 boards.  Fixes PR kern/4782.
		[thorpej 19980812]
	kernel: Removed vm_offset_t and vm_size_t and replaced them with
		vaddr_t and vsize_t for virtual addresses and
		paddr_t and psize_t for physical addresses.  This allows

	mac68k: Rewrite console framebuffer initialization and autoconfig.
		[scottr 19980812]

	egcs: Imported egcs 1.1 snapshot 19980816.  [tv 19980816]
	audio: Add support for MIDI device drivers and device independent
		access to them.	 The raw MIDI devices can be accessed
		through /dev/rmidiN. /dev/music presents a sequencer
		interface.  The API has been modelled after the OSS API.
		There is also a syntheziser layer that helps emulate a MIDI
		device.	 This layer is used by the Yamaha OPL[23] driver
		and the PC speaker driver.  [augustss 19980818]
	vax: Increase logical pagesize to 4K. [ragge 19980821]
	atari: Added a driver for the Circad Leonardo video card from

		commands (FEAT & OPTS). other cleanups.	 [lukem 19980907]
	kernel: Implement a new kernel thread, the process "reaper", which
		cleans up VM resources (vmspace and u-area).  Machine-dependent
		code now calls exit2() to schedule the reaper to run
		once we are no longer running on the dead proc's
		vmspace and stack.  A valid thread must do this work
		since it may block in a multiprocessor environment.
		Original idea from Charles Hannum.  [thorpej 19980908]
	gre: Implement a gre pseudo network interface that allows to tunnel
		L3 protocols over IP. Currently only IP/IP and IP/GRE
		supported. [hwr 19980913]

		capability, and a possibly (it's not really for us to say)
		patent-free implementation. [ross 19980913]
	egcs: Imported egcs 1.1b release. [tv 19980913]
	alpha: add some support for multiple processors to the pmap
		module.	 Still needs TLB shootdown code, but that is
		easier once the code to spin up the additional CPUs
		is working.  [thorpej 19980921]
	i386: add support for AdvanSys Ultra Wide boards.
		At this time the following PCI boards are supported:
		- ABP-9xx
		- ABP-9xxU

	vnode system: Modified vnode_if.src syntax to indicate if a VOP
		unlocks the vnode in addition to vrele'ing.
		Reduced the maximum number of vnodes passed to a
		VOP from 16 to 8 (most we actually pass is 4).
		Added genfs_eopnotsupp_rele(), a generic VOP error
		function.  It will unlock and rele all vnodes passed
		into the function, using the new vnode_if.src
		syntax. [wrstuden 19990707]
	vnode locking: Modified struct vnode to include a struct lock,
		and add genfs_lock(), genfs_unlock(), and
		genfs_islocked() operations. All leaf fs's other
		than nfs now use lock manager locks to protect
		internal data, including kernfs, fdescfs, portalfs,
		and procfs. Leaf fs's now store the address of their struct
		lock in v_vnlock. A value of NULL indicates that the fs
		does not use the lock manager. Layered fs's directly lock
		and unlock the struct lock referenced in v_vnlock, if non-
		null. nfs exports a NULL as it does no locking at present,
		and unionfs exports a NULL as its locking is more complex
		than locking a single struct lock. [wrstuden 19990707]
	layered filesystems: Added layerfs routines in sys/miscfs/genfs
		which provide almost all of the functionality of nullfs.
		The latter is now just a mount & unmount routine, and
		initialization tables. umapfs uses many of the layerfs
		routines also. Both filesystems are now (nfs) exportable.
		Layered filesystems will directly access the struct lock
		pointed to by v_vnlock if available, using VOP_LOCK on the
		underlying fs if v_vnlock is NULL. [wrstuden 19990707]
	newsmips: Add native boot loader.  [tsubai 19990708]
	ktruss(1): add in a new interface to the ktrace subsystem.  ktruss(1)
		uses fktrace(2) to acquire ktrace records as soon as they are
		generated by the kernel, decoding and printing them into a
		more compact format similar to that of truss/trace/strace.
		Standard ktrace.out files may also be used as input.  No more
		is ktrace/kdump required to monitor a running program.  The
		man page for ktrace(1) has been updated to also include usage
		of ktruss(1). [darrenr 19990712]

		routines from libm/arch/mc68881 on 68060, and 68040-effective
		on 68040 (for the others, the generic C code). This is 
		currently switched at compile time by adding M68060=1 or
		M68040=1 to /etc/mk.conf.
		More work needs to be done to actually create all three 
		versions in binary packages, so that they can be chosen
		at installation time or even later. (If we switch to ELF,
		the init function can patch the jump table at run time.)

		binaries to what PROG_PAX is set. [christos 20061110]
	lfs_cleanerd(8): Move from /usr/libexec to /libexec so that the
		root file system can be safely placed on a LFS volume.
		[jmmv 20061110]
	tmpfs: Drop experimental status and enable it by default in the
		GENERIC kernels of amd64, i386, macppc and sparc64.
		[jmmv 20061110]

		contributed by Mihai Chelaru. [xtraeme 20070106]
	i386, amd64: remove option COMPAT_386BSD_MBRPART from default
		kernels.  NetBSD has not used partition ID 0x165 for many,
		many years, and the presence of this option in INSTALL
		kernels can cause overwriting of existing FreeBSD
		installations when sysinst writes back the disklabel.
		Those with very, very old NetBSD installations may find
		that they must update their fdisk partition tables to use
		partition ID 0x169 for their NetBSD partitions. [tls 20070124]
