DONE
----
1. Removed linking of the kernel compat object library into all kernels;
   using the .o library caused some build breakage, and resulted in the
   bulk of the compat code being included in every kernel, but without
   any module linkage.  In turn, this caused failure when loading some
   modules due to symbols already being defined in the kernel.

2. Reverted some intentional breakage for loading the sysv_ipc module;
   the breakage was introduced as the fix for the above-mentioned build
   breakage.  

3. Split the sysv_ipc compat routines into their own compat_sysv module.

4. Resolved some inter-module dependencies.

5. Extracted some net/if.c compat routines into the compat module, and
   replaced the originals with indirect (vectored) function calls.

6. Implemented a mechanism for modules to include "aliases", allowing
   a single module file to declare multiple names.  For example, a
   single "compat" module could declare compat_80, compat_70, etc, and
   other modules could depend on specific compat levels rather than on
   the entirety of compat.

7. Reconfirmed existing compat-module dependencies, and update the
   defopt/defflag lines in the config files* as needed, to insure that
   built-in dependencies get resolved.


TODO
----
1. Audit the entire code base for any remaining embedded #ifdef's for
   COMPAT_xx.  When found, move the actual compat code into the compat
   hierarchy and replace originals with indirect (vectored) calls.

2. Using the alias mechanism, split compat (and perhaps compat_sysv)
   into multiple version-specific modules.  Note that in addition to
   updating the module code, this would also require changes to
   syscalls.master files to change the names of the modules associated
   with module-provided syscalls.

   Update:  These are being done simultaneously, with compat code being
   moved directly to a version-specific module.  All of COMPAT_80 and
   COMPAT_70, most of COMPAT_60, and much of COMPAT_50 are finished.
   Need to decide how to handle the COMPAT_BSDPTY stuff.

3. XXX The compat_60 module still needs some work for XEN systems.

4. Update syscalls.master to point the compat calls at the specific
   modules rather than the monolithic compat module.  Update the
   "required" lists of other modules, too.
