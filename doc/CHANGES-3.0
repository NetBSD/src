#	$NetBSD: CHANGES-3.0,v 1.1.2.338 2005/12/16 11:42:34 tron Exp $

A complete list of changes from the initial NetBSD 3.0 branch on 16 March 2005
until the 3.0 release:

doc/LAST_MINUTE					patched by hand

	Null out in preparation for 3.0

gnu/usr.bin/groff/tmac/mdoc.local		patched by hand
sys/sys/param.h					patched by hand

	Update to 3.0_BETA

doc/BRANCHES					1.37

	Close out 1.5 and note differences between netbsd-2 and netbsd-2-0
	branches.
	[jmc, ticket #7]

usr.sbin/pkg_install/lib/ftpio.c		1.67

	Address PR pkg/24744 by Jarmo Jaakkola <jarmo.jaakkola@iki.fi>:
	  * ftp.fi.netbsd.org returns "257" in return to a "cd" command, accept
	    that (in addition to 250 and 550). Seems to be allowed per RFC 959.
	  * Make buffer for reply bigger (not too big, as it may hit
	    performance).
	[hubertf, ticket #8]

usr.sbin/pkg_install/lib/version.h		1.65

	Bump PKGTOOLS_VERSION to today's date to allow telling in which version
	PR 24744 was fixed (affects lib/ftpio.c).
	[hubertf, ticket #9]

sbin/mount/mount.c				1.77

	Fix core dump when doing
		mount fileserver:/somepath
	by not passing a NULL pointer to getfsfile(3).
	(Bug was introduced in rev 1.74 as part of fix for PR 28644.)
	[lukem, ticket #10]

sbin/sysctl/sysctl.c				1.98

	Use regexes instead of static lists of annoying numbers to recognize
	sysctl nodes that have "helpers". This is more concise, imho more
	easy to understand, and has the added bonus of making it *possible* to
	assign helpers to dynamically numbered nodes.
	[atatat, ticket #11]

sys/sys/select.h				1.23

	Make sure to declare functions with C linkage; should fix PR bin/29730
	from Juergen Hannken-Illjes.
	[kleink, ticket #14]

doc/3DPARTY					1.305

	Update XFree86 Information.
	[tron, ticket #12]

xsrc/Makefile					1.44

	Remove code handling "contrib" directory.
	[tron, ticket #13]

etc/pam.d/sshd					1.6-1.7

	Make the SSH daemon work again if PAM is enabled.
	[jwise, ticket #19]

etc/pam.d/xserver				1.3

	pam_self is "required" not just sufficient to authorize the Xserver.
	[jwise, ticket #20]

lib/libpam/modules/pam_unix/pam_unix.c		1.6

	Clear the authorization token at the entry of each loop, so that
	we get a chance to re-enter.
	[christos, ticket #22]

lib/libpam/modules/pam_ssh/pam_ssh.c		1.9

	Remove debugging printf's.
	[christos, ticket #23]

libexec/getty/main.c				1.47

	Print ptyfs ptys properly.
	[christos, ticket #24]

libexec/telnetd/utility.c			1.28

	Handle printing ptyfs pty names.
	[christos, ticket #25]

sys/dev/cgd_crypto.c				1.4

	[dan, ticket #26]

distrib/sets/lists/base/shl.mi			1.305
lib/libc/shlib_version				1.162
lib/libc/sys/Makefile.inc			1.157
lib/libpthread/pthread_cancelstub.c		1.11
lib/libpthread/shlib_version			1.8

	Interpose cancellation points in pollts() and pselect(), bringing us
	to libc.so.12.127 and libpthread.so.0.6.
	[kleink, ticket #27]

sys/arch/xen/i386/hypervisor_machdep.c		1.5

	Avoid loosing upcalls in stipending() by checking evtchn_upcall_pending
	with upcalls unmasked.
	[bouyer, ticket #29]

sys/arch/xen/i386/vector.S			1.7

	When handling a defered event, unmasking it isn't enouth, we also need
	to check if the corresponding bit needs to be set in
	evtchn_pending_sel, and eventually force an upcall (if we got a second
	event when this one what being handled). For now to this by calling
	hypervisor_enable_irq(), this could be rewritten in inline assembly by
	someone knowing enouth about i386 assembly :)
	[bouyer, ticket #30]

sys/arch/xen/xen/ctrl_if.c			1.3

	Print the IRQ used by the domain controller.
	[bouyer, ticket #31]

sys/arch/xen/xen/evtchn.c			1.4

	Protect various IRQ and event allocation/deallocations with splhigh().
	Print the IRQ used for debug and misdirect events.
	[bouyer, ticket #32]

	Add PCI audio devices from i386/conf/GENERIC.
	[bouyer, ticket #34]

sys/arch/xen/i386/npx.c				1.4

	npxintr(): this function does the right thing if we don't try to clear
	the interrupt latch (which is probably done by the hypervisor,
	linux/xen doesn't do it either). Now the "fputest" configure test from
	pkgsrc/math/yorick works as expected.
	[bouyer, ticket #35]

sbin/sysctl/sysctl.c				1.99

	Fix possible segmentation fault when retrieving descriptions.
	[atatat, ticket #36]

sys/arch/prep/conf/INSTALL			1.33

	Add PLATFORM_IBM_6015 to INSTALL, as present in GENERIC.
	[kleink, ticket #37]

	to do it.
	[kleink, ticket #38]

	[kleink, ticket #41]

lib/librt/sem_getvalue.3			1.2

	Add restrict qualifiers to function arguments (already in
	<semaphore.h>).
	[kleink, ticket #42]

lib/libpam/modules/pam_skey/pam_skey.c		1.2

	Make S/Key prompt compliant with RFC 2289. Patch supplied by Dave Huang
	in PR bin/23167.

	[kleink, ticket #46]

sys/arch/xen/xen/if_xennet.c			1.15

	In xennet_ioctl, we need a declaration for sc when debugging macros are
	active.  Reported on current-users by Teemu Rinta-aho.

	[atatat, ticket #52]

usr.sbin/pppd/pppd/Makefile			1.37

	If SMALLPROG is set, do not build in PAM support. While there, depend

	instead of waiting forever.
	[christos, ticket #64]

doc/README.files				patch

	Update for 3.0 branch

lib/libc/citrus/citrus_none.c			1.13

	getting on SMP systems.
	[bouyer, ticket #71]

sys/arch/xen/i386/gdt.c				1.4

	Merge 1.1.14.3 from yamt-km branch:

sys/arch/alpha/pci/pci_kn300.c			1.27
sys/arch/alpha/pci/sio_pic.c			1.33

	- Add a alpha_shared_intr_reset_strays() function that resets the  
	  stray interrupt counter for a given shared interrupt descriptor.
	- When an interrupt is successfully handled, reset the strays counter,
	  thus preventing a "slow leak" from eventually shutting off the  
	  interrupt vector. Idea taken from pci_kn300.c (which was changed
	  to use the new alpha_shared_intr_reset_strays() function).
	[thorpej, ticket #76]

usr.bin/login/login.c				1.84

	Add a colon before %m in calls to syslog(3) for consistency with other
	messages in this same file and in many other tools.
	[jmmv, ticket #77]

lib/libc/db/hash/hash.c				1.21

	Don't refuse to create a hash database on 0 length files. Treat
	them as new files the same way that the btree code does.  Note that
	we do the fstat() after the open() instead of re-using the previous
	result of the stat() to avoid races (we open with O_EXLOCK when we
	care).
	[christos, ticket #78]

sys/net/if_gre.c				1.56
sys/netinet/ip_gre.c				1.34

	Add missing flags to usage().
	[xtraeme, ticket #81]

	Fixes PR 29651.
	[chs, ticket #82]

sys/sys/fcntl.h					1.32

	Correct the comment against FKIOCTL and put the comment against FMASK
	back where it belongs.
	[skrll, ticket #83]

sys/dev/vnd.c					1.112,1.114
sys/dev/vndvar.h				1.14

	Make vnd do I/O to the underlying file from thread context. This
	allows the strategy routine to be called from interrupt context,
	fixes PR kern/29775 by Juan RP.
	Now that pool_get() is only called from thread context, change
	PR_NOWAIT to PR_WAITOK. Fix PR kern/26272 by Juergen Hannken-Illjes.
	Don't eventually leak vnx and bp on unconfigure, pointed out by
	YAMAMOTO Takashi. Instead, let the current I/O complete before
	killing the thread.
	[bouyer, ticket #85]

etc/MAKEDEV.tmpl				1.41

	Add pf to the all target.
	[peter, ticket #86]

	[yamt, ticket #88]

sys/nfs/nfs_socket.c				1.113
sys/netinet/tcp_output.c			1.129

	nfsrv_rcv: don't do so_receive from socket upcall context.
	While there's little benefits, it complicates locking and confuses
	flow control.
	tcp_output: lock reass queue when building sack.

sys/dev/ic/rtl81x9reg.h				1.12
sys/dev/ic/rtl81x9var.h				1.18

	- restructure tx descriptor handling code to decouple
	  number of tx descriptors, number of rx descriptors, and number of
	  mbufs.
	- bump number of tx descriptors for rtl8169. 64 doesn't seem to be
	  sufficient when doing TSO.
	[yamt, ticket #91]

sys/dev/ic/rtl8169.c				1.16

	re_encap: set RTK_TDESC_CMD_IPCSUM if any of checksum offloading is
	requested. Otherwise, RTK_TDESC_CMD_TCPCSUM/UDPCSUM don't seem to
	make any effect.
	[yamt, ticket #92]

sys/arch/xen/i386/gdt.c				1.3

	Don't bother to allocate gdt slots for tss as we don't actually
	use them.
	[yamt, ticket #93]

sys/dev/ic/rtl8169.c				1.17

	- use IFQ_POLL/DEQUEUE rather than IF_DEQUEUE/PREPEND.

	Push back the descriptions of NaN formats, and descriptions of the
	distinction between signalling NaNs and quiet NaNs back into the
	machine-dependent headers; treat the implementation of __nanf in the
	same spirit.
	IEEE 754 leaves the distinction between signalling NaNs and quiet NANs
	to the implementation, and unlike our headers used to suggest they're
	not identical in the interpretation of the fraction's MSb; in due
	course, make those of hppa, mips, sh3, and sh5 reflect reality.
	Due to their "inverse" treatment of the fraction's MSb, update NAN
	conversion to construct a quiet NaN on hppa, mips, sh3, and sh5 as
	well. Also, remove the portion constructing a ROP on vax; this is not
	required by the standard, and in its consequences it is not an
	appropriate substitute for a qNaN.

	Implement a timeout on the accept(2) in dataconn() and the
	connect(2) in xconnect() by temporarily setting O_NONBLOCK
	on the socket and using xpoll() to wait for the operation
	to succeed.
	The timeout used is the '-q quittime' argument (defaults to
	60s for accept(2), and the system default for connect(2)).
	Idea inspired by discussion with Chuck Cranor.
	This may (indirectly) fix various problems with timeouts
	in active mode through broken firewalls.
	Implement xpoll() as a wrapper around poll(2), to make it
	easier to replace on systems without a functional poll(2).
	Unconditionally use xpoll() instead of conditionally using

	net_i == BYADDR.
	[lukem, ticket #392]

lib/libc/gen/nlist_elf32.c			1.27

	Work according to veriexec strict level, not securelevel. Also, use the
	veriexec_report() routine when possible; and when opening a file for
	writing, only invalidate the fingerprint - not always the data will be
	changed.
	[elad, ticket #447]

usr.sbin/pkg_install/add/perform.c		1.108-1.109

	Fix a minor bug in the estimation of required disk space.  In
	particular make sure we use a data type which is big enough.
	This fixes a problem where pkg_add-ing of a binary package
	which is between 512 Mb and 1 Gb fails because the estimated
	required disk space is negative due to overflowing in the
	calculation.
	[dm, ticket #444]

	that are not exact matches, but satisfy requirements.
	Bump version to 20050529.
	[wiz, ticket #452]

usr.sbin/pkg_install/delete/perform.c		1.56

sys/kern/subr_pool.c				1.101

	Fix some locking issues:
	- Make the locking rules for pr_rmpage() sane, and don't modify fields
	  protected by the pool lock without actually holding it.
	- Always defer freeing the pool page to the back-end allocator, to
	  avoid invoking the pool_allocator with the pool locked (which would
	  violate the pool_allocator -> pool locking order).
	- Fix pool_reclaim() to not violate the pool_cache -> pool locking
	  order by using a trylock.

	drive have its electronic ready to properly respond to the register

sys/arch/alpha/alpha/pmap.c			1.211

	1. Disable the lazy allocation of lev1map in pmap_enter(), instead
	   doing it in pmap_create(), and freeing the lev1map in
	   pmap_destroy(). This means that pm_lev1map is consistent for the
	   life of the pmap.
	2. pmap_extract() now uses vtophys() for the kernel pmap. This avoids
	   having to lock the kernel pmap, since kernel PT pages are never
	   freed.
	3. Because of (1), pmap_asn_alloc() no longer needs to operate on a
	   locked pmap; pm_lev1map will never change over the life of the pmap,
	   and all other access to the pmap is done in per-CPU fields or with
	   atomic operations.
	4. Because of (3), pmap_activate() no longer needs to lock the pmap
	   to do its work, thus eliminating the deadlock with sched_lock
	   described in PR port-alpha/25599.  This is safe because we are
	   guaranteed that the pmap is still alive, since by definition an LWP
	   that uses that it is about to run.

	[elad, ticket #668]

sys/dev/verified_exec.c				1.21
sys/kern/kern_verifiedexec.c			1.35

	The veriexec API uses dev_t and ino_t for device and inode numbers.
	VOP_GETATTR() fills a struct vattr, where va_fsid and va_fileid (device
	and inode..) are typed as long.
	Add some casts when using these values and surround them with XXXs
	about the potential size mismatch, as long can be 64 bits but dev_t
	and ino_t are always 32 bits. This is safe because *for now* we're
	still using 32 bit inode numbers.

sys/dev/ic/wdc.c				1.226,1.229

	The ATA/ATAPI IDENTIFY data were designed to be converted on the fly to
	host byte order (eventually the byte swapping could be wired in
	hardware, on the 16 bit data bus). This was keept when
	wdc_exec_command() was created, and as a result wdc_exec_command() is
	doing 16bit conversion to host byte order. This is fine for IDENTIFY
	but doesn't work for other opaque data structure, such as the ones
	for SMART. So change wdc_exec_command() to do the conversion to host
	byte order only for WDCC_IDENTIFY and ATAPI_IDENTIFY_DEVICE. This fixes
	atactl smart status on big-endian hosts.

	[gavan, ticket #752]

sys/kern/uipc_syscalls.c			1.91-1.94

	Close additional file descriptors if we set MSG_CTRUNC in a SCM_RIGHTS
	message. This fixes PR kern/30370.
	In adjust_rights() Use CMSG_SPACE() to calculate the number of
	filedescriptors passed in this message - the counterpart in
	unp_externalize does this as well.
	Note that CMSG_SPACE(0) does not make sense, since it does not invoke
	the alignment magic - so use CMSG_SPACE(sizeof(int)) and adjust the
	calculated total later.
	This fixes the postfix conection cache for 64bit platforms. Previously
	the number of passed filed descriptors (nfds) would have been
	calculeted too high, causing the fdrelease() of uninitialized junk.

sys/uvm/uvm_glue.c				1.90

	Remove the assertion in uvm_swapout_threads() about LSONPROC lwps
	not running on the same CPU as the swapper.  l_stat is protected by
	sched_lock, which isn't held here, so we can race with that lwp
	starting to run and see its l_cpu not updated yet, as in PR 31870.
	we check l_stat again in uvm_swapout() while holding sched_lock,
	so the race itself is harmless.

sys/kern/kern_sa.c				1.68

	In sa_switch(), if after we set up the LWP with cpu_setfunc(), we

	clear the sau from the LWP's arg.  sa_switch() frees the sau in this 
	case, but if we don't reset the LWP's state and the process exits, 
	then the exiting LWP will try to free the sau again.

	In pthread_mutex_lock_slow(), pthread_rwlock_timedrdlock() and 
	sem_wait(), call pthread__start() if it hasn't already been called. 
	This avoids an internal assertion from the library if these routines 
	are used before any threads are created and they need to sleep. 
	PR#20256, PR#24241, PR#25722, PR#26096
	
	Fix the interaction between sigtimedwait() and pthread_kill(),
	both waking up a sleeping thread and avoiding going to sleep if
	a signal is already pending. PR#30348
	
	In pthread_kill() and pthread_suspend_np(), return without doing 
	anything f the target thread is a zombie.
	In all the functions that didn't do so already, verify a pthread_t 
	before dereferencing it (under #ifdef ERRORCHECK, since these checks 
	are not mandated by the standard).
	
	Starting the pthread library (ie. calling pthread__start()) before
	any threads are created turned out to be not such a good idea.    
	there are stronger requirements on what has to work in a forked child
	while a process is still single-threaded.  so take all that stuff    
	back out and fix the problems with single-threaded programs that     
	are linked with libpthread differently, by checking if the library   
	has been started and doing completely different stuff if it hasn't been:
	 - for pthread_rwlock_timedrdlock(), just fail with EDEADLK immediately.
	 - for sem_wait(), the only thing that can unlock the semaphore is a    
	   signal handler, so use sigsuspend() to wait for a signal.
	 - for pthread_mutex_lock_slow(), just go into an infinite loop
	   waiting for signals.
	
	If mlock() fails in pthread_create(), return EAGAIN instead of
	failing an assertion.

	Reduce the use of the system() function in pkg_install to avoid quoting
	problems.  Instead, use exec*() functions.  Replace PUSHOUT()
	macro and string buffers with a function that operates on data
	structures.  If it is necessary to copy files into place from
	staging area, then use pax to copy them.
	Add functions in pexec.c to create a pipe for sending data to a child
	process.  Replace pipe code in create/perform.c with these functions.
	Use these functions instead of command-line arguments when copying files
	into place from staging area.
	Three system() references remain: @exec, @unexec, and vsystem().

distrib/common/buildfloppies.sh			1.11-1.12

	Report the exact number of free bytes in the install floppy images.
	The 'padded by' number displayed for multi-floppy images has been
	out by 8k per floppy for a while.  (The rest of the sums are ok).
	Change the 'padded' size to include all the space in the last 8k block
	of the tar file.
	Similarly if the image doesn't fit, report the exact amount of overflow.
	[dsl, ticket #1005]

gnu/dist/gcc/gcc/config/i386/i386.c		1.5

	When compiling with -Os put all strings into .rodata.str1.1 (ie
	byte aligned) rather than putting those longer than 30 chars into
	.rodata.str1.32.  Apparantly gcc 3.4.4 has this change...
	In spite of everything being compressed, this saves over 13k in the
	boot floppies.
	[dsl, ticket #1006]

usr.sbin/rpc.statd/statd.c			1.25

	We can't call db->put() with key or data pointing back to db(3)'s memory
	space, or the database will be corrupted (noticed when the database is
	updated in reset_host()). Change change_host() to copy hostname and
	HostInfo to local storage before calling db->put().
	Change notify_one() to use change_host() instead of calling db->put()
	directly.
