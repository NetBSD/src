A complete list of changes from the NetBSD 7.0 release to the NetBSD 7.0.1
release:

gnu/usr.bin/groff/tmac/mdoc.local		patched by hand
sys/sys/param.h					patched by hand

	Welcome to 7.0.0_PATCH.
	[snj]

distrib/amd64/ramdisks/common/Makefile.ramdisk	1.11
distrib/amd64/ramdisks/common/list.ramdisk	1.20
distrib/i386/ramdisks/common/Makefile.ramdisk	1.12
distrib/i386/ramdisks/common/list.ramdisk	1.26

	PR install/50311: missing gptmbr.bin on ramdisk based installs.
	[martin, ticket #992]

sys/dev/cgd.c					1.97

	Use explicit_memset to zero key material.
	[riastradh, ticket #899]

sys/dev/mii/atphy.c				1.17

	Fix incorrect argument of mii_anar(). Fixes PR#50206.
	[msaitoh, ticket #971]

sys/kern/kern_exec.c				1.419, 1.420
sys/kern/kern_exit.c				1.246, 1.247
sys/kern/kern_synch.c				1.309

	In execve_runproc(), update the p_waited entry for the process
	being moved to SSTOP state, not for its parent.  If the value is
	not already zero, it could prevent its parent from waiting for
	the process.  Fixes PR kern/50298
	--
	When clearing out the scheduler queues during system shutdown,
	we move all processes to the SSTOP state.  Make sure we update
	each process's p_waited and the parents' p_nstopchild counters
	to maintain consistent values.  Fixes PR kern/50318
	--
	Currently, if a process is exiting and its parent has indicated
	no intent of reaping the process (nor any other children), the
	process will get reparented to init.  Since the state of the
	exiting process at this point is SDEAD, proc_reparent() will not
	update either the old or new parent's p_nstopchild counters.
	This change causes both old and new parents to be properly
	updated.  Fixes PR kern/50300
	--
	For processes marked with PS_STOPEXIT, update the process's
	p_waited value, and update its parent's p_nstopchild value when
	marking the process's p_stat to SSTOP.  The process needed to be
	SACTIVE to get here, so this transition represents an additional
	process for which the parent needs to wait.  Fixes PR kern/50308
	--
	In spawn_return() we temporarily move the process state to SSTOP,
	but without updating its p_waited value or its parent's
	p_nstopchild counter.  Later, we restore the original state,
	again without any adjustment of the related values.  This leaves
	a relatively short window when the values are inconsistent and
	could interfere with the proper operation of sys_wait() for the
	parent.  If during this window, any of the checks being made
	result in an error, we call exit1() which will eventually migrate
	the process's state to SDEAD (with an intermediate transition to
	SDYING).  At this point the other variables get updated, and we
	finally restore a consistent state.
	This change updates the p_waited and parent's p_nstopchild at each
	step to eliminate any windows during which the values could lead
	to incorrect decisions.  Fixes PR kern/50330
	[pgoyette, ticket #996]

sys/kern/kern_sig.c				1.321

	When delivering a signal, it's possible that the process's state
	in p_stat is SACTIVE yet p_sflag is PS_STOPPING (while waiting
	for other LWPs to stop).  In that case, we don't want to adjust
	the parent's p_nstopchild count.
	[pgoyette, ticket #997]

sys/compat/linux/arch/arm/linux_ptrace.c	1.19
sys/compat/linux/arch/i386/linux_ptrace.c	1.31
sys/compat/linux/arch/powerpc/linux_ptrace.c	1.29

	Don't release proc_lock until we're done looking at things that
	are protected by the lock, particularly p_stat and p_waited.
	[pgoyette, ticket #998]

sys/kern/kern_exit.c				1.248

	Update value of p_stat before we release the proc_lock.
	[pgoyette, ticket #999]

sys/arch/arm/allwinner/awin_mmc.c		1.22

	Avoid a divide by 0 when unplugging a sd card.
	[bouyer, ticket #1006]

sys/arch/x86/x86/cpu.c				1.116

	Don't disable/re-enable interrupts if they are already disabled.
	Fixes i386 PAE kernels. PR#48196.
	[nat, ticket #984]

sys/arch/x86/x86/bus_dma.c			1.72-1.74

	- If we succeeded allocating a buffer that did not need bouncing
	before, but the buffer in the previous mapping did, clear the
	bounce bit. Fixes the ld_virtio.c bug with machines 8GB and
	dd if=/dev/zero of=crash bs=1g count=4.
	- Allocate with M_ZERO instead of doing memset
	- The panic string can take a format, use it.
	- When checking for the bounce buffer boundary,
	  check addr + len < limit, not addr < limit.
	[christos, ticket #1011]

external/gpl3/binutils/dist/binutils/arsup.c	1.2
lib/libc/net/getnetnamadr.c			1.43-1.44

	Resolve hostnames with "_".  PR#50367.
	[christos, ticket #1012]

sys/arch/x86/x86/sys_machdep.c			1.29

	Fix broken error handling leading to random crashes in 
	threaded programs.
	[christos, ticket #1013]

sys/fs/tmpfs/tmpfs_subr.c			1.101

	Fix crash when tmpfs fills up.  PR#50381.
	Fixes PR kern/50381.
	[leot, ticket #1023]
