A complete list of changes from the NetBSD 3.1.1 release to the NetBSD 3.1.2
release:

File						Revision(s)
----						--------
doc/README.files				patch
gnu/usr.bin/groff/tmac/mdoc.local		patch
sys/sys/param.h					patch

	Welcome to NetBSD 3.1.1_PATCH.

sys/dev/ic/pcdisplay_subr.c			1.33 via patch
sys/dev/ic/vga.c				1.95 via patch
sys/dev/ic/vga_raster.c				1.29 via patch
sys/dev/isa/ega.c				1.23 via patch
sys/dev/rasops/rasops.c				1.56 via patch

	Implement bounds checking in some places in display driver code to
	avoid the possibility of a local user panic.
	[mjf, ticket #1815]

dist/bind/bin/named/client.c			1.1.1.6 via patch
dist/bind/lib/dns/dispatch.c			1.1.1.7 via patch
dist/bind/lib/dns/include/dns/dispatch.h	1.1.1.5 via patch

	Fix for a security issue in BIND 9.3.x (CVE-2007-2926):
	Query id generation was cryptographically weak.
	[adrianp, ticket #1829]

sys/sys/socketvar.h				1.97
	Fix a bug in sblock() that has existed since revision 1.1 from BSD:
	correctly return an error if M_NOWAIT is passed to sblock() and the
	operation might block.  This remarkably subtle macro bug appears to
	be responsible for quite a few undiagnosed socket buffer corruption
	and mbuf-related kernel panics.
	[christos, ticket #1808]

sbin/ping/ping.c				1.83 - 1.85

	PR/28741: Michael Santos: ping does [not] drop root privileges
	[ghen, ticket #1818]

lib/libc/gen/Makefile.inc			1.143
lib/libc/gen/cgetcap.3				1.1 - 1.3
lib/libc/gen/getcap.3				delete

	Both libcurses and libc installed a getcap(3) manpage, and both used it
	as target for a bunch of MLINKS. This had the effect that whatever came
	last in install overwrote everything from the other camp.
	Solve this by renaming the libc page -- this makes sense because no
	function is really named "getcap" here.
	[bad, ticket #1821]

sys/kern/uipc_usrreq.c				1.98

	PR kern/32842:
	do not leak file descriptors when sending a datagram with SCM_RIGHTS
	fails. Patch from Gary Thorpe, based on changes in FreeBSD and work
	from Christian Biere.
	[martin, ticket #1820]

lib/libc/hash/sha2/sha2.c			patch
sys/crypto/ripemd160/rmd160.c			patch
sys/crypto/sha2/sha2.c				patch

	Fix SIGBUS issues on strict alignment issues. Use le32dec in RMD160
	as the data pointer to RMD160_Update doesn't have to be aligned.
	In SHA256_Update and SHA512_Update, only operate directly on the passed
	in data if no left-over in the context exists and the data is correctly
	aligned. The problem was exposed by the audit-packages rewrite in C
	and reported for the libnbcompat version in PR pkg/36662.
	[joerg, ticket #1812]

sys/arch/sparc/conf/GENERIC			1.200 via patch
sys/arch/sparc64/conf/GENERIC			1.88 via patch

	Remove iso(4) from GENERIC kernels.
	[adrianp, ticket #1826]

etc/etc.mac68k/ttys				1.18

	Replaced tty00 - tty07 with ttyZ0 - ttyZ1 because tty00 and friends
	don't exist (and symlinks aren't acceptable in many instances).
	[hauke, ticket #1834]

sys/dev/ieee1394/fwohci.c:			patch

	PR kern/36945 by Ross Philipson: Remove call to fwohci_desc_put() in
	an error path where fwohci_desc_get() has not been called yet.
	[christos, ticket #1835]

sys/dev/ic/mpt.c				1.9, 1.10 via patch
sys/dev/ic/mpt.h				1.6 via patch
sys/dev/ic/mpt_debug.c				patch
sys/dev/ic/mpt_mpilib.h				1.3 via patch
sys/dev/ic/mpt_netbsd.c				1.12 via patch

sys/dev/pci/mpt_pci.c				1.11 via patch
sys/dev/pci/pcidevs				patch
sys/dev/pci/pcidevs.h				regen
sys/dev/pci/pcidevs_data.h			regen

	Add support for newer SAS and similar devices to mpt(4). Tested with
	the LSI SAS1064 in a Sun x4200 server.
	These enhancements were developed by Garrett D'Amore and contributed
	to NetBSD by the TELES AG.
	[tron, ticket #1822]

sys/dev/ata/wd.c				1.345

	Add a workaround for drives with the LBA48 bug:
	if we get a "ID not found" error for a transfer crossing
	LBA48_THRESHOLD, and the drive is larger than 128GB,
	automatically add WD_QUIRK_FORCE_LBA48 to the drive's
	quirks and retry the transfers.  Hopefully this will
	obsolete the WD_QUIRK_FORCE_LBA48 quirk list ...
	[bouyer, ticket #1848]

doc/3RDPARTY					1.562
etc/namedb/root.cache				1.11

	Update to 2007110100 version
	[martti, ticket #1871, #1872]

usr.sbin/rpc.lockd/lock_proc.c			1.8

	Fix off-by-one error accessing "clnt_cache_addr" array which causes
	heap corruption. This will hopefully fix PR bin/37236.
	[tron, ticket #1873]

sys/netipsec/ipsec.c				1.34 via patch
sys/netipsec/ipsec_osdep.h			1.21 via patch
sys/netipsec/ipsec_output.c			1.23 via patch
sys/netipsec/xform_ah.c				1.19 via patch
sys/netipsec/xform_ipip.c			1.18 via patch

	The function ipsec4_get_ulp assumes that ip_off is in host order.
	This results in IPsec processing that is dependent on protocol
	and/or port can be bypassed.
	Bug report, analysis and initial fix from Karl Knutsson.
	Final patch and ok from degroote@
	[adrianp, ticket #1878]

sys/netinet6/ipcomp_input.c			1.28

	From FreeBSD:
	    In ipcomp6_input(), check 'md' not 'm' after a call to
	    m_pulldown(): 'm' may be a stale pointer at this point, and
	    we're interested in whether or not m_pulldown() failed.
	    Noticed by:     Coverity Prevent analysis tool
	Should fix PR 37410.
	[jdc, ticket #1879]

crypto/dist/openssl/ssl/ssl_lib.c		1.4

	apply a patch from openssl CVS to fix a remaining off-by-one error
	in an older security fix, see
	http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/480855/30/0/threaded
	(CVE-2007-4995)
	[drochner, ticket #1891]
xsrc/xfree/xc/lib/font/bitmap/pcfread.c		1.3

	Apply security fix for CVE-2008-0006.
	[tron, ticket #1896]
