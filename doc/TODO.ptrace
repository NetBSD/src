$NetBSD: TODO.ptrace,v 1.11.2.1 2017/04/21 16:51:16 bouyer Exp $

Items we (currently) plan to finish in the ptrace(2) field:

 - verify ppid of core dump generated with PT_DUMPCORE
   it must point to the real parent, not tracer
 - adapt OpenBSD regress test (regress/sys/ptrace/ptrace.c) for the ATF context
 - reiterate over FreeBSD tests and add missing ones if applicable
 - add PT_DUMPCORE tests in the ATF framework
 - add ATF tests for PT_WRITE_I and PIOD_WRITE_I - test mprotect restrictions
 - add tests for the procfs interface covering all functions available on the
   same level as ptrace(2)
 - remove 4.4BSD tracing with /proc, restrict /proc to Linux compat, to be
   superseded with kevent tracing, the original purpose of /proc debugging is
   long gone (performance issues with PT_WRITE_* and PT_READ_*)
 - research kevent support for tracing a process over a file descriptor,
   this means alternative to wait(2)-based events with passing events over the
   kqueue API - signal handlers are global per application and they clash with
   GUI toolkits (and perhaps other libraries) - this is long term wishlist in
   GDB for Linux - the current approach is to fork and debug through GDB remote
   protocol (this is how it is done in LLDB)
 - add support for PT_STEP, PT_GETREGS, PT_SETREGS, PT_GETFPREGS, PT_SETFPREGS
   in all ports
 - add proper implementation of PTRACE_VFORK for vfork(2)-like events
 - add ATF tests for SIGCHLD
 - fix more calls for netbsd32 compat
 - research ipkdb(4)
 - research kgdb(4)
 - check 64-bit debugger on 64-bit kernel tracing capabilities of 32-bit tracee

and of course: fix as many bugs as possible.

Features in ELF, DWARF, CTF, DTrace are out of scope of the above list.
