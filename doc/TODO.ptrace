$NetBSD: TODO.ptrace,v 1.31 2019/06/14 16:11:11 kamil Exp $

Items we (currently) plan to finish in the ptrace(2) field:

 - verify ppid of core dump generated with PT_DUMPCORE
   it must point to the real parent, not tracer
 - adapt OpenBSD regress test (regress/sys/ptrace/ptrace.c) for the ATF context
 - reiterate over FreeBSD tests and add missing ones if applicable
 - add PT_DUMPCORE tests in the ATF framework
 - research kevent support for tracing a process over a file descriptor,
   this means alternative to wait(2)-based events with passing events over the
   kqueue API - signal handlers are global per application and they clash with
   GUI toolkits (and perhaps other libraries) - this is long term wishlist in
   GDB for Linux - the current approach is to fork and debug through GDB remote
   protocol (this is how it is done in LLDB)
 - add ATF tests for SIGCHLD
 - research kgdb(4)

and of course: fix as many bugs as possible.

Features in ELF, DWARF, CTF, DTrace are out of scope of the above list.
