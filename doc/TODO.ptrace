Items we (currently) plan to finish in the ptrace(2) field:

 - verify ppid of core dump generated with PT_DUMPCORE
   it must point to the real parent, not tracer
 - add PT_DUMPCORE tests in the ATF framework
 - research kgdb(4)

and of course: fix as many bugs as possible.

Features in ELF, DWARF, CTF, DTrace are out of scope of the above list.
