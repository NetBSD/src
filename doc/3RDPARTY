#	$NetBSD: 3RDPARTY,v 1.727 2009/10/26 02:51:01 christos Exp $
#
# This file contains a list of the software that has been integrated into
# NetBSD where we are not the primary maintainer.
#
# When you make changes to this software, be sure to discuss it with the
# maintainer and contribute your patches.  Divergence from the official
# sources is not desirable, and should be avoided as much as possible.
#
# When importing, please deal with the RCS IDs in this way:
#   1. Preserve the RCS IDs in the files by removing the $ signs from
#      the IDs before you do the import.
#   2. After the import, add NetBSD RCS IDs to all of the files.
#
# A few notes on the format of this file (for the benefit of
# 3dparty2html):
#
# 1.) Any line whose first non-whitespace character is # is a comment
# 2.) Entries are separated by blank lines
# 3.) Every package needs at least the following entries: Package,
#     Version, Current Vers, and Maintainer.
# 4.) Where a field has multiple lines of information, the field tag
#     should be repeated on each line, except:
# 5.) The Notes: field tag should appear on a line by itself.  All
#     remaining lines until the end of the record are notes.

	 they are too different or do not exist anymore:
	    gethnamaddr.c getnetent.c getnetnamadr.c sethostent.c
	 Others like getaddrinfo.c could be merged with isc, but it seems

Todo[3]: net/base64.c is imported from bind but should be moved from net
	 to isc/base64.c.
Todo[4]: Re-entrant functions of net/*
Todo[5]: Reconcile the doc directory.

Mailing List:	ipsec-tools-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
Responsible:	manu, vanhu, mgrooms
License:	BSD (3-clause)
Notes:
ipsec-tools is maintained within NetBSD src tree in src/crypto/dist/ipsec-tools
We don't run ipsec-tools' configure as part of the NetBSD build. configure
generated files are available in the NetBSD source tree at:
  src/lib/libipsec/config.h
  src/lib/libipsec/package_version.h
When configure.ac is updated, run the following:
  cd src/crypto/dist/ipsec-tools
  ./bootstrap
  ./configure --enable-adminport --enable-hybrid --enable-frag \
  	      --enable-natt --enable-dpd 
Then copy package_version.h to src/lib/libipsec and merge config.h with
src/lib/libipsec/config.h (it needs some manual tweaking)

NOTE: As NetBSD HEAD and ipsec-tools HEAD are just the same thing, 
NetBSD-current always contains latest ipsec-tools code. On the other hand,
ipsec-tools has stable branches (e.g.: ipsec-tools-0_7-branch), which 
are manually pulled up to NetBSD stable branches (e.g.: netbsd-4 is regularly
sync with ipsec-tools-0_7-branch)

Notes:
IPv6 part is based on KAME/NetBSD142 SNAP as of early June 2000, with
more conservative implementation policy.
IPsec part is based on KAME/NetBSD14 SNAP as of 12 June 2000.
Please do not make too many diff-unfriendly changes (like indentation change,
KNF police).  We need to take diffs across KAME snapshots on upgrades.
To identify kernel version, check net.inet6.ip6.kame_version, or KAME_VERSION
in sys/netinet6/in6.h.  No script is available for upgrades.
"KAME" branch is used for kernel merge work purposes.
http://www.kame.net/dev/cvsweb.cgi/kame/COVERAGE has functionality comparison
among KAME/*BSD, *BSD-current and recent *BSD releases.

local changes (should always try to bring them back to master openssh tree,
markus is very cooperative about it):
- default for PermitRootLogin is set to "no"
- IgnoreRootRhosts added
- look at login.conf to check valid user/access list
- krb5 support re-added
- hack in cipher.c #ifdef ACCS because we are missing EVP_acss
  when someone imports openssl, we can remove this.
- added moduli from portable openssh
- added USE_PAM patches and auth_pam.[ch] from portable openssh
- conditionalize login_cap
- conditionalize bsd_auth
- restore krb5, krb4, afs, skey
- bring in hpn patches, disable mt aes cipher, keep speedups and cipher none
- fix ctype macro arguments
- umac is broken, disable it
- better ~homedir handling
- netbsd style tunnels
- urandom, xhome, chrootdir, rescuedir NetBSD handling
- utmp/utmpx handling
- handle tty posix_vdisable properly
- handle setuid and unsetuid the posix way instead of setresuid()
- add all missing functions
- always bump major when importing to avoid api problems.

Notes:
BSD support was removed from 2.4.0; I added it back and removed
some GPL pieces. Multilink support is missing. Repeated pings to
Paulus have not yielded results. I've retrofitted pppdump to use
net/zlib, and <net/ppp-comp.h> and I now maintain sys-bsd.c. This
is clearly a pain. I have not tested the modules code, neither our
makefiles make it easy to construct a module, but I left one there
as an example.
TDB code as found in 2.4.x, x>1 is under the GPL.  Therefore, we're
using the version found in 2.4.1.
