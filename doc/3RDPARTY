#
# This file contains a list of the software that has been integrated into
# NetBSD where we are not the primary maintainer.
#
# When you make changes to this software, be sure to discuss it with the
# maintainer and contribute your patches.  Divergence from the official
# sources is not desirable, and should be avoided as much as possible.
#
# When importing, please deal with the RCS IDs in this way:
#   1. Preserve the RCS IDs in the files by removing the $ signs from
#      the IDs before you do the import.
#   2. After the import, add NetBSD RCS IDs to all of the files.
#
# A few notes on the format of this file (for the benefit of
# 3rdparty2html):
#
# 1.) Any line whose first non-whitespace character is # is a comment;
# 2.) Entries are separated by blank lines;
# 3.) Every package needs at least the Package, Version, Current Vers,
#     and Maintainer fields;
# 4.) Where a field has multiple lines of information, the field tag
#     should be repeated on each line, except:
# 5.) The Notes: field tag should appear on a line by itself; all
#     remaining lines until the end of the record are notes.

	 Others like getaddrinfo.c could be merged with isc, but it seems

Todo[5]: Reconcile the doc directory.

Location:	external/gpl3/gcc/dist
Notes:
As of April 2014, there are three versions of gcc in the NetBSD tree.
In the long term, we expect that there will often be two versions,
in the "gcc" and "gcc.old" directories.  Having two versions allows
migration from one version of gcc to another to happen for one port
at a time, instead of for all ports simultaneously.
When importing a new version of external/gpl3/gcc.old:
	- copy the current version of external/gpl3/gcc
	- import it to a "NETBSD" vendor branch in externalgpl3/gcc.old
Before importing a new version of external/gpl3/gcc:
	- delete all .cvsignore and .gitignore files
	- delete java ada fortran their libraries and testsuites
	- delete libffi zlib boehm-gc 
	- update gcc/version.c for the NetBSD GCC date
	- use core/c++/objc/testsuite tarballs
	- you can use the gcc2netbsd script for the above (except version)

Notes:
ipsec-tools is maintained within NetBSD src tree in src/crypto/dist/ipsec-tools
We don't run ipsec-tools' configure as part of the NetBSD build. configure
generated files are available in the NetBSD source tree at:
  src/lib/libipsec/config.h
  src/lib/libipsec/package_version.h
When configure.ac is updated, run the following:
  cd src/crypto/dist/ipsec-tools
  ./bootstrap
  ./configure --enable-adminport --enable-hybrid --enable-frag \
  	      --enable-natt --enable-dpd
Then copy package_version.h to src/lib/libipsec and merge config.h with
src/lib/libipsec/config.h (it needs some manual tweaking)

NOTE: As NetBSD HEAD and ipsec-tools HEAD are just the same thing,
NetBSD-current always contains latest ipsec-tools code. On the other hand,
ipsec-tools has stable branches (e.g.: ipsec-tools-0_7-branch), which
are manually pulled up to NetBSD stable branches (e.g.: netbsd-4 is regularly
sync with ipsec-tools-0_7-branch)

Please do not make too many diff-unfriendly changes (like indentation change,
KNF police).  We need to take diffs across KAME snapshots on upgrades.
To identify kernel version, check net.inet6.ip6.kame_version, or KAME_VERSION
in sys/netinet6/in6.h.  No script is available for upgrades.
"KAME" branch is used for kernel merge work purposes.

local changes (should always try to bring them back to master openssh tree,
markus is very cooperative about it):
- default for PermitRootLogin is set to "no"
- IgnoreRootRhosts added
- look at login.conf to check valid user/access list
- krb5 support re-added
- hack in cipher.c #ifdef ACCS because we are missing EVP_acss
  when someone imports openssl, we can remove this.
- added moduli from portable openssh
- added USE_PAM patches and auth_pam.[ch] from portable openssh
  (see if there is any difference between the current version of opensshX.Yp1
   and the new opensshZ.Wp1) and apply them.
- conditionalize login_cap
- conditionalize bsd_auth
- restore krb5, krb4, afs, skey
- bring in hpn patches, disable mt aes cipher, keep speedups and cipher none
- fix ctype macro arguments
- umac is broken, disable it
- better ~homedir handling
- netbsd style tunnels
- urandom, xhome, chrootdir, rescuedir NetBSD handling
- utmp/utmpx handling
- handle tty posix_vdisable properly
- handle setuid and unsetuid the posix way instead of setresuid()
- add all missing functions
- always bump major when importing to avoid api problems.
- make compile with gcc-4.5; const fixes, fileno() checks, shadow fixes.

BSD support was removed from 2.4.0; I added it back and removed
some GPL pieces. Multilink support is missing. Repeated pings to
Paulus have not yielded results. I've retrofitted pppdump to use
net/zlib, and <net/ppp-comp.h> and I now maintain sys-bsd.c. This
is clearly a pain. I have not tested the modules code, neither our
makefiles make it easy to construct a module, but I left one there
as an example.

 Only X4??src-1 to X4??src-6 were imported. X4??src-7 contains postscript
 files which we don't need in our tree.
 ALL changes must be sent back to the XFree86 repository. Patches should
 be submitted back via http://bugzilla.xfree86.org.

Package:	services, protocols

Location:	etc
Notes:
1. Build package net/iana-etc
2. Add NetBSD rcsid to the generated protocols and services in the package
   work area.
3. Append the local services from the current services file.
4. Run:
	services_mkdb -u services > /usr/src/etc/services
	cp protocols /usr/src/etc/protocols
5. Fix protocols
   - fix manet alias to MANET; giving an alias with the same name is a no/op
   - protocol 84 is defined for as ttp and iptm, merge the two entries since
     libc getprotoent() does not read the whole file and merge in the "files"
     implementation.
