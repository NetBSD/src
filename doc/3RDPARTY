#	$NetBSD: 3RDPARTY,v 1.132 2003/08/05 12:09:12 itojun Exp $
#
# This file contains a list of the software that has been integrated into
# NetBSD where we are not the primary maintainer.
#
# When you make changes to this software, be sure to discuss it with the
# maintainer and contribute your patches.  Divergence from the official
# sources is not desirable, and should be avoided as much as possible.
#
# When importing, please deal with the RCS IDs in this way:
#   1. Preserve the RCS IDs in the files by removing the $ signs from
#      the IDs before you do the import.
#   2. After the import, add NetBSD RCS IDs to all of the files.
#
# A few notes on the format of this file (for the benefit of
# 3dparty2html):
#
# 1.) Any line whose first non-whitespace character is # is a comment
# 2.) Entries are separated by blank lines
# 3.) Every package needs at least the following entries: Package,
#     Version, Current Vers, and Maintainer.
# 4.) Where a field has multiple lines of information, the field tag
#     should be repeated on each line, except:
# 5.) The Notes: field tag should appear on a line by itself.  All
#     remaining lines until the end of the record are notes.

Notes:
bind2netbsd script to import into src/dist/bind.
The Makefiles in src/usr.sbin/bind are not handled by the script.
do not try to use libc resolver from src/usr.sbin/bind, it adds
too much constraint between bind and libc, as well as problem with
_res declaration differences.  DNSSEC portion is disabled.
On switching to BIND9: waiting for the release of 9.3.x, as 9.2.x has some
issues (A6 queries for glue, for instance).

Package:	bind/resolver

Mailing List:
Responsible:	vixie
Notes:
Mostly imported with cvs import.  Makefile's, etc, are not.
upgrade to BIND8 resolver can only happen with libc major bump (otherwise
it needs too much effort).  Reasons: (1) need to support binaries that use
BIND4 resolver API (res_init), and need to support BIND8 API.  we practically
need to maintain both BIND4 _res and BIND8 _res.  (2) amount of local changes.
nsswitch/nsdispatch need to be reimplemented.

more conservative implementation policy.
IPsec part is based on KAME/NetBSD14 SNAP as of 12 June 2000.
Please do not make too many diff-unfriendly changes (like indentation change,
KNF police).  We need to take diffs across KAME snapshots on upgrades.
To identify kernel version, check net.inet6.ip6.kame_version, or KAME_VERSION
in sys/netinet6/in6.h.  No script is available for upgrades.
"KAME" branch is used for kernel merge work purposes.

Talk to mrg before importing any new version.  (less 381's configure

local changes (should always try to bring them back to master openssh tree,
markus is very cooperative about it):

- IgnoreRootRhosts added
- look at login.conf to check valid user/access list
- ssh{,d}_config -> ssh{,d}.conf (can't bring it back) (1.5 branch only)
1.5 branch uses /etc for configuration files, while current/1.6 uses /etc/ssh.
http://www.openbsd.org/advisories/ssh_channelalloc.txt is integrated
manually to 1.5 branch.  version date "20020307" identifies the fix.
http://www.openssh.com/txt/preauth.adv is integrated manually to 1.5 branch.

BSD support was removed from 2.4.0; I added it back and removed

Paulus have not yielded results. I've retrofitted pppdump to use
our zlib, and <net/ppp-comp.h> and I now maintain sys-bsd.c. This
is clearly a pain. I have not tested the modules code, neither our
makefiles make it easy to construct a module, but I left one there
as an example.

Package:	zlib
Version:	1.1.4
Current Vers:	1.1.4
Maintainer:	Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler <zlib@gzip.org>
Archive Site:	http://www.gzip.org/zlib/
Mailing List:
Responsible:	gwr, tron
Notes:
The sources were integrated into src/lib/libz as usual on *nix,
and partially duplicated under src/sys/lib/libz for the kernel.
The header zconf.h was "boiled down" to the minimum for *BSD.
The Makefile is completely new (*BSD style, of course).  Lastly,
the file gzio.c was changed to allow -DNO_DEFLATE to eliminate
all references to deflate.c and friends, which permits building
a really small zcat implementation.  (src/distrib/utils/zcat)
