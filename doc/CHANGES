	netns: Support for XNS in the kernel and userspace has been
		removed. [matt 20060825]

	less: Updated to version 394.  [mrg 20061025]

	i386: Change GENERIC, GENERIC.MP, GENERIC.MPACPI, GENERIC_LAPTOP,
		INSTALL, INSTALL.MP, INSTALL_LAPTOP, and DISKLESS kernels
		so that they are smaller and faster by removing support
		for actual i386 CPUs (which lack write protection in
		supervisor mode, which requires a costly workaround) and
		math coprocessor emulation.  Coprocessor emulation is
		retained in the LAPTOP kernels, but not in the others.
		Where it is known that a configuration cannot be run
		with particular CPUs (i486 in *MP kernels) remove that
		support as well.  Compile all kernels with appropriate
		architecture and tuning flags (reduces size, makes things
		faster).  Those requiring support for machines with i386
		CPU or lacking coprocessor can use the *SMALL or *TINY
		kernels. [tls 20061101]
	useradd(8): Change the default shell for newly added users to
		/bin/sh. [pavel 20061102]

	evbarm: Add support for Certance CP-3100 [scw 20061108]
	tmpfs: Audit kqueue notifications and add several regression
		tests for them.  [jmmv 20061109]
	vnd: Make this work with files stored on file systems without
		the bmap and strategy operations.  This includes tmpfs
		and smbfs.  [jmmv 20061109]
	paxctl: Enable as a tool, and add make rules to run paxctl on
		binaries to what PROG_PAX is set. [christos 20061110]
	lfs_cleanerd: Move from /usr/libexec to /libexec so that the
		root file system can be safely placed on a LFS volume.
		[jmmv 20061110]
	tmpfs: Drop experimental status and enable it by default in the
		GENERIC kernels of amd64, i386, macppc and sparc64.
		[jmmv 20061110]
	ssp: New library modelled after the gcc libssp. Stack protector
		code from OpenBSD. Enable stack protection both in
		the kernel and userland code by using USE_SSP=yes in
		/etc/mk.conf [christos 20061111]
	uucp: Removed from base; package can be found in pkgsrc
		[christos 20061111]

		offload support. [yamt 20061124]
	ahcisata(4): Added driver for AHCI 1.0 and 1.1 compliant SATA
		controllers. [bouyer 20061130]
	shark: add support for igsfb at ofbus. [macallan 20061207]
	mfi(4): driver for LSI Logic & Dell MegaRAID SAS RAID controller.
		Ported from OpenBSD, tested on i386 and amd64.
		[bouyer 20061217]
	bnx(4): driver for Broadcom NetXtreme II 10/100/1000 Ethernet

		[skrll 20061229]
	ug(4): driver for the Abit uGuru hardware system monitor,
		contributed by Mihai Chelaru. [xtraeme 20070106]
	i386, amd64: remove option COMPAT_386BSD_MBRPART from default
		kernels.  NetBSD has not used partition ID 0x165 for many,
		many years, and the presence of this option in INSTALL
		kernels can cause overwriting of existing FreeBSD
		installations when sysinst writes back the disklabel.
		Those with very, very old NetBSD installations may find
		that they must update their fdisk partition tables to use
		partition ID 0x169 for their NetBSD partitions. [tls 20070124]
	build: 'make iso-image' in src/ (or build.sh iso-image) will build
		iso images, eventually bootable, using in-tree tools.
		[bouyer 20070306]
	i386, amd64: switch bootable iso images to native boot format, and add
		different bootable kenrels on the iso images. Enable ACPI
		in default INSTALL and GENERIC kernels. [bouyer 20070306]
	ataraid(4): Add support for Via V-RAID. [garbled 20070326]
	wm(4): Added support for the Intel i82801H (ICH8) gigabit ethernet
