	return failure if swap is full and there are no free physical pages.
	have malloc() use this flag if M_CANFAIL is passed to it.
	use M_CANFAIL to allow amap_extend() to fail when memory is scarce.
	this should prevent most of the remaining hangs in low-memory
	situations.
	[skrll, ticket #1156]

usr.bin/progress/progress.c			1.7

	Use an even more elaborate wait loop; it turns out we have a

Merged mac68k and macppc keayboards, since they are the same. The file
could move to <arch/mac> if one day we create it.

	Added a french keyboard layout.
	Fixed french keymap: option was not mapped correctly, thus making
	impossible to use |{}[] (tested).
	Added jp keymap from PR/15438, and sf, sv, de and uk keymaps from
	OpenBSD. (all untested).
	[manu, ticket #1183]

sys/net/if_ethersubr.c				1.105

	Ignore multicast PPPoE packets ASAP.
	This improves performance a lot on slow machines behind a cable modem.
	Protect it with PPPOE_SERVER as a reminder that this will have to be
	changed if we add PPPoE server code in the kernel one day.
	[aymeric, ticket #1188]

share/misc/style				1.23

	Return value style update (no parentheses)
	[mason, ticket #1191]

	mbsrtowcs_priv template:
        	n == 0 is not an error. it's a valid input.
	_citrus_NONE_ctype_mbsrtowcs:
		fix a typo that causes SEGV.
	while i'm here, make them similar each other.
	when s==0, wctomb should initialize its internal state and return if
	encodings have state dependency or not. Fix part of PR 18269.
	In _RESTART_BEGIN macro, don't use external variable directly.
	- add missing _CEI_TO_EI/_TO_CEI.
	- add missing _STATE_NEEDS_EXPLICIT_INIT checks.
	- more comment.
	- add missing _CEI_TO_EI/_TO_CEI.
	- don't use 'cl' before assert it's non NULL.
	- handle s==NULL case of wcrtomb.
	- add a comment about it.

	[yamt, ticket #1202]

sbin/fdisk/fdisk.c				1.55

	Add partition type 0xaf for Apple HFS.
	[jdarrow, ticket #1205]

sbin/fdisk/fdisk.c				1.56

	Make the -l flage more useful, by actually printing the systype number
	alongside the sysid string (instead of just the array index of the
	struct part_type they are found in).
	Now fdisk -l shows the familiar 169 for NetBSD, 165 for FreeBSD or
	386BSD or old NetBSD, and other possibly-familiar (131 for Linux
	native,	015 for Ext. Partition - LBA) values in with their correct
	numbers.
	[jdarrow, ticket #1206]

sys/uvm/uvm_bio.c				1.27

	For PMAP_CACHE_VIVT platforms, make UBC_RELEASE_UNMAP evaluate to TRUE,
