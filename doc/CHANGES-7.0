gnu/usr.bin/groff/tmac/mdoc.local		patched by hand
sys/sys/param.h					patched by hand

	Welcome to 7.0_BETA!

sys/dev/usb/xhci.c				1.24

	PR/49091: xhci: wrong wMaxPacketSize value

	While this is correct according to the specification only fixed sizes
	are allowed, i.e. 512 for SS, etc. Maybe these should be used?
	[skrll, ticket #3]


sys/kern/kern_rndpool.c				1.7
sys/kern/kern_rndq.c				1.27

	buf is not guaranteed to be aligned; don't *(uint32_t *) it.
	done is not guaranteed to be aligned; don't *(uint32_t *) it.
	Fixes PR kern/49098.
	[riastradh, ticket #4]

external/gpl3/binutils/dist/bfd/ChangeLog	1.6
external/gpl3/binutils/dist/bfd/elflink.c	1.8

	Apply change from upstream to fix PR/48709 - port-alpha/48709: static
	threaded programs crash.

	With this fix the new weak symbol's st_other is not merged in, i.e. NOPV
	is not copied from the libc __libc_thr_init.

	* elflink.c (_bfd_elf_merge_symbol): If merging a new weak
	symbol that will be skipped, we don't have a new definition.
	[skrll, ticket #5]


sys/dev/usb/motg.c				1.7
sys/dev/usb/motg.c				1.8

	Trailing whitespace.

	Make this compile when DIAGNOSTIC isn't defined.
	[skrll, ticket #6]

usr.sbin/postinstall/postinstall		1.177
usr.sbin/postinstall/postinstall		1.178
usr.sbin/postinstall/postinstall		1.179

	Check for and delete ${DEST_DIR}/@RUNDIR@, not /@RUNDIR@.
	Also remove an unnecessary eval in do_dhcpcdrundir and
	fix a typo in the description.

	Quoting fixes in several eval commands.

	In get_makevar, ask make to recursively expand the variable,
	not just print the unexpanded value.  This is done by
	using make -V '${VAR}' instead of make -V 'VAR'.
	[apb, ticket #8]


usr.sbin/postinstall/postinstall		1.176

	FONTCONFIG_DIR not existing does not need to be fixed.
	[apb, ticket #9]
