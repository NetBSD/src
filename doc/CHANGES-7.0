sys/dev/usb/xhci.c				1.24

	PR/49091: xhci: wrong wMaxPacketSize value
	While this is correct according to the specification only fixed sizes
	are allowed, i.e. 512 for SS, etc. Maybe these should be used?
	[skrll, ticket #3]

sys/kern/kern_rndpool.c				1.7
sys/kern/kern_rndq.c				1.27

	buf is not guaranteed to be aligned; don't *(uint32_t *) it.

external/gpl3/binutils/dist/bfd/elflink.c	1.8

	Apply change from upstream to fix PR/48709 - port-alpha/48709: static
	threaded programs crash.

	is not copied from the libc __libc_thr_init.
	* elflink.c (_bfd_elf_merge_symbol): If merging a new weak
	symbol that will be skipped, we don't have a new definition.
	[skrll, ticket #5]

	fix a typo in the description.
	Quoting fixes in several eval commands.
	In get_makevar, ask make to recursively expand the variable,
	not just print the unexpanded value.  This is done by
	using make -V '${VAR}' instead of make -V 'VAR'.

	Remove dhclient's dependency on /usr/lib.
	[christos, ticket #133]

lib/libperfuse/ops.c				1.75

	Do not trust the filesystem's readdir to give us nul-terminated
	file names.

lib/libutil/parsedate.y				1.17-1.20
tests/lib/libutil/t_parsedate.c			1.8-1.13

	Fix some errors in parsedate(3)'s handling of local time
	without an explicit time zone, make the second and third
	arguments independent of each other (previously, if one
	was NULL then the other was ignored), and add more test
	cases.  Fixes PR lib/47916.
	[apb, ticket #135]

sys/fs/puffs/puffs_vnops.c			1.188-1.194

	If we truncate a file open for writing, make sure we zero-fill the end
	of the last page, otherwise if the file is later truncated to a larger
	size (creating a hole), that area will not return zeroes as it should.
	[manu, ticket #136]

lib/libperfuse/ops.c				1.76

	Report allocated bytes on FS correctly, instead of using file size
	(which is wrong for sparse files).

	When creating a vnode with vcache_get() mark the vnode VI_CHANGING

external/bsd/openresolv/dist/resolvconf.conf.5.in 1.10-1.11

	Import openresolv-3.6.0 with the following changes:

	  *  dnsmasq subscriber no longer moans if it hasn't written a pidfile
	  *  Ensure that name_server_blacklist works for more than one option.
	     Thanks to Frederic Barthelery.
	  *  unbound_insecure can disable DNSSEC for all domains processed.
	  *  local_nameservers now defaults to
	     127.* 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 ::1
	     and is used instead of a hard coded list.
	  *  Allow the disabling of resolvconf or optionally an individual
	     subscriber.
	  *  Don't wait around trying to create a lock if we don't have
	     permission.
	  *  resolv_conf_passthrough=NULL will update resolv.conf to match
	     only what is configured in resolvconf.conf and ignore any
	     interface configuration.

lib/libc/resolv/res_mkquery.c			1.14

	PR/48475: YAMAGUCHI Takanori: EDNS option broken with unbound. struct
	querybuf in net/gethnamaddr.c defines MAXPACKET to 64K. This in turn
	gets passed down until it reached res_nopt(..., answer, anslen), where
	the size of the buffer must fit in 16 bits. Unfortunately we end up
	being one more than the max so we end up sending a 0 as the size and
	unbound does not like that. Instead we clip now to 64K - 1, and

	rump kernel starts from 0.
	[gson, ticket #303]

sys/dev/dkwedge/dk.c				1.75-1.76

	Really provide disk properties, the old code computed values that
	were never attached to the device.
	[mlelstv, ticket #304]

sbin/ccdconfig/ccdconfig.c			1.56

	[mlelstv, ticket #306]

tests/lib/librumpclient/h_execthr.c		1.3

	Update hardcoded fd expectations now that rump kernels open 0/1/2.
	(since we exec, it's convenient to just assume the values of first
	4 fds)
	[gson, ticket #307]

distrib/sets/lists/man/mi			1.1491

sys/arch/x86/include/specialreg.h		1.79-1.80
usr.sbin/cpuctl/arch/i386.c			1.59

	Update some cpuid related values:
	- Add XSAVECC, XGETBV, XSAVES, SMAP and PQE
	- Change XINUSE to XGETBV
	- Add new cache descripter value (0xc3)
	- Update signatures for the follwing CPUs:
	  - Core M-5xxx
	  - Core i7 Extreme

	[msaitoh, ticket #310]

sys/dev/pci/pcireg.h				1.96
sys/dev/pci/ppb.c				1.53-1.54

	- Modify message of PCIe capability version. This field
	  (PCIE_XCAP_VER_MASK) is not specification's version
	  number but the capability structure's version number.
	  To avoid confusion, print "PCI Express capability version x".
	- The max number of PCIe lane is not 16 but 32. Fix the bug
	   using with macro.
	- Use macro instead of magic number.
	- Gb/s -> GT/s

	Rename PCIE_XCAP_VER_* macros to avoid confusion.
	[msaitoh, ticket #311]

sys/dev/pci/pci_subr.c				1.127-1.132
sys/dev/pci/pcireg.h				1.97-1.99

	Always print the "Slot implemented" bit in the PCIe Capabilities
	Register using onoff().

	- Add some PCI subclass and interfaces.
	- The interface of PCI_SUBCLASS_BRIDGE_RACEWAY is not decoded yet.
	- Fix typo in a message.
	- Add/Modify some comments.

	Fix a bug that the specification revision of the Power Management
	function was incorrectly printed in the output of capability "list".

	- Cleanup pci_conf_print_caplist. Use table. The reason why it loops
	  twice is that some capabilities appear multiple times (e.g.
	  HyperTransport cap).
	- Print the specification revision of Power Management and AGP not in
	  the capability list part but in the detail part.

	Add some HyperTransport related defines required for MSI.

	Stylistic and comment improvements, fix two bugs:
	- aaa and daa were reversed. Same as *BSDs.
	- fix operand order of shld and shrd. Same as *BSDs.

	Add support for sysenter, sysexit, vmptrld, vmptrst and getsec.
	[msaitoh, ticket #313]

	Avoid a user-triggerable kmem_alloc(0).
	[maxv, ticket #314]

sys/sys/cdefs_elf.h				1.47

	Add a macro to mark a symbol as weak. Use it to mark the end of a
	linker set, as empty linker sets otherwise violate the C aliasing
	rules by presenting zero sized objects.
	[joerg, ticket #316]

sys/conf/Makefile.kern.inc			1.179

sys/arch/sparc64/include/psl.h			1.54-1.55
sys/arch/sparc64/sparc64/cpu.c			1.121

	Change getver() into a constant function since Version Register (%ver)
	is read only and its value is constant. This change reduces multiple
	%ver reads to one in the functions which uses a number of CPU_IS_*
	macros.

	Use GETVER_CPU_* macros.

	ports.

	This allows all (at least ATARITT and FALCON, which have certain users)
	gzipped kernel binaries put into 1440KB 2HD floppy so that users can
	load these kernels on the native TOS using LOADBSD.TTP utility for

	[msaitoh, ticket #325]

usr.sbin/cpuctl/arch/i386.c			1.60-1.64

	Add code to detect hypervisor (from FreeBSD, ported by Kengo Nakahara).

	Move some printf()s from cpu_probe_base_features() to identifycpu(),
	to avoid extra (unintended) output from the "ucode" command.

	Fix output if ci_tsc_freq is 0.

	Don't print garbage if the ioctl to get the microcode version
	failed.
	[msaitoh, ticket #326]

	Update bind to 9.10.1-P1. CVE-2014-8500.
	[spz, ticket #349]

sys/ufs/ufs/extattr.h				1.11

	Bump UFS1 extended attribute max name length to 256.
	For extended attribute name max length, kernel filesystem-independant
	code use either EXTATTR_MAXNAMELEN (BSD API) or XATTR_NAME_MAX (Linux
	API), which are both defined as KERNEL_NAME_MAX and fits Linux limit
	of 255 without training \0.
	UFS1 code had a lower limit that broke Linux compatibility. We can bump
	the limit without sacrifying backward compatibility, because:
	1) There is no API exposing this limit outside the kernel. Upper kernel
	layers have a larger limit handle the increase without a hitch
	2) Each attribute has its own backing store in the fileystem, the name
	of the backing store matching the attribute name. A newer kernel can
	create/read/write backing store for longer attribute names and will
	have no problem with existing shorter names.

	  - The LPCIB_PCI_PMBASE and LPCIB_PCI_GPIO register are alike PCI
	    BAR but not completely compatible with it. It's ok because the
	    registers' addresses are out of BAR0-BAR5(0x10-0x24) and are
	    located in the device-dependent header.
	    The PMBASE and GPIO registers define the base address and the
	    type but not describe the size. The size is fixed to 128bytes.

	Introduce a new switch type, PSWITCH_TYPE_RADIO, to be used to
	report to userland hardware radio switch changes.  powerd(8)
	will call a "radio_button" script to handle the event.  This
	script can e.g. start or stop wpa_supplicant.  Update wpi(4)
	to report PSWITCH_TYPE_RADIO events to sysmon.

external/mit/xorg/server/drivers/xf86-video-intel/Makefile 1.17-1.20

	Update the xf86-video-intel driver to 2.99.917.
	[snj, ticket #439]

sys/arch/evbarm/rpi/rpi_machdep.c		1.56

	Fix Raspberry Pi framebuffer byte order for newer firmware
	versions.
	[jmcneill, ticket #440]

sys/netinet6/in6.h				1.82
sys/netinet6/in6_src.c				1.56
sys/netinet6/ip6_input.c			1.150
sys/netinet6/ip6_output.c			1.161
sys/netinet6/ip6_var.h				1.64
sys/netinet6/mld6.c				1.62

	Add net.inet6.ip6.prefer_tempaddr sysctl knob so that we can prefer
	IPv6 temporary addresses as the source address.
	[pettai, ticket #441]

sbin/ifconfig/af_inet6.c			1.31

	Display the IPv6 address flags autoconf and temporary.
	[pettai, ticket #442]

etc/defaults/rc.conf				1.129
etc/rc.d/wpa_supplicant				1.6

	It doesn't make sense to start wpa_supplicant from an rc.d script
	without the -B flag, so always prepend it to $rc_flags.
	[jmcneill, ticket #443]

sys/dev/i2c/i2c.c				1.46

	More correctly handle I2C exec ioctls with both a command and write
	data phase. Previously the data phase of ioctl writes was sending
	uninitialized kernel stack to the addressed device.
	[jakllsch, ticket #444]

usr.sbin/sysinst/configmenu.c			1.3

	Handle empty input gracefully by simply jumping back to the config
	menu.
	[snj, ticket #445]

sys/external/bsd/vchiq/dist/interface/vchiq_arm/vchiq_arm.c 1.15

	More count vs ret confusion. Need to send notification if count != 0.
	[skrll, ticket #446]

sys/uvm/uvm_map.c				1.332

	Skip busy anon pages in uvm_map_clean().
	We shouldn't be messing with pages that someone else has busy,
	and uvm_map_clean() is just advisory for amap mappings.
	[chs, ticket #447]

sys/arch/x86/pci/ichlpcib.c			1.46

	The PMBASE and GPIOBASE registers are not compatible with
	the PCI spec and the map sizes are fixed to 128bytes. The
	pci_mapreg_submap() function has a code to check the range
	of the BAR. The PCI_MAPREG_IO_SIZE() macro returns lower
	than 128bytes on some machines. This makes iz impossible to
	use pci_mapreg_submap(). Use pci_conf_read() and
	bus_space_map() directly.

	Import Postfix 2.11.3. Changes since version 2.11.1:
	- Fix for DMARC implementations based on SPF policy plus DKIM Milter.
	  The PREPEND access/policy action added headers ABOVE Postfix's own
	  Received: header, exposing Postfix's own Received: header to Milters
	  (protocol violation) and hiding the PREPENDed header from Milters.
	  PREPENDed headers are now added BELOW Postfix's own Received: header
	  and remain visible to Milters.
	- The Postfix SMTP server logged an incorrect client name in reject
	  messages for check_reverse_client_hostname_access and
	  check_reverse_client_hostname_{mx,ns}_access. They replied with the
	  verified client name, instead of the name that was rejected.
	- The TLS client logged that an anonymous TLS connection was
	  "Untrusted", instead of "Anonymous".
	- Fix for configurations that prepend message headers with Postfix
	  access maps, policy servers or Milter applications. Postfix now hides
	  its own Received: header from Milters and exposes prepended headers
	  to Milters, regardless of the mechanism used to prepend a header.
	  This fix reverts a partial solution that was released on October 13,
	  2014, and replaces it with a complete solution.

	Handle LOCAL_PEERID for socketpair() connected sockets which

	1. move the code that sets the peerid structure into connect1().
	This handles so2.  The datagram code calls connect2 twice with

	Build Mesa 7 r300_dri.so for x86 platforms.

	sets.subr: support machine=<xxx>, machine_arch=<xxx>, and
	machine_cpu=<xxx> tags.
	[mrg, ticket #559]

sys/arch/shark/conf/Makefile.shark.inc		1.24

	Put -fno-unwind-tables into CFLAGS instead of COPTS - the old
	version caused DEFCOPTS to not be propagated into COPTS, which
	meant there was no optimization for the kernel.

	- Sync ixg(4) up to FreeBSD r230572.
	   - Fix in the interrupt handler to make sure the stack TX queue is
	     processed. (FreeBSD r222588)
	   - The maximum read size of incoming packets is done in 1024-byte
	     increments.
	     The current code was rounding down the maximum frame size
	     instead of routing up, resulting in a read size of 1024 bytes,
	     in the non-jumbo frame case, and splitting the packets across
	     multiple mbufs. (FreeBSD r225045)
	   - Consequently the above problem exposed another issue, which is
	     when packets were splitted across multiple mbufs, and all of
	     the mbufs in the chain have the M_PKTHDR flag set.
	     (FreeBSD r225045)
	   - Use the correct constant for conversion between interrupt rate
	     and EITR values (the previous values were off by a factor of 2)
	     (FreeBSD r230572)
	   - Make dev.ix.N.queueM.interrupt_rate a RW sysctl variable. Changing
	     individual values affects the queue immediately, and propagates
	     to all interfaces at the next reinit. (FreeBSD r230572)
	   - Add dev.ix.N.queueM.irqs rdonly sysctl, to export the actual
	     interrupt counts. (FreeBSD r230572)
	   - Some netmap related changes.
	 - Fix a bug that vlan setting may not apply to the parent interface
	   correctly.
	 - Add 82599EN_SFP and 82599_SFP_SF_QP.
	 - Modify to make Intel Intel 10G Ethernet (ixg(4)) virtual function
	   ixv(4) compilable. Not completed yet. It's required to use MSI-X.
	 - Change comments, tabs and spaces to make difference among *BSDs
	   small.
	 - Enclose macro argument correctly. Same as *BSDs. No binary change.
	 - Add missing parenthesis in IXGBE_CORE_LOCK_ASSERT() macro. No binary

	Update LLVM to 3.6.1.

	Disable COMPAT_FREEBSD. The implementation is poor, not well
	tested and almost irrelevant. People who need it (for tw_cli
	for example) can still recompile their kernels with this option.
	[maxv, ticket #814]

	Fix MKDEBUG vs parallel builds.

	[jmcneill, ticket #839]

sys/arch/amiga/include/vmparam.h		1.43

	Remove unused KUSER_AREA, SYSPTSIZE, USRPTSIZE.
	Bump MAXTSIZ and MAXDSIZ to the same values atari is using.
	This makes gcc 4.8 (/usr/libexec/cc1) load and execute.
	[phx, ticket #841]

sbin/gpt/recover.c				1.6

	Instruct user to use resizedisk if media size has changed, as
	resizedisk will adjust the media size in the headers, whereas
	recover simply copies the existing header over the missing one.
	[jnemeth, ticket #847]

usr.bin/calendar/calendar.c			1.51

	Correct privilege handling problems in calendar -a (which runs as root
	from /etc/daily); do not exec other programs while the real uid is
	still 0.

	Also, clear the supplementary groups list up front and call initgroups
	when becoming another user, to avoid leaking any extra group
	privileges that we might have.

	And finally, don't silently ignore errors changing uid and gid; those
	are serious if they happen.
	[dholland, ticket #860]

usr.bin/calendar/calendar.c			1.52

	Repair accidental regression in -r1.49: for -a mode, don't allow
	calendars to be other than regular files unless the -x option is in
	effect.

	(If not in -a mode, we're running purely as the user whose calendar it
	is and if they want to DoS themselves with named pipes it's their own
	lookout.)
	[dholland, ticket #861]

	used for historical reasons.
	[sborrill, ticket #863]

	Add basic support for __HAVE_PREEMPTION.

	Remove the "pending interrupts" code from the kernel if
	possible, which shrinks the kernel about 4KB.

	Add a pic_cpus to the softc which specifies which cpus the pic can
	send IPIs to.  For GIC, initialize pic_cpus to kcpuset_running since
	it can handle all the cpus.

	Adapt pic to deal with the BCM2836 interrupts.
	Move pic_pending_pics, pic_pending_ipls, and pic_blocked_irqs into a
	structure and make then per-cpu.
	There is no global interrupt state anymore.

	RPI2 MP support.

	Use a bit per IPI type in local mailbox 0 registers.

	IPIs should be IPL_HIGH according to rmind@

	Fix bcm2836mp_pic_{un,}block_irqs to handle timer AND mailbox interrupts
	if they're both passed.  Thanks to nat@ for finding this.

	If host's MAXPARTITIONS is larger than a value of the target label and

	(execute shell command) lines to ed.
