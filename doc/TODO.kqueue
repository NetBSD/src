#	$NetBSD: TODO.kqueue,v 1.8.14.1 2013/02/25 00:24:48 tls Exp $

items todo:
	- dir watched - what happens if something is mounted over it?
	  should get write event
	- multiple entry points
	- events should remain across fork()
	- rewrite sowakeup()
	- high-level docco overview of kqueues [c.f jlemon's various papers]
	- make sure there are no selwakeup() calls left (they should
	  all be selnotify() now).
	- kqfilter entry points for:
		- smb_trantcp
		- dev/pci/bktr/bktr_os.c		??? doesn't poll?
	- Test-compile the following ports:
		- amigappc		XXX not compilable even on trunk

merge in from FreeBSD:
	pkgsrc/net/bsdproxy
	lib/libc/net/res_send.c, this has been merged but not turned on
	   I don't think it gains anything performance-wise
	sys/netinet/tcp_subr.c	1.93 (?)
	libc/libc_r/uthread (?)
	pkgsrc/security/l0pht-watch (?)
	sys/fs/fifofs/fifo_vnops.c rev. 1.54
	  - jdolecek: this change seems to be bogus, but perhaps I just
	    miss something?
	usr.bin/make/job.c rev 1.44 - check if it causes any problems
	    on NetBSD (shouldn't)

to fix:

	- look for XXXLUKEM in the comments. these usually indicate
	  areas to either fix or sanity check they're ok (and remove
	  the XXXLUKEM comment)
	- update sys/dev/audio.c:audio_kqfilter() filters for
	  audio_poll() fix in rev. 1.157

not implemented:
	- aio support
		not supported on netbsd; a noop for now

	  EVFILT_AIO	FAIL: not implemented, returns EINVAL
