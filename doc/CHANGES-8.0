	- Fix latency calculation in wm_platform_pm_pch_lpt().
	- Set OBFF water mark and enable OBFF on PCH_LPT and newer.
	- Fix a bug that wm_gmii_i82544_{read,write}reg() didn't take care of
	  page select. PHY access from igphy() automatically did it, but
	  accessing from wm(4) for workaround didn't work correctly. This
	  change affects 8254[17], 8257[12] ICH8, ICH9 and ICH10.
	- Call wm_kmrn_lock_loss_workaround_ich8lan() before any PHY access in
	  wm_linkintr_gmii().
	- Register access in wm_kmrn_lock_loss_workaround_ich8lan() now works
	  correctly. Enable this function.
	- IF TX is not required to flush, RX is also not required to flush in
	  wm_flush_desc_rings(). Same as other OSes.
	- Remove wrong semaphore access in wm_nvm_{read,write}_{ich8,spt} to
	  prevent hangup. A semaphore is get/put in wm_nvm_{read,write}.
	- Move some initialization stuff in wm_attach() before wm_reset().
	  Some flags and callback function is required to set correctly before
	  wm_reset() because wm_reset() and some helper functions refer them.
	- Add wm_write_smbus_addr() to set SMBus address by software.
	- Modify wm_gmii_hv_{read,write}reg_locked() to make them access
	  HV_SMB_ADDR correctly.
	- Configure the LCD with the extended configuration region in NVM if
	  it's required. Tested with Thinkpad X220.
	- 8257[12]: Don't directly access SPI but use EERD register.
	- 82575-I354: If the size of SPI ROM >= 32K words, use direct SPI
	  access instead of EERD register access.
	- Add wm_nvm_eec_clock_raise() and wm_nvm_eec_clock_lower() and use
	  them for Microwire/SPI bus control. Same as Linux and FreeBSD.
	- Reduce timeout value for 80003 in wm_get_swfw_semaphore(). Same as
	  Linux and FreeBSD.
	- Change API of kmrn_{read,write}reg() and check the return value.
	- Check whether it's required to use MDIC workaround for 80003 or not
	  in wm_reset(). If the workaround isn't required, don't use the
	  workaround code in wm_gmii_i80003_{read,write}reg.
	- Add WM_F_WA_I210_CLSEM flag for a workaround. FreeBSD/Linux drivers
	  say "In rare circumstances, the SW semaphore may already be held
	  unintentionally." on I21[01]. PXE boot is one of the case.
	- Qemu's e1000e emulation (82574L)'s SPI has only 64 words. I've never
	  seen on real 82574 hardware with such small SPI ROM. Check
	  NVM word size before accessing higher address words to prevent
	  timeout.
	- Check some wm_nvm_read()'s return vale.
	- Use device_printf() instead of aprint_error_dev() for PHY read/write
	  functions because those are used not only in device attach.
	- Print internal driver flags when attaching.
	- Add debug printf()s.
	- Rename variables.
	- Add comment, update comment and remove wrong comment.

	- Return early in xcall() if the function is sparc_noop() instead of
	  triggering the IPI and then ignoring responses (or lack thereof).

	  and for messages that are already marked as completed.
	[macallan, ticket #429]
