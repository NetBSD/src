	fdc0 at isa? don't have a fdc at all). Because of the 'fdc0 at isa?',
	on systems supporting ACPI the floppy controller would attach as fdc1.
	as fd(4) looks for its type in nvram using the floppy controller index,
	it's looking for the wrong controller and the default density isn't set

sys/arch/prep/pci/pci_machdep.c			1.31

	When we have a non-PReP pci bridge, we need to perform a single swizzle
	on the pin, to get us the right pin on the underlying PReP bridge to
	wire the interrupt to.  Tested with a 4-port fxp card on a 7043-140.
	Thanks to simon for helping me get the math right.

usr.sbin/makefs/cd9660/cd9660_conversion.c	1.4

	PR/36006: Takahiro Kambe: makefs(8) create cd9660 file system with
	wrong time stamp because localtime(3) and gmtime(3) share the same
	buffer. Fixed by using the _r functions.

distrib/utils/sysinst/net.c			1.115

	Fix typo, which prevented DHCP network configuration from discovering
	the machine name.

sys/dev/pci/viaide.c				1.41 via patch

	The VT8237A SATA Controller uses chip_map_7, not 0, tested and
	confirmed working on my machine.  Also when a via controller is set
	to RAID mode, it sets the pci_subclass to raid.  Notice this and set
	ATAC_CAP_RAID.

sys/dev/ata/ata_raid.c				1.22 via patch
sys/dev/ata/ata_raid_via.c			1.1
sys/dev/ata/ata_raidreg.h			1.4 via patch
sys/dev/ata/ata_raidvar.h			1.5 via patch
sys/dev/ata/files.ata				1.15 via patch

	Add support for VIA V-TECH ata raid.  Tested on 4.0 with RAID0, RAID1
	and SPAN over a pair of sata drives on a VT8237A SATA Controller.

sys/compat/linux32/Makefile.inc			1.2

	Fix generated file names from makesyscalls.sh (s/linux/linux32/).
	From Edgar Fu in PR/35956.

sys/compat/linux32/arch/amd64/syscalls.master	1.11

	Add support for a few syscalls:
	setfsuid16/getfsuid16
	setfsuid/getfsuid
	sched_yield
	ok by manu

sys/arch/sparc64/include/ctlreg.h		1.43
sys/arch/sparc64/sparc64/pmap.c			1.188

	When invalidating a context, make sure to flush user windows upfront.
	Do not set the DMMU secondary context to 0 (that would be kernel), and
	add a few required membars after switching the secondary dmmu context.

	This avoids SIRs caused by double kernel_data_faults, caused by spills
	of obsolete user windows after the context for that user pmap is gone.
	[martin, ticket #547]

sys/arch/sparc64/include/ctlreg.h		1.44

	Cleanup last by using a "n"umeric address space identifier.
