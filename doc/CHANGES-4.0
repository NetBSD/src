	on systems supporting ACPI the floppy controller would attach as fdc1.
	as fd(4) looks for its type in nvram using the floppy controller index,
	it's looking for the wrong controller and the default density isn't set

	Preserve local symbols on linking a kernel so that

	Bump SYMTAB_SPACE so that it fits again.

	Use the kernel symbol table to see the beginning of the current
	subroutine to get more proper backtrace on ddb(4).

	In the previous code it scans backwards from the current PC
	for the end of the previous subroutine and checks "jr ra" or
	"jr k0" instructions, but it often fails because gcc is
	so aggressive nowadays as to reorder instruction blocks
	to create efficient code path by branch predict etc. and
	"jr ra" is not always located at the end of subroutines.

sys/dev/vnd.c					patch

	Fix compression problem from Cliff Wright:

	Break one: because b_cylinder, and b_resid are one and the same.
	The work the routine was commented as being its primary function,
	end of patition adjustment, is wiped out, as at the end of
	the routine b_cylinder is set, splat, doing a wipe out of the adjustment
	to b_resid.

	Break two: When doing the adjustment, a block count is created from a
	byte count, a block calculation is done, then the results are compared to
	the original byte count. i.e. apples to oranges, not blocks to blocks,
	but blocks to bytes.

	Break three: since if all the other drivers that used this routine
	would have broken as vnd compress did, I must assume they always ignored
	the results of this routine. So if end of patition adjustment is
	really required then all these other drivers have been broken for a
	long time.

	Pass a frame pointer to trap() rather than the 'entire frame' trick.  Gcc4
	was optimizing away modifications to the frame contents (it's not nice to
	trick gcc).  Pass the pointer as the first argument to reduce the number
	of places that would be changed otherwise.  Fixes the getcwd regression
	test on most m68k ports.

	Fix one more bug I introduced in rev 1.21:
	Clear sc->sc_rx_consumed before allocating RX mbufs by vge_newbuf()
	in vge_intr() otherwise vge_newbuf() might get KASSERT() failure
	on DIAGNOSTIC kernel when the interface is reinitialized during RX.

	yamt's reading of RFC 3720 is correct (see section 12.10, InitialR2T).

	The desired transfer length in the initial ready to transmit

common/lib/libc/arch/arm/string/memcpy_xscale.S	1.2

	Apply the patch, with some minor tweaks, supplied in PR/36513.
	This prevents a possible prefetch past the end of the source buffer.

	Note that the semantics of the pld instruction mean that it is unlikely
	that this would have caused any problems except in very specific
	circumstances in some types of device drivers.
	[scw, ticket #741]

usr.sbin/wsmoused/selection.c			1.10

	Guess the terminal size on each change instead of during program startup.
	This allows the mouse to be used properly in consoles with different sizes:
	before this change it was restricted to the size reported by the console
	used to start the daemon.

	Problem reported by Blair Sadewitz.

	If a quota-enabled file system has 65536 active vnodes for one uid the
	reference counter of the corresponding struct dquot will overflow.

	Change the type of the reference counter from u_int16_t to u_int32_t
	and add an assertion to check for overflow.

	Bump kernel version as LKM's depending on UFS internals will have to be
	recompiled after this change (discussed and approved on tech-kern).

usr.sbin/postinstall/postinstall		1.41, 1.42
usr.sbin/postinstall/postinstall.8		1.7

	Separate postinstall checks in two groups: enabled and disabled by
	default. Only the former checks/fixes are done if no items are given
	on the command line. The latter must be requested explicitely.
	Intended for "fixes" that are dangerous in some way, because they might
	remove files that are still in use, for example.

	Make the "sendmail" item disabled by default, it removes sendmail
	configuration. Partly addresses PR install/36180.
	Proposed on tech-userlevel, review and spelling fixes from lukem@.

	Remove the remaining sendmail config files (including everything in
	/usr/share/sendmail) from the obsolete list. Instead, remove them in the
	"sendmail" postinstall item, which is disabled by default, to prevent
	losing sendmail configuration on upgrade. Fixes the rest of
	PR install/36180.

	Change dk_lookup() to accept an additional argument of the type

	or kernel space, so it can tell NDINIT().

	While the raidframe calls were ok, both ccd(4) and cgd(4) were
	passing pointers to user space data, which leads to strange error
	on i386, as reported by Jukka Salmi on current-users.

	Don't drain a vnode's lock when we are cleaning it out.  It still

	and works around a problem where a lower layer vnode is cleaned

	Import IPFilter 4.1.23

	Initialise the callout before use.

	Fix SIGBUS issues on strict alignment issues. Use le32dec in RMD160
	as the data pointer to RMD160_Update doesn't have to be aligned.

	In SHA256_Update and SHA512_Update, only operate directly on the passed
	in data if no left-over in the context exists and the data is correctly
	aligned. The problem was exposed by the audit-packages rewrite in C
	and reported for the libnbcompat version in PR pkg/36662.
	cast to void* to avoid a fatal warning

	Add 'service level' security for L2CAP and RFCOMM connections, following
	the Linux (BlueZ) API.
	- L2CAP or RFCOMM connections can require the baseband radio link
  	  mode be any of:
		authenticated (devices are paired)
		encrypted (implies authentication)
		secured (encryption, plus generate new link key)
	- for sockets, the mode is set using setsockopt(2) and the socket
	  connection will be aborted if the mode change fails.
	- mode settings will be applied during connection establishment, and
	  for safety, we enter a wait state and will only proceed when the mode
	  settings are successfuly set.
	- It is possible to change the mode on already open connections, but
	  not possible to guarantee that data already queued (from either end)
	  will not be delivered. (this is a feature, not a bug)
	- bthidev(4) and rfcomm_sppd(1) support "auth", "encrypt" and
	  "secure" options
	- btdevctl(8) by default enables "auth" for HIDs, and "encrypt" for
	  keyboards (which are required to support it)
	- ALSO INCLUDES OTHER MINOR FIXES
	[plunky, ticket #744]

tools/compat/sys/null.h				1.1

sys/dist/ipf/netinet/fil.c			1.39
sys/dist/ipf/netinet/ip_fil.h			1.14

	Avoid casting to "i6addr_t *", because that type requires 64-bit
	alignment and nothing guarantees that IPv6 packets in mbufs are 8-byte
	aligned.  gcc was coalescing adjacent 32-bit compares into "ldx" on
	sparc64, leading to alignment faults when processing icmp6 arriving on
	gif with IPv4 outer addresses.

	Fix mostly from darrenr@.  Discussed extensively on port-sparc64.
	[gdt, ticket #779]

sys/dev/pci/machfb.c				patch

	This keeps machfb from matching Rage Mobility chips which we don't

	[macallan, ticket #781]

sys/arch/sun3/sun3x/locore.s			1.56

	Sync with sun3/locore.s rev 1.88:
	Pass a frame pointer to trap() rather than the 'entire frame' trick.  Gcc4
	was optimizing away modifications to the frame contents (it's not nice to
	trick gcc).  Pass the pointer as the first argument to reduce the number
	of places that would be changed otherwise.  Fixes the getcwd regression
	test on most m68k ports.
	Fixes MMU fault panic in trap() on sun3x.

	This should be pulled up to netbsd-4 too.

	Don't allow getcwd() on procfs vnodes and provide "/" as the path
	instead of the result from getcwd().  The works around locking
	panics caused by namei calling VOP_READLINK while holding on to a
	directory lock and getcwd() trying to acquire that lock.  The real
	fix would be to get rid of getcwd() calls within VOPs (not locking
	safe), but that's not a viable option in the netbsd-4 timeframe.

	Suggestion for workaround from David Holland.

sys/fs/tmpfs/tmpfs_vnops.c			1.39

	Add test cases to ensure that:
	1) Renaming a directory to an empty directory works by replacing
	the target directory.
	2) Renaming a directory to a non-empty directory fails.
	This is all by calling rename(2) directly, not mv(1).
	tmpfs currently fails those tests, raising an assertion if
	DIAGNOSTIC is
	enabled.  A fix will hopefully follow soon.
	Found by pooka@.

	Add some more tests to ensure that renaming a file to a directory
	and a directory to a file fails with the appropriate error codes.
	tmpfs still fails these tests, but the fix is almost ready to go in.

	Multiple fixes for tmpfs' rename operation:
	- Raise an error if renaming a file to a directory.
	- Raise an error if renaming a directory to a file.
	- Raise an error if renaming a directory to a non-empty directory.
	- Properly allow renaming a directory to an empty directory.
	The system could previously crash if the kernel had DIAGNOSTIC
	enabled as this triggered a bogus assertion.
	Problem found by Geoff Wing.

lib/libutil/sockaddr_snprintf.c			1.8

	In sockaddr_snprintf(sbuf, len, fmt, sa), do not write the terminating
	null character outside of the byte region [sbuf, sbuf + len).

	1) If the length of the buffer is 0, do not write a null character
   	at all.  Previously, sockaddr_snprintf() may have been able to
   	overwrite sbuf[-1] if len was 0.

	2) If the length of the buffer, len, is greater than 0, then write
   	the null at sbuf[len - 1].  Previously, sockaddr_snprintf()
   	wrote the null at buf[len - 1], where `buf' was a "cursor" that
   	did not necessarily equal `sbuf', the start of the buffer.  Now,
   	sockaddr_snprintf() always writes the null at sbuf[len - 1].

	#Define PCI_PMCSR_PME_EN

	Name magic numbers PCI_PMCSR_PME_EN and PCI_PMCSR.

	Fix grammar in comment.  From Patrick Welche.

	Use the right subroutine name for the debug message.

	Convert the rather long and backslash-ridden DELAY_MS macro to a
	much shorter static subroutine, delay_ms().

	Cosmetic: KNF indentation, curly braces, and argument declarations.

	sc_pwrcycle is shared between the interrupt handler and Cardbus
	event thread, so make it volatile.

	Fix a bug in Cardbus power activation.

	Most Cardbus bridges supported by pccbb(4) fire a power-cycle
	interrupt when the power state of a cardslot changes from 'off' to
	'on'.  TI bridges fire a power-cycle interrupt on both on->off and
	off->on changes.

	When pccbb_power() powered-down a cardslot, it did not wait around
	for the power-cycle interrupt.  When pccbb_power() powered-up a
	cardslot, it did wait for the interrupt.  If a pccbb_power(UP)
	followed a pccbb_power(DOWN) very closely, pccbb_power() used to
	interpret the power-cycle interrupt for the up->down transition as
	"power-up complete," read the power-state bit and, finding that
	power had NOT been activated, complain, "cbb0:  power on failed?"
	Then pccbb_power() exited before power-activation was complete,
	falsely indicating that the power-activation *was* complete.  After
	that, a driver attach/enable routine would blithely configure a
	card that was not fully powered-up.  An operator who ran a command
	such as 'ifconfig rtw0 down up' or 'ifconfig ath0 down up' would
	read 'cbb0: power on failed?' in the system log, and their NIC
	would misbehave.

	This excerpt from a comment in the source should suffice to explain
	how I fixed the bug,

	/*
	 * Wait as long as 200ms for a power-cycle interrupt.  If
	 * interrupts are enabled, but the socket has already
	 * changed to the desired status, keep waiting for the
	 * interrupt.  "Consuming" the interrupt in this way keeps
	 * the interrupt from prematurely waking some subsequent
	 * pccbb_power call.

	And this explains why this patch will work for Ricoh bridges that
	do not fire an interrupt on the on->off transition:

	 * XXX Not every bridge interrupts on the ->OFF transition.
	 * XXX That's ok, we will time-out after 200ms.
	 *
	 * XXX The power cycle event will never happen when attaching
	 * XXX a 16-bit card.  That's ok, we will time-out after
	 * XXX 200ms.
	 */

	M. Warner Losh and Charles M. Hannum provided valuable input on
	this patch.

	Define a new lockmgr flag LK_RESURRECT which can be used in
	conjunction with LK_DRAIN.  This has the same effect as LK_DRAIN
	except it atomically does NOT mark the lock as drained.  This
	guarantees that when we got the lock, we were the last one currently
	waiting for the lock.

	Use LK_DRAIN|LK_RESURRECT in vclean() to make sure there are no
	waiters for the lock.  This should fix behaviour theoretized to be
	caused by vfs_subr.c 1.289 which caused vclean() to run into
	completion and free the vnode before all lock-waiters had been
	processed.  Should therefore fix the "simple_lock: unitialized lock"
	problems seen recently.

	thanks to Juergen Hannken-Illjes for some analysis of the problem
	and Erik Bertelsen for testing

sys/arch/shark/isa/clock.c			1.15
sys/arch/shark/isa/isa_irq.S			1.8

	Make clockintr() return 1 since it's always handled so that
	clock interrupt is properly acounted by evcnt(9) in isa_irq.S.

	In irq_setmasks(), refer spl_masks[current_spl_level] directly
	rather than spl_mask which is a saved value in splraise() and
	splx() functions because the latter one is not always sync'ed with
	current_spl_level and interrupt state could be mangled.

	Okay'ed by chris@, and should close PR port-shark/22355.

	68030 and 68040 processors consider the read portion of a
	read-modify-write transfer as a write to ensure the memory is writable
	before starting any transfer.  The fault status information does not
	reflect this in the 'read' status bit (i.e. it shows up as a read
	access), so faults with a RMW access to non-writable memory was not
	getting the correct protection.  The page would be read-only and the
	instruction would fault over and over.

	A specific example is when a process forks, and the child process
	attempts to execute a RMW access to a data page, which is read-only
	because it's CoP Copy-On-Write.

	When checking if the page needs to be writablek, also check the locked
	transfer and treat any locked transfer as a write.

	68060 already handled this correctly, since it has separate read and
	write fault bits, and both are set on a RMW access and the trap code
	was checking the write status bit.

	Fixes PR#36848.

	If running on a hypervisor that doesn't support GNTTABOP_query_size,
	fall back to a 4-pages grant table, so this change is backward-compatible.

sys/dev/ic/ahcisata_core.c			1.5
sys/dev/ic/ahcisatareg.h			1.2

	Fix various error handling bugs:
	 - the value of the ATA error register would be computed
	   wrongly, leading to bogus error values reported to wd(4).
	 - the channel would not always be restarted after an error,
	   so the next command would not be hanlded by the controller.
	 - a timeout condition would not be properly reported to wd(4),
	   leading to a short transfer instead of a reset/retry.

	these bugs would cause a AHCI SATA channel to be stalled (no more
	command processed) after a "ID not found" or "Aborted command" error
	reported by the drive.

	Consider '\r' to be white space. Discussed with and also kept as local
	change by freza. With this change, DOS style line endings work.

	boolean_t -> bool
	TRUE -> true
	FALSE -> false

	libprop is currently using a recursive parser. While this is fine for
	userland, deeply nested arrays and dictionaries can easily overflow
	the kernel stack and thereby force a panic.

	Fix the internalizer and prop_object_release to use a separate call
	stack and alter the dictionary and array handling to not recurse on
	the C stack. The default stack has an inline depth of 16 elements,
	which should keep the overhead reasonable.

	This issue was found by Pavel Cahyna and Jachym Holecek.

	Additionally add a limit for prop_object_copyin_ioctl to prevent user
	programs from temporary allocating unbound amount of kernel memory.
	Allow malloc to fail so that tight loops of userland processes can't
	force panics by exhausting the kernel map.

	Tested with the sample exploit of Jachym, his test suite and reviewed
	by himself (initial patch), Christos Zoulas and Jason Thorpe.

	struct plistref does not reference other proplib data types, so split it
	in its own header file to be included by dkio.h. Fixes breakage due to
	pollution from proplib.h in programs which include ioctl.h. Tested and OK
	by dogcow@.

	Attempt at fixing build failures after proplib was converted to bool:
	FALSE -> false, TRUE -> true, boolean_t -> bool, int -> bool when
	appropriate, include stdbool.h . proplib.h no longer provides boolean_t,
	so it is necessary to change to bool.

	From Tom Spindler (dogcow@).

	Avoid using unbound amount of stack frames in prop_object_equal
	by using a dynamic stack as well. Reorder arguments for the internalizer
	as the iteration is always present and should go before possibly
	NULL arguments.

	Reviewed by mjf@ and adrianp@

	- Return exit code 1 when a postinstall check or fix fails.
	- Ignore the return code from "postinstall check" during make build, it
  	  typically fails.
	- Add a check for obsolete sendmail in /etc/mailer.conf, installs a

sys/dev/pci/pccbb.c				1.150

	Remove a completely bogus check if cbb has a valid PCI interrupt routed.
	If you have a system where it doesn't get one and you still want pcic,
	you can just disable cbb. This check is invalid as soon as the PCI
	interrupt register is not used and broke on my Dell Latitude for that
	reason.

	Fix problem where targets with ID 0, 1, or 2 couldn't be reconnected.

	It seems I have always tested with targets those ID >= 3,
	and that I am the only user of this driver.

	- Reset the bus if a Bus Reset condition is detected to make sure
  	  all devices on the bus are really reset.

	- Block interrupts on Bus Reset, and check it periodically until the
	  reset is released.  On some 32UDE devices (probably the earlier ones)
	  the RST line looks unstable without the termination power and may
	  suffer ~continuous Bus Reset interrupts.

	- Change number of scatter/gather segments from 16 to 17, to allow
	  non-page-aligned 64KB transfer on 4KB/page platforms.
