If you are receiving this distribution on a CD set, some files and
subdirectories may be on a separate disc; read all README files for more
information.

See http://www.NetBSD.org/about/crypto-export.html for the formal status of
the exportability out of the United States of some pieces of the
distribution tree containing cryptographic software.  If you export these
bits and the above document says you should not do so, it's your fault,
not ours.
