A complete list of changes from the NetBSD 2.1 release to the NetBSD 2.2 
release

File						Revision(s)
----						--------
sys/sys/param.h                                 patch
share/tmac/doc-common                           patch
gnu/usr.bin/groff/tmac/mdoc.local               patch

	Welcome to 2.1_STABLE

doc/LAST_MINUTE					patch

	Null out in preparation for 2.2

gnu/libexec/uucp/doc/uucp.texi			1.6
gnu/libexec/uucp/libunix/pipe.c			1.3

	Allow for \H -> "address ..." substitution in PIPE ports. Useful
	e.g. for generic UUCP over SSH or SSL... Idea and part of the patch
	by Joerg Durchain, has apparently been integrated in Debian for a
	while.
	[is, ticket #5825]

sys/dev/raidframe/rf_dagdegwr.c			1.26

	Remove an RF_ASSERT that is just plain wrong.
	[oster, ticket #5878]

doc/README.files				patch

	Note new CHANGES file and fix XXX's for release numbers.

sys/nfs/nfs.h					1.49
sys/nfs/nfs_subs.c				1.152 via patch
sys/nfs/nfs_vfsops.c				1.149 via patch
sys/nfs/nfs_vnops.c				1.227 via patch
sys/nfs/nfsmount.h				1.34
usr.sbin/amd/include/config.h			1.36

	Allow the attribute cache to be turned off, and allow amd
	to do it.
	[christos, ticket #5863]

sys/arch/alpha/conf/GENERIC			1.276

	If we're enabling ipfilter then we should really have IPFILTER_LOG
	[abs, ticket #5893]

sys/dev/ic/wdc.c				patch

	In __wdccommand_start(), don't cann wdcwait() with ata_c->flags, as 
	this gives  information about the context in which wdc_exec_command() 
	was called, but we may be in interrupt context here. Call wdcwait() 
	with flags derived from xfer->c_flags instead, as do other wdcwait() 
	callers. PR#31083
	[bouyer, ticket #5852]

include/sched.h					1.8
lib/libpthread/sched.c				1.4

	Change the sched_*() functions to return -1 and set errno to ENOSYS
	(per the standard) instead of returning ENOSYS. PR#30970
	[kleink, ticket #5918]

usr.sbin/rpc.statd/statd.c			1.24

	rpc.statd doesn't save failed notifies in the database. PR#31502
	[christos, ticket #5934]

share/misc/airport				1.26

	Correct typo in the airport file.
	[is, ticket #5937]

sys/kern/uipc_socket.c				1.112

	Check the argument to SO_LINGER.
	[nathanw, ticket #5939]

sys/dev/ic/elinkxl.c				1.85

	The previous change (to use bus_space_read_2), was broken because it was
	reading from an odd offset.
	[christos, ticket #5942]

sys/netinet6/icmp6.c				1.111

	In icmp6_redirect_output(), sip6 is initialised to point to the
	data area of m0. But m0 may be freed later, so trying to use
	sip6 at the end of this function is wrong. My guess is that
	we want to reference the data area of m (the mbuf about to be
	send) instead at this point.  Fix a panic on Xen (where a data
	area of a mbuf may be unmapped when the mbuf is freed), and
	probably potential data/pool corruption in other cases.
	[bouyer, ticket #5938]

share/man/man4/fast_ipsec.4			1.2-1.3

	Fix Dd argument; new sentence, new line; sort sections;
	typo fixes.
	[jmc, ticket #5946]

distrib/sets/lists/base/md.ibmnws		delete
distrib/sets/lists/base/mi			1.576
distrib/sets/lists/man/md.ibmnws		delete
distrib/sets/lists/man/mi			1.835 via patch
gnu/usr.sbin/Makefile				1.14

	Build ncdcs on everything. Allows better set sharing (and
	we don't exclude other 'system specific' binaries from other
	builds ala sunlabel, etc), and nuke only md man page in existence,
	simplifying man.tgz set sharing.
	[jmc, ticket #5948]

sys/arch/sparc/sparc/cpu.c			1.193

	Compute c_totalsize for split caches correctly: it's max, not sum (and
	we even have that documented in cache.h).  Initialize c_nlines for
	split caches.
	This should fix srmmu cache flush routines for split I/D caches that
	has been broken since cache.c revision 1.79 started using c_nlines.
	[uwe, ticket #5950]

sys/kern/kern_exec.c				patch

	Don't clear unconditionally P_SUGID when we exec. Clear it only when
	the real and effective user and group ids match.
	[dan, ticket #5955]

dist/ntp/ntpd/ntpd.c				1.8

	Use group-id from ``gr'' and not ``pw''.
	Fixes security issue addressed by CAN-2005-2496.
	[dan, ticket #5958]

sys/dev/scsipi/scsipi_ioctl.c			1.54

	Don't claim there is a data in or out phase if the datalen is 0
	(userland shouldn't claim it either, but a buggy software shouldn't
	be able to crash the kernel anyway). Should fix port-sparc64/31925
	by Johan A.van Zanten (which should really be kern/31925).
	Analysed and patch tested by Martin Husemann.
	[bouyer, ticket #5961]

distrib/utils/sysinst/util.c			1.137

	Don't redisplay the title messages before displaying sub-menus
	during set selection (eg selecting the X sets).
	libcurses got changed earlier in the year so that the erase (and
	refresh) of the message window caused all the unchanged spaces
	to be redrawn overwriting most of the main set selection window.
	[dsl, ticket #5964]

sys/uvm/uvm_glue.c				1.90

	Remove the assertion in uvm_swapout_threads() about LSONPROC lwps
	not running on the same CPU as the swapper.  l_stat is protected by
	sched_lock, which isn't held here, so we can race with that lwp
	starting to run and see its l_cpu not updated yet, as in PR 31870.
	we check l_stat again in uvm_swapout() while holding sched_lock,
	so the race itself is harmless.
	[bouyer, ticket #5965]

usr.sbin/rpc.statd/stat_proc.c			1.7

	When forking, we keep a reference to the status db file, and if the
	memory copy of the file is dirty, is will be synced when the child
	exists.  But the parent may have done changes to the database in
	the meantime, resulting in a db corruption.
	Fix this by calling sync_file() just before the fork. The child
	will still have a reference to the db, but won't try to write it
	on exit.
	[bouyer, ticket #5967]

sys/dev/sbus/be.c				1.46

	ETHERCAP_VLAN_MTU is a flag for ec_capabilities, the size of the 802.1q
	encaptulation header is ETHER_VLAN_ENCAP_LEN. Pointed out by der Mouse
	on tech-kern.
	[bouyer, ticket #5968]

lib/libkvm/kvm_x86_64.c				1.5

	Fix parsing the page tables.
	[chs, ticket #5969]

sbin/newfs/mkfs.c				1.92

	don't set fs_maxsymlinklen and fs_old_inodefmt twice,
	we set them correctly the first time.  fixes PR 26995.
	[chs, ticket #5971]

sys/fs/msdosfs/denode.h				1.10
sys/fs/msdosfs/msdosfs_vnops.c			1.22

	PR/32003: Brian Buhrow: msdosfs doesn't properly zero out high
	cluster data on non-FAT32 msdos filesystems.
	[christos, ticket #5972]

usr.bin/cap_mkdb/cap_mkdb.c			1.21-1.22

	Write the database file into a temporary file first, because
	otherwise if we don't specify an output filename, the database file
	we create will end up being used during population as the database
	file to find entries quickly.
	[christos, ticket #5978]

sys/kern/vfs_vnops.c				1.99

	vput() -> vrele(). Vnode is already unlocked.
	With much help from Pavel Cahyna.  PR#32005
	[hannken, ticket #5983]

sys/dev/usb/ulpt.c				1.70 via patch

	Fix a long standing typo noticed by Alex Pivovarov on PR/32061.
	When people use variables like 'flag' and 'flags' in the same function
	(one local and one passed as a parameter) this is prone to happen..
	[rpaulo, ticket #5988]

sys/miscfs/kernfs/kernfs_vnops.c		1.114 via patch

	Fix 64 bit truncation problem allowing to read arbitrary kernel memory.
	[christos, ticket #10155]

	New Dell Day, continued:  add support for the fxp(4) variant in the
	802801G* family of SB.
	[cube, ticket #5990]

sys/nfs/nfs_bio.c				1.136-1.137 via patch

	The problem (kern/31926): under certain conditions, which could be
	reliably reproduced, NFS reads would occasionally return zeroes instead
	of some of the file data, or fail with EINVAL.
	[jld, ticket #8826]

include/ieeefp.h				1.7 via patch

PR/32108: Greg Oster: fpgetmask() linking failure with g++ on macppc
Missing __{BEGIN,END}_DECLS.
[oster, ticket #8833]

sys/dev/ic/an.c					1.33 via patch
sys/dev/ic/anvar.h				1.9 via patch

	Fix two bugs: frames were bogusly discarded with the complaint
	"oversize frame."  Also, some an(4) instances (esp. w/ firmware
	version 5+) would not reliably interoperate with some Cisco APs.
	Thanks to Jim Miller for his valuable bug reports and testing, and
	to Dheeraj Reddy for RID-length patches.
	[jnemeth, ticket #10159]

sys/arch/sgimips/stand/sgivol/sgivol.c		1.10

	0 is a success code for ioctl().  Fixes install problem introduced by
	revision 1.9 last November.
	[tsutsui, ticket #10164]

sys/dev/microcode/siop/siop.ss			1.20 via patch
sys/dev/microcode/siop/siop.out			regen

	Some drives disconnect after the last data phase without a save
	data pointer message. In such case we would not update resid with
	the proper value (eventually resid would not be updated at all if
	there was only one data phase). To fix this, have the script save
	the offset in the data tables at disconnect time if there was a
	transfer, and use this to compute the resid if the current offset
	is 0.  Problem reported and patch tested by edwin, Roy Bixler and
	YAMAMOTO Takashi.  Fix kern/31990 by YAMAMOTO Takashi.
	[bouyer, ticket #10168]

sys/dev/pci/if_bgereg.h				1.29

	Remove unnecessary byteswap code so that bge(4) should work
	at least on macppc.
	[tsutsui, ticket #10169]

sys/dev/pci/if_sk.c                             1.17

	Fix occasional "sk0: watchdog timeout" from the on-board ethernet on
	an Asus A8V motherboard.
	[riz, ticket #10154]

sys/dev/pci/if_re.c				patch
sys/dev/pci/if_sk.c				1.18 via patch

	Special-case the Linksys EG1032 cards using PCI subsystem ID;
	rev. 2 uses the sk(4) driver, while rev. 3 needs re(4).
	[riz, ticket #10156]

sys/dev/pci/if_re.c				patch

	Avoid time wrap when setting the system time.
	[christos, ticket #10184]

sys/kern/kern_time.c				patch

	Avoid time wrap when setting the system time.
	[christos, ticket #10184]

sys/dev/usb/usb_subr.c				1.130

	usbd_setup_pipe(): Don't call usbd_clear_endpoint_stall(). It's not
	necessary for normal devices, and it prevents some common (but
	apparantly buggy) devices from working, including the Apple iPod (mini
	and photo) and certain M-Systems DiskOnKey flash devices.
	If (also buggy) devices resurface that need this when they are
	attached, they can be addressed, ideally in each device's driver.
	[riz, ticket #10181]

build.sh					patch

	Clean up environment to avoid side effects on builds.
	[jmc, ticket #10194]

usr.sbin/rpc.statd/statd.c			1.25

        We can't call db->put() with key or data pointing back to db(3)'s memory
	space, or the database will be corrupted (noticed when the database is
	updated in reset_host()). Change change_host() to copy hostname and 
	HostInfo to local storage before calling db->put().
	Change notify_one() to use change_host() instead of calling db->put()
	directly. 
        [bouyer, ticket #10171]

usr.bin/gzip/gzip.c				1.78-180
usr.bin/gzip/unbzip2.c				1.9
usr.bin/gzip/zuncompress.c			1.6

	Fix a few issues:
	  gzip -vt just prints the contents of a .Z file
	  gzip -vt will print OK even if the .gz file is corrupt
	  gzip -vt prints nothing with a .bz2 file
	  gzip can loop endlessly with a corrupt .bz2 file
	  Don't warn about >4GB files not having their size correctly stored.

sys/arch/cobalt/dev/com_mainbus.c		1.9
sys/arch/cobalt/dev/com_mainbusvar.h		1.1

	Cobalt kernel hangs in the second
	consinit() call if it is loaded by the native bootloader,
	so there is no bootstrap way to install other than to use
	an older kernel.

	[tsutsui, ticket #10175]

sys/arch/cobalt/conf/INSTALL			patch
etc/etc.cobalt/Makefile.inc			1.2

	The cobalt firmware has a size restriction on loading kernel.
	so we should also have a smaller kernel binary for bootstrap install.  

	[tsutsui, ticket #10176]

xsrc/xfree/xc/programs/xdm/config/Imakefile	1.6

	Don't call alloc_scb() (which can call bus_dmamem_alloc/map) from
	ADAPTER_REQ_RUN_XFER context (which can be interrupt context), defer 
	this to the ADAPTER_REQ_GROW_RESOURCES callback. Fixes a panic in uvm.
	[bouyer, ticket #10177]

sys/kern/kern_sig.c				1.211

	in kpsignal2(), do not try to wake up a cached LWP for SA processes
	in the case where we're sending SIGKILL but all LWPs are not signalable.
	some LWP will wake up soon enough to process the signal, and there may
	not be any LWPs in the cache to wake up anyway.  fixes PR 28886 and
	PR 26771.  also, add a missing "break" pointed out by yamt.
	[chs, ticket #10206]

sys/kern/vfs_subr.c				1.231

	Fix an annoying deadlock involving 3 separate processes.
	[chs, ticket #10207]

sys/dev/pci/pciide_common.c			1.29 via patch

	Fix forcing use of DMA mode for the generic pciide driver:
	default_chip_map() is called from pciide_attach() and at
	this point we don't know which drives are here. Just assume
	all drives are there and allocate DMA ressources for all of them.
	[bouyer, ticket #10212]

sys/fs/union/union_vfsops.c			1.32 via patch

	Change union_unmount() to not play with the fs root vnode explicitly.
	Let it get recycled along with all of the others. This is important
	as if the root vnode has already been reclaimed, then we get a panic
	when we try to vget it.  This addresses PR: kern/31382
