	[hira, ticket #538]

sys/dev/ic/hme.c				1.69, 1.70, 1.73
sys/dev/ic/gem.c				1.83

	hme.c rev 1.69: tcp4csum-rx and udp4csum is not enabled
	properly due to lack of "else" statement.
	hme.c rev 1.70: local ether_cmp() funcion has a wrong return
	value, so multicast is not set properly.
	hme.c rev 1.71, gem.c rev 1.83: These chips are configured to
	calculate RX packet checksum from offset ETHER_HDR_LEN +
	sizeof(struct ip), so if RX packets has IP options headers the
	drivers have to deduct the sum of the IP options header part.
	But there is a bug in the deduction calculation, so if
	tcp4csum-rx or udp4csum-rx are enabled all RX TCP/UDP packets
	with IP option headers will be discarded.
	[tsutsui, ticket #595]

sys/dev/ic/rtl8169.c				1.109-1.113

	[tsutsui, ticket #597]

sys/dev/raidframe/rf_dagfuncs.c			1.30
sys/dev/raidframe/rf_diskqueue.c		1.52
sys/dev/raidframe/rf_diskqueue.h		1.23

	Rework/simplify the disk queuing code.  A bunch of this was
	still holdovers from the simulator and would never be seen/used
	in-kernel.
	[oster, ticket #607]

sys/kern/sys_module.c				1.9

	copyin the modctl_load_t for the non-x86 world. Fixes PR/41294.
	[skrll, ticket #729]

lib/libc/net/getifaddrs.3			1.10
lib/libc/net/getifaddrs.c			1.12
sbin/ifconfig/af_link.c				1.4 - 1.6
sbin/ifconfig/ifconfig.c			1.216 - 1.218
sbin/ifconfig/util.c				1.10, 1.11
sbin/ifconfig/util.h				1.7

	address in the 'address: ' field
	For non-AF_LINK ifaddrs, ifa_data is NULL.  AFAICT, this has always
	been so.  Say so in the documentation.
	Bring getifaddrs(3) behavior in line with the documentation: the
	ifa_data member of every AF_LINK struct ifaddrs points at the
	corresponding struct if_data.  In ifconfig(8), do not try to suppress
	duplicate AF_LINK ifaddrs by checking for a NULL ifa_data.
	Don't copy out two AF_LINK struct ifaddrs for each active link-layer
	address. getifaddrs(3) used to copy out one ifaddrs for the kernel's
	RTM_IFINFO message, and one more for the kernel's RTM_NEWADDR message.
	I suppress the first duplicate with a highly conservative change that
	wastes a little bit of ifaddrs storage.  The storage is not leaked.
	[dyoung, ticket #730]

sys/kern/uipc_socket.c				1.189

	PR kern/41311: Mutex error: mutex_vector_enter: locking against myself
	[ad, ticket #731]

sys/kern/vfs_dirhash.c				1.10

	port-vax/41315: fix off by one error
	Previous code ususally works since compiler won't put gap between
	those struct members but there is no reason to rely on that.
	[martin, ticket #732]

sys/opencrypto/xform.c				1.18
sys/opencrypto/xform.h				1.10

	Extend the Opencrypto API to allow the destination buffer
	size to be specified when it is not the same size as the input
	buffer (i.e., for operations like compress and decompress).
	The crypto_op and crypt_n_op structures gain a u_int dst_len
	field.  The session_op structure gains a comp_alg field to
	specify a compression algorithm.
	Moved four ioctls to new ids; CIOCGSESSION, CIOCNGSESSION,
	CIOCCRYPT, and CIOCNCRYPTM.  Added four backward compatible
	ioctls; OCIOCGSESSION, OCIOCNGSESSION, OCIOCCRYPT, and
	OCIOCNCRYPTM.
	Backward compatibility is maintained in ocryptodev.h and
	ocryptodev.c which implement the original ioctls and set
	dst_len and comp_alg to 0.
	Add user-space access to compression features.
	Add software gzip support (CRYPTO_GZIP_COMP).
	Add the fast version of crc32 from zlib to libkern. This should
	be generally useful and provide a place to start normalizing
	the various crc32 routines in the kernel.  The crc32 routine is
	used in this patch to support GZIP.
	Fixes PR kern/41069 and PR kern/41070.

        On i82563, the em driver says that the ready bit in the MDIC
        register may be incorrectly set. Insert delay(200) like the

        Examine the management mode and mark DRV_LOAD (for
        ICH{8,9,10},80003, 8257{1,2,3,4}).  Add some error printf()s.

	[msaitoh, ticket #630]

sys/net/if_vlan.c				1.63

	Also inherit the parent's TCP segmentation offload capability.

	off in the parent it will remain on in the vlan interface.

usr.bin/paste/paste.c				1.15

	Null-terminate the delimiter list string after processing escapes

	When preparing the initial trap frame for a new forked lwp,

	(handlers are inherited from the parent) before we ever return to

	after the signal handler returns, the lwp stays in userland and
	directly uses the ucontext to return to the fork call.

	Fix alternating oddity in RMW strategy. Even when in the reading
	state it would push out elements to fillup-read only when the
	time had come for them.  This could then trickle feed the read
	queue slowly, but fast enough to prevent it from switching state.

	  - Add special case code to fix a problem with the BCM5704 in TBI
	    mode
	  - Force an interrupt in bge_ifmedia_upd
	  - Add missing workaround for 5705
         - Don't print error message only when the register is BGE_SRS_MODE.
