sys/dev/ic/hme.c				1.69, 1.70, 1.73
sys/dev/ic/gem.c				1.83

	hme.c rev 1.69: tcp4csum-rx and udp4csum is not enabled
	properly due to lack of "else" statement.
	hme.c rev 1.70: local ether_cmp() funcion has a wrong return
	value, so multicast is not set properly.
	hme.c rev 1.71, gem.c rev 1.83: These chips are configured to
	calculate RX packet checksum from offset ETHER_HDR_LEN +
	sizeof(struct ip), so if RX packets has IP options headers the
	drivers have to deduct the sum of the IP options header part.
	But there is a bug in the deduction calculation, so if
	tcp4csum-rx or udp4csum-rx are enabled all RX TCP/UDP packets
	with IP option headers will be discarded.
	[tsutsui, ticket #595]

sys/dev/raidframe/rf_dagfuncs.c			1.30
sys/dev/raidframe/rf_diskqueue.c		1.52
sys/dev/raidframe/rf_diskqueue.h		1.23

	Rework/simplify the disk queuing code.  A bunch of this was
	still holdovers from the simulator and would never be seen/used
	in-kernel.
	[oster, ticket #607]

sys/kern/sys_module.c				1.9

	copyin the modctl_load_t for the non-x86 world. Fixes PR/41294.
	[skrll, ticket #729]

lib/libc/net/getifaddrs.3			1.10
lib/libc/net/getifaddrs.c			1.12
sbin/ifconfig/af_link.c				1.4 - 1.6
sbin/ifconfig/ifconfig.c			1.216 - 1.218
sbin/ifconfig/util.c				1.10, 1.11
sbin/ifconfig/util.h				1.7

	address in the 'address: ' field
	For non-AF_LINK ifaddrs, ifa_data is NULL.  AFAICT, this has always
	been so.  Say so in the documentation.
	Bring getifaddrs(3) behavior in line with the documentation: the
	ifa_data member of every AF_LINK struct ifaddrs points at the
	corresponding struct if_data.  In ifconfig(8), do not try to suppress
	duplicate AF_LINK ifaddrs by checking for a NULL ifa_data.
	Don't copy out two AF_LINK struct ifaddrs for each active link-layer
	address. getifaddrs(3) used to copy out one ifaddrs for the kernel's
	RTM_IFINFO message, and one more for the kernel's RTM_NEWADDR message.
	I suppress the first duplicate with a highly conservative change that
	wastes a little bit of ifaddrs storage.  The storage is not leaked.
	[dyoung, ticket #730]

sys/kern/uipc_socket.c				1.189

	PR kern/41311: Mutex error: mutex_vector_enter: locking against myself
	[ad, ticket #731]

sys/kern/vfs_dirhash.c				1.10

	port-vax/41315: fix off by one error
	Previous code ususally works since compiler won't put gap between
	those struct members but there is no reason to rely on that.

sys/opencrypto/xform.h				1.10

	Extend the Opencrypto API to allow the destination buffer
	size to be specified when it is not the same size as the input
	buffer (i.e., for operations like compress and decompress).
	The crypto_op and crypt_n_op structures gain a u_int dst_len
	field.  The session_op structure gains a comp_alg field to
	specify a compression algorithm.
	Moved four ioctls to new ids; CIOCGSESSION, CIOCNGSESSION,
	CIOCCRYPT, and CIOCNCRYPTM.  Added four backward compatible
	ioctls; OCIOCGSESSION, OCIOCNGSESSION, OCIOCCRYPT, and
	OCIOCNCRYPTM.
	Backward compatibility is maintained in ocryptodev.h and
	ocryptodev.c which implement the original ioctls and set
	dst_len and comp_alg to 0.
	Add user-space access to compression features.
	Add software gzip support (CRYPTO_GZIP_COMP).
	Add the fast version of crc32 from zlib to libkern. This should
	be generally useful and provide a place to start normalizing
	the various crc32 routines in the kernel.  The crc32 routine is
	used in this patch to support GZIP.
	Fixes PR kern/41069 and PR kern/41070.

        On i82563, the em driver says that the ready bit in the MDIC
        register may be incorrectly set. Insert delay(200) like the

        Examine the management mode and mark DRV_LOAD (for
        ICH{8,9,10},80003, 8257{1,2,3,4}).  Add some error printf()s.

usr.bin/paste/paste.c				1.15

	Null-terminate the delimiter list string after processing escapes

	When preparing the initial trap frame for a new forked lwp,

	(handlers are inherited from the parent) before we ever return to

	after the signal handler returns, the lwp stays in userland and
	directly uses the ucontext to return to the fork call.

sys/dev/pci/pci_usrreq.c			1.20-1.22 via patch

	Fix various mmap() operations used by libpciaccess.
	[mrg, ticket #952]

sys/arch/x86/x86/bus_space.c			1.24

	Fix a bug where mapping the very end of iomem accidentally
	returns an address in the ISA hole. Fixes ohci on VirtualPC
	7 for Mac, which places OHCI at base address 0xfffff000
	size 0x1000.
	[jmcneill, ticket #940]

	Catch up to audio(4) device_t/softc split.
	[jmcneill, ticket #945]

sys/dev/pad/files.pad				1.4

	PR# kern/39899: audio attach with pad(4) segfaults
	Make sure pad pulls in auconv mulaw support.
	[jmcneill, ticket #947]

sys/dev/rnd.c					1.74

	rnd_wakeup_readers() uses rndpool_mtx for its own consistency
	management, so it cannot be called with the mutex held.  There
	is no consistency requirement to synchronize over the whole
	add-and-wakeup operation, as if data is consumed in the window
	the mutex is locked, wakeups will simply be skipped.

	Fix from Juho Salminen in PR kern/42020.
	[pooka, ticket #948]

sys/arch/alpha/alpha/cpu.c			1.86

	There's now some per-cpu initialization that occurs before the
	secondary cpus are told to begin running.  Since the seconedary
	cpus weren't being added to the cpu_info list until then, that
	initialization wasn't being done and resulted in crashes on the
	secondary cpus.  Add the secondary cpus to the cpu_info_list
	after they've been started (but waiting to be told to start
	running).  This fixes the problem specifically stated in PR
	port-alpha/41106.  MP alphas will now at least boot and begin
	running, but will eventually crash in various ways later.
	[mhitch, ticket #949]

sys/arch/alpha/alpha/pmap.c			1.241

	Now that secondary cpus are added the cpu_info list earlier,
	attempt to send pmap tlb shootdowns to them cause the shootdown
	job queue to fill up, but since the cpus aren't running yet, no
	IPIs get sent.  When the job queue is full, the bit mask of cpus
	to send the IPI to is not set and no shootdown IPI ever gets sent
	after the cpu is marked running.  Always set the cpumask even
	when the queue is full.
	[mhitch, ticket #953]

sys/arch/alpha/alpha/pmap.c			1.242

	Alpha will size the mutex structure in pmap_tlb_shootdown_q to
	16 bytes.  Change the command and pad accordingly;  now
	pmap_tlb_shootdown_q entries really are cache-aligned.
	[mhitch, ticket #954]

sys/arch/vax/vax/clock.c			1.51

	Keep track of the previous ICR value and hardclock_ticks to
	ensure the 32 bit counter doesn't go backwards.  Also, the ICR
	runs from -10000 to -1, so adjust the value when reading it.
	Now mfpr works quite nicely on a 4000/90.
	[mhitch, ticket #955]

sys/arch/amiga/conf/files.amiga			1.141

	Switch the amiga to the common m68k/m68k/pmap_motorola.c.
	[mhitch, ticket #956]

sys/arch/alpha/conf/GENERIC			1.329

	Add the I2O iop controller, as used in the ES40 and ES45.

xsrc/external/mit/xorg-server/dist/os/utils.c	1.2

	By default, use the old X server background and cursor mode
	(option "-retro").  Add a "-noretro" option to get the new
	(black background and no cursor) behavior.  Addresses part
	of PR xsrc/41870.
	[mrg, ticket #1018]

sys/arch/sgimips/gio/newport.c			1.11

	A bunch of bugfixes:
	- set blitter direction appropriately so scrolling downwards
	  works now
	- remove a bunch of false +1 so we only copy/erase what we really
	  need to
	- fix the logic for the cursor sprite offset
	[macallan, ticket #963]

sys/arch/sgimips/gio/newportreg.h		1.4

	[macallan, ticket #982]

sys/arch/sgimips/gio/files.gio			1.10
sys/arch/sgimips/gio/newport.c			1.12

	Become a good vcons citizen.  Also, don't use the cursor sprite
	as text cursor - it's not worth the pain and the sprite doesn't
	have an invert-background plane either so the cursor wasn't
	transparent.  Instead blit the cursor using the appropriate ROPs.
	This way we get rid of the cursor misplacement problem as well.
	While there also use device_t.
	[macallan, ticket #981]

sys/arch/sgimips/gio/newport.c			1.13

	Don't bother drawing a cursor until wsdisplay attaches. This
	works around the deadlock I've seen with the previous version.
	While there do some KNF policing.
	[macallan, ticket #974]

sys/arch/sgimips/ioc/ioc.c			1.8

	Comment out some register initialization which the firmware
	should have taken care of anyway. Doing this here disrupts
	newport's blitter operations and causes a deadlock.

	int 15h/AH=86h (WAIT) doesn't work properly on all hardware and

	# Intel High Definition Audio
	hdaudio*        at pci? dev ? function ?
	hdafg*          at hdaudiobus?

	lock owner can change while cur's lock is released (cur's lock is
	also the tschain_t's mutex).  Remove the KASSERT about owner
	being invariant and try to deal with the fact that the owner can
	change instead.

sys/ufs/ufs/ufs_ihash.c				1.27

	PR kern/41147: race between nfsd and local rm.  Note that the race
	also exists between 2 nfs client, one of them doing the rm.  In
	ufs_ihashget(), vget() can return a vnode that has been vclean'ed
	because vget() can sleep. After vget returns, check that vp is
	still connected with ip, and that ip still points to the inode we
	want.

	Allow tunefs to clear any type of WAPBL log, not only
	in-filesystem ones.
	--
	Do some basic checks of the WAPBL journal, to abort the boot
	before the kernel refuse to mount a filesystem read-write
	(booting a system multiuser with critical filesystems read-only
	is bad): Add a check_wapbl() which will check some WAPBL values
	in the superblock, and try to read the journal via
	wapbl_replay_start() if there is one.  pfatal() if one of these
	fail (abort boot if in preen mode, as "CONTINUE" otherwise). In
	non-preen mode the bogus journal will be cleared.
	check_wapbl() is always called if the superblock supports WAPBL.
	Even if FS_DOWAPBL is not there, there could be flags asking the
	kernel to clear or create a log with bogus values which would
	cause the kernel refuse to mount the filesystem.
	--
	If the WAPBL journal can't be read (ffs_wapbl_replay_start() fails),
	mount the filesystem anyway if MNT_FORCE is present.
	This allows to still boot single-user a system with a corrupted
	WAPBL on /, and so get a chance to run fsck to fix it.

	system state by creating a new node.  If we do not protect the
	file system by holding the directory lock, a lookup operation
	might race us into the kernel and create the node earlier.
	Remove pnode from hashlish before sending the reclaim faf off to

sys/kern/uipc_usrreq.c				1.127

	In uipc_usrreq(PRU_ACCEPT), grab the unp_streamlock before
	unp_setpeerlocks().  This fixes a race where, for a short period
	of time, so->so_lock and so2->so_lock are not sync. This makes
	solocked2() and solocked() unreliable and cause DIAGNOSTIC kernel
	panics. This also fixes a possible panic in unp_setaddr() which
	expects the socket locked.  Should fix kern/38968.

	age(4):
	- Support flow control.
	- Add TWSI registers.
	- Don't access VPD even if hardware advertised the capability.
	  It seems that some revisions of the controllers hang while
	  accessing the VPD. Because VPD access routine is now unused,
	  nuke it.
	- Let TWSI reload EEPROM if VPD capability is detected. Reloading
	  the EEPROM will also set the Ethernet address, so age(4) now
	  reads AGE_PAR0 and AGE_PAR1 register to get the Ethernet address.
	  This removes removes a lot of hacks and enhance readability a lot.
	- Double PHY reset timeout as it takes more time to take the PHY out
	  of power-saving state.
	- Explicitly check power-saving state by checking undocumented PHY
	  registers. If link is not up, poke undocumented registers to take
	  PHY out of power-saving state. This is the same thing done by the
	  Linux driver.
	- Don't rely on auto-clearing feature of master reset bit, just wait
	  1ms and check idle status of MAC.

	age(4) and ale(4):
	Use m_pullup to handle defragmentation.
	Reinject mbuf into TX queue when it couldn't be loaded.

	The tarfs image in cdhdinstall used to get padded out to an 18KB
        boundary (the size of the read used to read it) with the
        alpha-specific image creation.  This got lost when moved to using
        common routines, so that burning the cdhdinstall image onto a CDROM
        resulted in a failure to read the last block of the tarfs image.

	* Don't bring up interfaces brought down when handling new interfaces
	* Allow un-encapsulated vendor option
	* Don't null terminate gratuitously when handling quotes.
	* Fix various typos and grammatical errors. Thanks to Stephen Borrill.
	* ClientID is now reported when interface starts

sys/kern/vfs_subr.c				1.392

	Previous caused a deadlock with layered FS: the vrele thread can

	failure because of the VI_INACTNOW flag). With layered FSes,
	the upper and lower vnodes share the same lock, so the vget()
	caller above can be already holding the vnode lock.
	Fix by dropping VI_INACTNOW before sleeping on the vnode lock in
	vrelel(), and check the ref count again once we have the lock.
	If the vnode has more than one reference, don't VOP_INACTIVE it.

	Pull up the RAIDframe parity map Summer Of Code project.
	Drastically reduces the amount of time spent rewriting parity
	after an unclean shutdown by keeping better track of which
	regions might have had outstanding writes.  Enabled by default;
	can be disabled on a per-set basis, or tuned, with the new
	raidctl(8) commands.
	[tron, ticket #1187]

sys/kern/sys_mqueue.c				1.28 via patch

	Fix some security critical bugs:
	- an invalid signal number passed to mq_notify(2) could crash the
	kernel on delivery -- add a boundary check
	- mq_receive(2) from an empty queue crashed the kernel by NULL
	dereference in timeout calculation -- handle the NULL case
	- likewise for mq_send(2) to a full queue
	- a user could set mq_maxmsg (the maximal number of messages in a
	queue) to a huge value on mq_open(O_CREAT) and later use up all
	kernel memory by mq_send(2) -- add a sysctl'able limit which defaults
	to 16*mq_def_maxmsg
	[tron, ticket #1188]

sys/kern/kern_time.c				1.163

	If a struct sigevent with SIGEV_SIGNAL is passed to timer_create(2),
	check the signal number to be in the allowed range. An invalid
	signal number could crash the kernel by overflowing the sigset_t
	array.
	[drochner, ticket #1189]

lib/libcurses/curses.h				1.94
lib/libcurses/keypad.c				1.11

	Make keypad return an int instead of nothing, as the SUS and even
	curses_input(3) [!] say it should.
	[drochner, ticket #1190]

sbin/raidctl/raidctl.c				1.43

	Slight change to the wording of the parity map info: the parity
	is "marked clean" after however much inactivity; it is *actually*
	clean as soon as the component disks all do their thing (on the
	order of ms, usually), just the same as before.

sys/arch/x86/x86/coretemp.c			1.13

	CPU model and CPU extended model cannot simply be summed; the
	extended model differentiates different CPUs within a given model
	type (i.e., model 0xe with extended model 0x1 is NOT the same as a
	model 0xf).  Modern Xeons do not support MSR_IA32_EXT_CONFIG, so
	use model and extended model correctly to avoid it
	[sborrill, ticket #1180]

sys/arch/x86/x86/intel_busclock.c		1.9

	Interim workaround for modern Xeons that don't have the simplistic
	view of bus speed and therefore do not support MSR_FSB_FREQ (e.g.,
	X3400).

	- Accept uppercase hex digits when parsing a provided key.
	[plunky, ticket #1192]

sys/arch/sparc64/dev/lom.c			1.4

	Merge change of OpenBSD rev 1.20: Remove debug printf and properly

	Don't attempt to read or write ~/.lesshst if it's not a regular file
