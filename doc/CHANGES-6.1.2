# $NetBSD: CHANGES-6.1.2,v 1.1.2.6 2013/09/17 19:54:49 msaitoh Exp $

A complete list of changes from the NetBSD 6.1.1 release to the NetBSD 6.1.2
release:

doc/README.files				patched by hand
gnu/usr.bin/groff/tmac/mdoc.local		patched by hand
sys/sys/param.h					patched by hand

	Welcome to 6.1.1_PATCH.
	[bouyer]

sys/fs/udf/udf_allocation.c			1.34

	Fix 32 bit issue in main file read-in function. On both 32 bit and
	64 bit hosts a missing cast would result in `garbage' after the
	4Gbyte limit.
	[reinoud, ticket #930]

sys/dev/pci/virtio.c				1.4

	Make sure to check if the driver has a valid intr handler in
	virtio_detach().
	Fixes a panic during shutdown on KVM under ubuntu 13.04 with virtio,
	as reported in PR kern/48105 by Richard Hansen.
	[tsutsui, ticket #931]

sys/nfs/nfs_bio.c				1.189

	Change nfs_vinvalbuf() to keep errors from vinvalbuf() for fsync() or
	close().
	Fix for PR kern/47980 (NFS over-quota not detected if utimes() called
	before fsync()/close())
	[hannken, ticket #933]

sys/arch/amiga/amiga/amiga_init.c		1.127
sys/arch/m68k/m68k/pmap_motorola.c		1.66

	Set user page table base address dynamically on amiga. This unbreaks
	machines with large Zorro III I/O spaces.
	Patch originally by Michael L. Hitch.
	[rkujawa, ticket #935]

sys/net/bpf.c					1.176

	Avoid kernel panic caused by setting a very small bpf buffer size.
	Fixes PR/48198 reported by Peter Bex.
	[spz, ticket #941]

sys/net/npf/npf_inet.c				1.23

	Fix bugs to prevent panic:
	- npf_cache_ip: re-fetch IPv6 header since nbufs might have been
          reallocated.
	- npf_cache_all: clear NBUF_DATAREF_RESET since npf_cache_ip() handles
	  it.
	[riz, ticket #942]
lib/libc/stdlib/_env.c				1.8

	Don't scrub the environment unless we are going to change it.
	This should prevent crashes in applications which carefully and
	manually construct a temporary environment and later restore the
	original environment like Emacs 24.
	[tron, ticket #940]

external/bsd/pkg_install/dist/lib/pkg_signature.c 1.2

	Fixed installation of signed packages. Some variables part of struct
	signature_archive were not initialized properly, therefore randomly
	failing in the verify_signature_read_cb() callback.
	Partly closes PR pkg/48194.
	[khorben, ticket #943]
