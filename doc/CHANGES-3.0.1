doc/README.files				patch

	Update for release and new CHANGES-3.0.1 file.

lib/libc/gen/getcwd.c				1.41

	but also set errno to ENOENT.
	[elad, ticket #1068]

	hold kernel_lock while calling systrace_exit().
	fixes PR 25856.

sys/kern/kern_systrace.c			1.50 via patch

	in systrace_make_msg(), sleep uninterruptibly while waiting for
	the response from the systrace daemon, so that the message protocol
	between the kernel and the daemon doesn't get out of sync.
	fixes PR 29654.
	[chs, ticket #1071]

sys/fs/union/union_vfsops.c			1.32

	Change union_unmount() to not play with the fs root vnode explicitly.

	[bouyer, ticket #1125]

lib/libc/rpc/xdr_rec.c				1.26

	John Kohl: xdr_rec.c missing a bugfix for an improper security
	check.  The correct way to check for a zero record length is to
	check for it without the LAST_FRAG marker in it, since it's legal
	to send a LAST_FRAG marker with 0 bytes of data.  PR#32572

	[christos, ticket #1128]

distrib/amiga/miniroot/install.md		1.25
