sys/fs/union/union_vfsops.c			1.32

	Change union_unmount() to not play with the fs root vnode explicitly.

	[bouyer, ticket #1125]

lib/libc/rpc/xdr_rec.c				1.26

	John Kohl: xdr_rec.c missing a bugfix for an improper security
	check.  The correct way to check for a zero record length is to
	check for it without the LAST_FRAG marker in it, since it's legal
	to send a LAST_FRAG marker with 0 bytes of data.  PR#32572

	[christos, ticket #1128]

distrib/amiga/miniroot/install.md		1.25
