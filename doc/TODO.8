$NetBSD: TODO.8,v 1.1 2016/07/26 04:18:04 martin Exp $

Items we (currently) plan to finish before branching netbsd-8:

 - find a releng release driver volunteer
 - import binutils 2.26.1
 - switch all architectures to gcc 5.4
 - switch all architectures to new binutils and gdb
 - enable PIE/ASLR on all architectures (that have switched to gcc 5.4 if
   we fail previous item) where it works

and of course: fix as many bugs as possible.
