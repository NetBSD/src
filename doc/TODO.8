$NetBSD: TODO.8,v 1.5 2016/10/26 20:05:11 christos Exp $

Items we (currently) plan to finish before branching netbsd-8:

 - find a releng release driver volunteer
 - enable PIE/ASLR on all architectures (that have switched to gcc 5.4 if
   we fail previous item) where it works
 - get lfs64 done for experimental use [dholland]

and of course: fix as many bugs as possible.
