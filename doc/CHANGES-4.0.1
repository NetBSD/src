	[tron, ticket #1047]

	[tsutsui, ticket #1025]

sys/arch/cobalt/cobalt/machdep.c		1.91

	In icu_intr_establish(), don't panic if the specified irq

common/dist/zlib/inflate.c			1.4

	Disable a sanity check output buffer != NULL in _STANDALONE case.

	well as random pool corruption.
	[tsutsui, ticket #1028]

dist/nawk/lex.c					1.8

	Bring back the fix in revision 1.6, apparently accidentally lost 
	during last merge, to allow escape of a newline in string literals.

games/larn/bill.c				1.9
games/larn/header.h				1.18 via patch
games/larn/main.c				1.21
games/larn/scores.c				1.16 via patch

	Since games are (now) setgid, not setuid, it is no longer necessary to
	manipulate the effective uid, only the effective gid.
	Use mkstemp to make the temporary files used when you win.
	[dholland, ticket #1067]
