	Substantial overhaul of podule IDs.  Unlike on PCI or USB, podule IDs
	are assigned by RISCOS Ltd (and were assigned by Acorn) to be unique
	across all manufacturers.  This means that associating each one with
	a manufacturer (and checking the manufacturer when attaching) is
	bogus. Thus, we don't do that any more.

	This should have the pleasant side-effect of getting APDL IDE
	interfaces working, since they're just ICS ones with a different
	manufacturer ID.
	[chris, ticket #120]

	Do not consult routing table under the following condition:
	- the destination is IPv4 multicast or 255.255.255.255, and
	- outgoing interface is specified via socket option
	This simplifies operation of routed
	(no longer require 224.0.0.0/4 to be set up)

sys/arch/powerpc/mpc6xx/pmap.c			1.46

	Set SR_PRKEY for user pmaps.  For the kernel SR(s) set
	SR_SUKEY|SR_PRKEY. Note that we never use a PTE PP of 0 or 1
	(supervisor protection) so the "key" is basically unused.  However,
	use SR_PRKEY for user space is conceptionally the right thing to do.
	Currently the kernel_pmap SR(s) are ignored but that is going to be
	fixed shortly.
	[matt, ticket #372]

sys/arch/powerpc/powerpc/trap_subr.S		1.22

	Revamp how SR(s) are loaded on the user/kernel boundary. We now load
	all 16 SR registers when transitioning between kernel and user.  Also,
	don't reload the kernel SR(s) on every trap but only on traps from
	user space. Instead of loading magic SRs for the kernel, load the
	kernel SRs from the kernel_pmap_. This makes trap_subr.S completely
	ignorant of SR uses and so they can change with having to change
	trap_subr.S. Also note that since the user and kernel get complete
	SR sets, user VA space can now be increased to 4GB if desired.
	[matt, ticket #373]

sys/arch/powerpc/include/mpc6xx/vmparam.h	1.2

	* Print a message if we're in a 64-bit slot and 64-bit data is

sys/dev/pci/if_sip.c				1.59

	Load configuration data from the EEPROM on the DP83820 differently:
	rather than grovel the EEPROM directly, initiate an "EEPROM load" in
	the PCI test register, and fetch the values from the CFG register.
	[thorpej, ticket #414]

sys/dev/pci/if_sip.c				1.60

	Add a table of known-64-bit DP83820-based cards.  Use this table
	to enable 64-bit data transfers on 64-bit cards when plugged into
	a 64-bit slot.  Right know the Asante GigaNIX is listed in that
	table.

	Sigh, there is an EEPROM bit that can be used to detect 64-bit vs
	32-bit cards.  Unfortunately, at least 2 vendors of 32-bit cards
	fail to clear the "DATA64_EN" bit in the EEPROM, which causes the
	card to lose badly, because it still manages to detect that it's
	plugged into a 64-bit PCI slot.  Yay, stupid hardware vendors.

	Several bugs:
	- Move calls to softdep_setup_pagecache() (which can sleep

	- Replace the softdep_flush_indir() hack (which tries to
	  find another vnode to fsync when we are holding lots of
	  buffer-cache buffers locked for long periods of time) with
	  softdep_trackbufs() (which just kicks the syncer and
	  sleeps under the same circumstances). the former method
	  had a lock-ordering problem which would occasionally
	  deadlock.
	- Relax the assertion in softdep_sync_metadata() which says
	  that we should never see D_ALLOCDIRECT deps for VREG vnodes.
	  It's OK to see those attached to indirect blocks.
	Also, there's no need to splbio() while allocating the
	buffer headers to which pagecache dependencies are attached,
	so remove that.  Fixes PR#19288.

	ftpd was unable to service the pwd request once you entered

	We fix this problem by maitaining a cached path when getcwd()
	does not work. The symbolic links and ../ are resolved in
	the cached path, and it is finnally checked for accuracy
	by comparing ./ and the cached path with stat (device and
	inode comparison). If the comparison fails, pwd fails as
	it did before, and if the comparison succeeds, the cached
	path is displayed.

	If paths are too long, we should just compare ./ with a
	truncated path and fail, thus making pwd displaying an
	error as it did before.
