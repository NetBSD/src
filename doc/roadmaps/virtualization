NetBSD Virtualization Roadmap
=============================

This is a small roadmap document, and deals with the virtualization
side of the operating system.

Features that will be in 6.0:
1. NetBSD/usermode
5. Xen domU migration, suspend and resume

Features which may make future releases:
2. virtualization jails via secmodel
3. iSCSI booting
4. iSCSI device cloning

We'll continue to update this roadmap as features and dates get firmed up.


Some explanations
=================

1. NetBSD/usermode
------------------

NetBSD/usermode is an port of NetBSD to a POSIX-compatible user-space,
with the intention that it should be possible to run the usermode
version of NetBSD on any POSIX-compatible operating system.  This code
has been committed to the repository by jmcneill, and updated by reinoud
and jmcneill. usermode can now boot up to X11, can use a vnc console,
and is under active development now. This is most definitely in 6.0.

Responsible: jmcneill, reinoud

2. Virtualization Jails via secmodel
------------------------------------

One novel way of creating jails for virtualization is to use a new
secmodel (part of the kauth framework), to isolate processes into
jail-based virtual machines. This is the basis of a paper given by
bad@ at AsiaBSDcon in March 2008. This will not make 6.0

Responsible: bad

3. iSCSI booting
----------------

In order to make Xen domains migration-friendly, the storage that the
domain uses must be based on some form of network-centric storage, either
NFS, or a SAN or IP-SAN. For IP-SANs, iSCSI booting will be used. This
is dependent on the in-kernel iSCSI initiator project completing. This will not make 6.0

Responsible: agc

4. iSCSI device cloning
-----------------------

To minimise the storage requirements for multiple domU booting, using
a standard root filesystem or block device for the domU is required, along
with some form of copy-on-write mechanism to preserve any modifications
that are made. This will not make 6.0

Responsible: agc

5. Xen domU migration, suspend and resume
-----------------------------------------

Xen domU migration is where a domU domain is moved from one dom0 to
another dom0 on the same vlan (to avoid networking problems, the
virtual arp address migrates with the domU itself). jym has committed
this code, and it will be in 6.0

Responsible: jym, bouyer
