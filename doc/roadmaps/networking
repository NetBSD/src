NetBSD Networking Roadmap
=========================

This is a small roadmap document, and deals with the networking
side of the operating system.

The following projects are expected to be included in NetBSD 8.0
0. SCTP

The following features are expected to be in future releases:
1. net80211 support [n/ac]
2. Mobile IPv6
3. network driver polling
4. ALTQ processing on input
5. integrated multicast dns / zeroconf
6. tcp support in libsa
7. netboot from http
8. MP network stack (Layer 3 and below)
9. MP network stack (rest)
10. Infiniband

We'll continue to update this roadmap as features and dates get firmed up.

Some explanations
=================

0. SCTP
-------

Add support for the SCTP for both IPv4 and IPv6.

Responsible: rjs
Status: committed, done

1. net80211 [n/ac]
------------------

Resync FreeBSD stack to get support for n, ac, VAP

Responsible: phil
Status: started porting FreeBSD code
Comment[christos]: This will add VAP support too, and needs changes to all
the specific drivers.

2. Mobile IPv6
--------------

Responsible: rjs
Status: compiles, not debugged yet.
Comment[christos]: XXX: Fill in the project description and justification.

3. network driver polling
-------------------------

Responsible: matt
Status: not started
Comment[christos]: XXX: Fill in the project description and justification.


4. ALTQ processing for input
----------------------------

Responsible: matt
Status: not started
Comment[christos]: The ALTQ code and interface is very messy and there
is a lot of code duplication. People (ozaki-r/knakahara) are working on
this as part as MP stack


5. multicast DNS / zeroconf
---------------------------

Add support for multicast DNS (name.local)

Responsible: tsarna
Status: not started
Comment[christos]: XXX: Fill in the project description and justification.


6. tcp support in libsa
-----------------------

Add a tiny tcp implementation to libsa.

Responsible: matt
Status: not started
Comment[christos]: XXX: Why? What's going to use it?


7. http netbooting
------------------

Be able to use a HTTP server hosting a kernel and/or disk image as a
read-only root device.

Responsible: TBD
Status: not started
Comment[christos]: Not very interesting

8. net SMP work (Layer 3 and below)
-----------------------------------

Make multi-threaded network stack. Targets are Layer 3 (IP forwarding),
Layer 2 (ARP, NDP, bridge, vlan and bpf) and some tunnel devices (gif,
ipsec and pppoe).

Responsible: ozaki-r,knakahara
Status: in progress

9. net SMP work (rest)
----------------------

Make multi-threaded network stack. Get tasks other than the above targets down.

Responsible: TBD
Status: not started

10. Infiniband
--------------

We do not really have Infiniband support. We should; since it still
hasn't quite died, it probably isn't going to.
