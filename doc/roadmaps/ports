NetBSD Ports Roadmap
====================

This roadmap covers ports and port-specific issues, and also bus-level
material even if it's not strictly port-specific.

The following elements, projects, and goals are considered strategic
priorities for the project:

 1. EFI boot for x86
 2. xhci support (done and will be in -8)
 3. Get arm64/aarch64 working

The following elements, projects, and goals are not strategic
priorities but are still important undertakings worth doing:

 4. riscv and/or or1k ports
 5. cheri port

The following elements, projects, and goals are perhaps less pressing;
this doesn't mean one shouldn't work on them but the expected payoff
is perhaps less than for other things:

 [none presently]


Explanations
============


 1. EFI boot for x86

EFI boot is now often required for new x86 hardware. This is
effectively a mandatory item for -8. Fortunately, nonaka has most of
it done, though it's not yet committed.

 - As of January 2017 nobody is known to be working on this.
 - There is currently no clear timeframe or release target.
 - Contact agc for further information.


 2. xhci support

xhci is also critical for new x86 hardware. skrll@ says this is done;
it will be -8.

 3. Get arm64/aarch64 working

We have some arm64 code but apparently it doesn't really work yet.

 - As of January 2017 nobody is known to be actively working on this.
 - There is currently no clear timeframe or release target.
 - Contact: ? (XXX)


 4. riscv and/or or1k ports

We have some riscv code and a bit of or1k code, but neither is done.

 - As of January 2017 nobody is known to be working on this.
 - There is currently no clear timeframe or release target.
 - Contact matt@ for further information.


 5. cheri port

http://cheri-cpu.org
There are a number of reasons to tackle this; it will serve as a code
quality lever. Also there's already a FreeBSD port to steal from.
