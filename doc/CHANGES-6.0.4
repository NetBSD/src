	Welcome to 6.0.3_PATCH.
	[jdc]

xsrc/external/mit/xorg-server/dist/dix/dixfonts.c	1.2
xsrc/xfree/xc/programs/Xserver/dix/dixfonts.c		1.4

	Fix CVE-2013-4396 using a patch from Alan Coopersmith:
	Save a pointer to the passed in closure structure before copying it
	and overwriting the *c pointer to point to our copy instead of the
	original.  If we hit an error, once we free(c), reset c to point to
	the original structure before jumping to the cleanup code that
	references *c.
	[spz, ticket #966]

sys/arch/x86/pci/pci_machdep.c			1.61 via patch

	Force PCI mode 1 when running under QEMU, to work around
	QEMU bug 897771.
	This should also make it possible to boot NetBSD under versions of KVM
	that have inherited said QEMU bug.  Fixes PR kern/45671.
	[gson, ticket #963]

sys/netinet/tcp_usrreq.c			1.168

	Add missing i810_dri.c file to SRCS.
	PR xsrc/48315.
	[martin, ticket #971]

distrib/utils/sysinst/mbr.c			1.92

	Add missing braces, which caused the offset of MBR partition 0 to be
	unintentionally set to 2048 even on small (<=128GB) disks.
	PR/48304.
	[tsutsui, ticket #972]

sys/arch/xen/xen/xbdback_xenbus.c		1.58

	Fix a dom0 panic, or crash with a hypervisor panic, when creating
	some domUs (domUs where the frontend driver doesn't provide a
	"protocol" entry in the xenstore).
	[bouyer, ticket #974]

libexec/ld.elf_so/tls.c				1.9
tests/lib/libc/tls/dso/h_tls_dlopen.c		1.5

	Only initialise TLS space from the PT_TLS segment, if the size is
	positive and the offset has been computed. Fixes PR lib/48324.
	[joerg, ticket #976]

usr.sbin/npf/npfctl/npf_ncgen.c			patch
