	[jdc]

xsrc/external/mit/xorg-server/dist/dix/dixfonts.c	1.2
xsrc/xfree/xc/programs/Xserver/dix/dixfonts.c		1.4

	Fix CVE-2013-4396 using a patch from Alan Coopersmith:
	Save a pointer to the passed in closure structure before copying it
	and overwriting the *c pointer to point to our copy instead of the
	original.  If we hit an error, once we free(c), reset c to point to
	the original structure before jumping to the cleanup code that
	references *c.
	[spz, ticket #966]
