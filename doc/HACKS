hack	netstat ieee1394 address printing.
mdate	14 Nov 2000
who	matt
file	lib/libc/net/getnameinfo.c	: 1.32 : 497 : 503
descr
	Because the current implementation of IP over IEEE1394, the
	fw device address contains more than just the IEEE1394 EUI-64.
	So when printing out IEEE1394 addresses, ignore the extra stuff.

hack	xterm vs. libterm
mdate	01 Aug 2000
who	jdc
file	xsrc/xc/programs/xterm/main.c	: 1.2 : 3609 : 3614
pr	10383
descr
	In order to extend the termcap string over 1023 bytes, a ZZ entry was
	introduced to point to a memory location containing the full entry.
	Without this hack, xterm will export a termcap containing the ZZ
	entry, which will then be ignored by libterm.  As xterm modifies the
	exported termcap, this would cause those modifications to be ignored.

hack	wi-at-big-endian-bus
cdate	15 Mar 2002
who	martin
file	dev/ic/wireg.h
descr	Add an option to access the underlying bus in big endian byte order
	to work around deficiencies in bus_space_{read,write}_* macros.
	Those don't allow the implementation of a proper pcmcia bus space
	tag.

hack	specific knowledge of colours in curses code
cdate	Sun Apr  6 11:05:24 BST 2003
who	jdc
file	lib/libcurses/color.c : r1.24
descr
	Swap red/blue and yellow/cyan colours for COLOR_OTHER.
	Fix is to enhance libtermcap to understand terminfo-style % sequences.

hack	Compensation for differing types of LINUX_USRSTACK and USRSTACK
cdate	21 Aug 2003
who	he
file	sys/miscfs/procfs/procfs_linux.c : 1.14
descr
	Not all ports have LINUX_USRSTACK and/or USRSTACK defined as
	literals/constants, but refer to variables of a type which is
	not "unsigned long", causing compilation of procfs_linux.c to
	fail with "makes integer from pointer without a cast".  This
	is observed on e.g. the sun3 port.  Ideally the "types" for
	symbols should be consistent across all ports.

hack	gcc-strict-aliasing
cdate	6 August 2004
who	junyoung
pr	26516
file	src/usr.sbin/racoon/racoon/Makefile : 1.21
descr
	GCC issues a warning "dereferencing type-punned pointer will break
	strict-aliasing rules" when compiling
	crypto/dist/kame/racoon/crypto/openssl.c with -O[23s]. Note that this
	is due to use of type casting in a non-standard way in the code and
	not a compiler bug. Once a new release of KAME with a proper fix
	applied is imported this should be backed out.

	GCC 4.1 gets many uninitialised variable warnings wrong.  We should
	really audit all the old hacks like this when older compilers are
	removed from the tree, as many are probably no longer required.
	The problem is that it does not recognize initialization via function
	call pointer. I.e.
		int p;
		foo(&p);
	does not mark p as initialized.

	descr	When checking that a potentially-unsigned enum is >= 0, assign
		it to an int first.  This is necessary to avoid "comparison is
		always true" warnings with -fshort-enums.  Casting to an int
		really should be enough, but turns out not to be.

	hack	gcc-4.5 arm CNAME hostname lookup failure on

	who	tsutsui

	descr	Hostname lookup against CNAMEs by some commands fails
		on certain DNS environments if lib/libc/net/gethnamaddr.c
		(ping(8) etc) and lib/libc/net/getaddrinfo.c (ftp(1) etc)
		are compiled with -O2, even though nslookup(1) against
		the same CNAME returns proper hostname.
		They works properly if compiled with -O2 -fno-tree-ter.
		Also -O2 fails but -O2 -fno-tree-ter works on the following
		test case in gcc bugzilla:

		Something is wrong with GCC 4.5.3 and the savefpstate IPI.
		Post newlock2 there was a bug where a lock was reduced from
		IPL_SCHED to IPL_VM (?) and occasionally savefpstate IPI
		would crash due to NULL IPI.  This was fixed by re-using the
		right IPL value.  However, GCC 4.5.3 build kernels have the
		same problems.  For now, the hack is re-instated.
