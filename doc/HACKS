hack	static linking with libpthread
mdate	7 May 2019

file	lib/libpthread/Makefile 1.92 -> 1.94
descr
	To avoid some libc thread stub functions being picked up
	in static builds, link pthread as one section.

hack	netstat ieee1394 address printing.
mdate	14 Nov 2000
who	matt
file	lib/libc/net/getnameinfo.c	: 1.32 : 497 : 503
descr
	Because the current implementation of IP over IEEE1394, the
	fw device address contains more than just the IEEE1394 EUI-64.
	So when printing out IEEE1394 addresses, ignore the extra stuff.

hack	xterm vs. libterm
mdate	01 Aug 2000
who	jdc
file	xsrc/xc/programs/xterm/main.c	: 1.2 : 3609 : 3614
pr	10383
descr
	In order to extend the termcap string over 1023 bytes, a ZZ entry was
	introduced to point to a memory location containing the full entry.
	Without this hack, xterm will export a termcap containing the ZZ
	entry, which will then be ignored by libterm.  As xterm modifies the
	exported termcap, this would cause those modifications to be ignored.

hack	wi-at-big-endian-bus
cdate	15 Mar 2002
who	martin
file	dev/ic/wireg.h
descr	Add an option to access the underlying bus in big endian byte order
	to work around deficiencies in bus_space_{read,write}_* macros.
	Those don't allow the implementation of a proper pcmcia bus space
	tag.

	Fix is to enhance libtermcap to understand terminfo-style % sequences.

hack	Compensation for differing types of LINUX_USRSTACK and USRSTACK
cdate	21 Aug 2003
who	he
file	sys/miscfs/procfs/procfs_linux.c : 1.14
descr
	Not all ports have LINUX_USRSTACK and/or USRSTACK defined as
	literals/constants, but refer to variables of a type which is
	not "unsigned long", causing compilation of procfs_linux.c to
	fail with "makes integer from pointer without a cast".  This
	is observed on e.g. the sun3 port.  Ideally the "types" for
	symbols should be consistent across all ports.

	GCC 4.1 gets many uninitialised variable warnings wrong.  We should
	really audit all the old hacks like this when older compilers are
	removed from the tree, as many are probably no longer required.
	The problem is that it does not recognize initialization via function
	call pointer. I.e.
		int p;
		foo(&p);
	does not mark p as initialized.

descr
	Our cabs and cabsf have a different argument format on some architectures
	and for that we have created in libm/compat_cabs{,f}.c. The standard
	versions in libc are __c99_cabs{,f,l} and there are __RENAME()'s in
	<complex.h>. G++ uses __builtin_cabs{,f,l} to implement those and they
	translate by default to cabs{,f,l} which gets defined to cabs{,f} (the
	wrong function) and an undefined cabsl. I've changed <complex> to use
	the __c99_cabs{,f,l} directly. Using the __builtin_cabs{,f,l} in gcc is
	still broken.
