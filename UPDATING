$NetBSD: UPDATING,v 1.62 2002/05/18 15:44:18 jdolecek Exp $

This file is intended to be a brief introduction to the build
process and a reference on what to do if something doesn't work.

For a more detailed description see Makefile.

Recent changes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

20020515:
	sshd user/group has been added.  Need to hand add this in, or sshd
	will not let you log in (with default, or UsePrivlegeSeparation=yes)

	Add the following into /etc/group:

	sshd:*:16:

	and the following to /etc/master.passwd (via vipw):

	sshd:*:16:16::0:0:sshd privsep:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin
	
	also /var/chroot/sshd directory needs to be present (digged as a part of
	build process).

20020426:
	NBUILDJOBS obsoleted in favor of just using -j.

20020426:
	etc/postinstall added, which performs various checks for 
	configuration file updates and changes, and can fix most of
	the problems identified.
	This should make it much easier to upgrade a system's
	configuration from earlier systems (as far back as NetBSD 1.5).

20020320:
	<bsd.lib.mk> needs a new install(1) for it's "-a cmd" support.
	build and install at usr.bin/xinstall before the build.

20020319:
	raw IPv6 socket now makes strict checking for sa_family and sa_len
	on send(2) operation.  be sure to have sbin/rtsol and usr.sbin/rtsold
	newer than November 2001 when you upgrade the kernel.

20020311:
	ssh configuration files were moved from /etc to /etc/ssh.  Beware
	if you restart your machine from remote.  Note that sshd.conf needs
	to be changed (due to the use of "/etc" inside).

20020223:
	Users of the VAX port will need to rebuild and install gas
	so it deal with the now present register prefix used in all
	the VAX assembly files.

20020118:

	ntpd user/group has been added.  Need to hand add this in or builds
	will break as mtree aborts early.

	Add the following into /etc/group:

	ntpd:*:15:

	and the following to /etc/master.passwd (via vipw):

	ntpd:*:15:15::0:0:Ntpd pseudo-user:/var/chroot/ntpd:/sbin/nologin

20011207:

	If you're attempting to build a snapshot on sparc64 and are getting
	reloc errors from the toolchain groff binary this means your native
	toolchain has some broken C++ bits.

	To fix:

	Build a new toolchain (i.e. build.sh -t)
	Use the new toolchain to build and install natively (i.e. /usr/lib)

	gnu/lib/libgcc
	gnu/lib/libstdc++

	After this a snapshot will be able to be built.

20011201:
	In order for a sparc64 build to work you must have a working awk. If
	you've built and installed a system with the new toolchain up to this
	point you do not have a working awk as its ability to do floating
	point is broken. 

	To build:

	remake and install gnu/lib/libgcc
	remake and install gnu/usr.bin/gawk into /usr/bin (make sure it links
	against the new libgcc.a)

20011128:
	Kernel config information was changed to use defflag in
	the various "files" files.  Bug fixes to config(8) are
	required in order for this to work properly.  Make sure
	to build and install in usr.sbin/config before attempting
	to build a new kernel.

20011030:
	libc/locale/wcstod.c now needs new lint(1). Update lint(1)
	before building libc.

20011029:
	The new document BUILDING.mdoc (view with nroff | more, or
	see pre-generated .txt and .html versions) describes the build
	procedure in great detail.  BUILDING, and the USE_NEW_TOOLCHAIN
	build process, are intended in the long run to replace this
	manual update log.

	Users building a USE_NEW_TOOLCHAIN system should read the
	BUILDING document for caveats.  Generally, BUILDING supersedes
	UPDATING for these systems, as tool updating is taken care of
	by the new build system.

20011028:
	src/etc/Makefile now needs install to be able to handle
	symlinks that point to nowhere. A bug in install that
	prevented this was corrected.

	Solution: update and reinstall usr.bin/xinstall
	Better Solution: Use the new toolchain and it will just work
	for you.

20011006:
	/etc/mtree/NetBSD.dist has been updated to take advantage of
	absolute path support added to mtree(8). Older mtree(8)s don't
	understand the format.

	Solution: update and reinstall usr.sbin/mtree

20011004:
	Crunchgen has been updated to work via reach-over makefiles. Updating
	is suggested before running a snapshot build

20010915:
	The new "ubcperf" code committed by Chuck Silvers removed
	a header file, uvm/uvm_vnode.h.  There may be stale .depend
	files that still reference this file.

	Solution: "make cleandir && make dependall" in affected
	directories.

20010803:
	grep.info is now built from grep.texi using makeinfo.  Since it
	requires makeinfo v4.0, you need to install new texinfo before
	building gnu/usr.bin/grep.  To install new texinfo, please follow
	the instruction described in 20010726 entry.

20010803:
	(i386 only): i386 kernel now uses new instructions like
        `fxsave' which old gas doesn't understand.  To build the
	kernel successfully, you need to build and install new gas
	(gnu/usr.bin/gas.new), or (temporarily) comment out
	"options I686_CPU" from your kernel configuration until you
	rebuilt your userland (and got a new gas).

20010731:
	Bootloader update on ELF platforms.  DDB in kernels from before
	this will be unable to read symbol tables provided by newer
	bootloaders.

20010726:
	Texinfo was updated to 4.0.  To avoid failures when trying to
	build the included texinfo files, do:

	cd src/gnu/usr.bin/texinfo
	make MKINFO=no dependall install

20010718:
	Enabled correct .init/.fini processing in crt0.  The way this
	was done was to change a -I directive to cc(1), which means
	make(1) will have a stale dependency (it will be checking the
	timestamp on the wrong "dot_init.h").

	The symptom you will see is that new programs die with SIGSEGV
	if you have a stale dependency.

	Solution: "make cleandir" in both lib/csu and libexec/ld.elf_so
	before starting your build.

20010628:
	A construct was added to uvm_page.h that uncovered a bug
	in lint(1).  If you get a warning/error about a non-portable
	bitfield, update your lint(1) before proceeding.

20010226:
	Added named user/group to system. Need to hand add this in or builds
	will break as mtree aborts early.

	To work around add by hand:

	named:*:14:

	to /etc/group and add:

	named:*:14:14::0:0:Named pseudo-user:/var/named:/sbin/nologin

	to master.passwd (use vipw for instance if doing by hand).

	Now a make build should progress.

20010219:
	get/setprogname() added. Any hostprogs that may use this will need
        to be bootstrapped manually until the host system is current.

        Known problems: sys/arch/macppc/stand/fixcoff
			usr.sbin/config (adding -DMAKE_BOOTSTRAP to
			  CFLAGS and rebuilding should work)
			usr.sbin/mdsetimage - Build a static copy if
  		          building a snapshot before fully bootstrapped.

20010204:
	prepare the code to compile with stricter gcc flags. in
	particular start eliminating redundant declarations. Yacc
	needs to be installed before make build.

20010114:
	introduce .if commands(target) in make(1). You need to
	bring everything up-to-date first, then without installing
	anything make and install in usr.bin/make, then proceed
	with make build.

20010101:
	bsd.subdir.mk committed 20001230 had a bug which caused
	afterinstall targets to run too soon; update again.

20001230:
	New share/mk files needed to support .WAIT in SUBDIR variables.
	If you get make errors, 
		(cd share/mk; make install)
	Also, PRINTOBJDIR has changed and is now used more heavily.

20001019:
	The `ca' device driver has been replaced by `ld'; although the
	major and minor numbers haven't changed, you should update your /dev
	directory.

20000929:
	The following make directives are obsoleted.
	MKCRYPTO_RSA NOCRYPTO_RSA NOCRYPTO_RC5 NOCRYPTO_IDEA 
	By default, RSA is built into libcrypto.  IDEA and RC5 will not be
	built into libcrypto.  By using MKCRYPTO_{RC5,IDEA}, you can build
	additional library libcrypto_{idea,rc5}.


Hints for a more successful build:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Build a new kernel first:
	This makes sure that any new system calls or features
	   expected by the new userland will be present.  This
	   helps to avoid critical errors when upgrading.
    Use object directories:
	This helps to keep stale object
	   files from polluting the build if a Makefile "forgets"
	   about one.  It also makes it easier to clean up after
	   a build.  It's also necessary if you want to use the
	   same source tree for multiple machines.
	   To use object directories:
	    a) cd /usr/src ; make cleandir
	    b) Add "OBJMACHINE=yes" to /etc/mk.conf
	    c) Add "MKOBJDIRS=yes" to /etc/mk.conf
	    d) cd /usr/src ; make build
	   Note that running "make obj" in a directory will create
	   in obj.$MACHINE directory.
    Build to a DESTDIR:
	This helps to keep old
	   installed files (especially libraries) from interfering
	   with the new build.
	   To build to a DESTDIR, set the DESTDIR environment
	   variable before running make build.  It should be set to
	   the pathname of an initially empty directory.
	   Problems: you might need to update critical utilities
		without using DESTDIR since nothing is executed
		from what is installed in DESTDIR.
		(See critical utils, below)
    Build often:
	This keeps critical utilities current enough to not choke
	on any other part of the source tree that depends on up to
	date functionality.
 
What to do if things don't work:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When things don't work there is usually a few things that commonly
should be done.
    1)	make includes
	This should be done automatically by make build.
    2)  cd share/mk && make install
	Again, automatically done by make build.

Failsafe rebuild of a small part of the tree:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To make sure you rebuild something correctly you want to do
something like the following:
    1)  Make sure the includes and .mk files are up to date.
    2)  Make sure any program used to build the particular
	utility is up to date.  (yacc, lex, etc...)
    3)  cd ...path/to/util...
	make cleandir
	rm ...all obj directories...
	make cleandir			# yes, again
	make obj
	make depend && make

Failsafe rebuild of the entire tree:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you really want to make sure the source tree is clean and
ready for a build try the following.  Note that sourcing /etc/mk.conf
(a make(1) Makefile) in this manner is not right, and will not work
for anyone who uses any make(1) features in /etc/mk.conf.

---cut here---
#!/bin/sh
. /etc/mk.conf

if [ -z $NETBSDSRCDIR ] ; then
    NETBSDSRCDIR=/usr/src
fi
if [ \! -d $NETBSDSRCDIR ] ; then
    echo Unable to find sources
    exit 1
fi
find $NETBSDSRCDIR -name \*.o -o -name obj.\* -o -name obj -exec rm \{\} \;

if [ -z $BSDOBJDIR ] ; then
    BSDOBJDIR=/usr/obj
fi
if [ -d $BSDOBJDIR ] ; then
    rm -rf $BSDOBJDIR
fi

cd $NETBSDSRCDIR && make cleandir

---cut here---

Critical utilities:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	gnu/usr.bin/egcs
	usr.bin/compile_et
	usr.bin/make
	usr.bin/yacc
	usr.bin/lex
	usr.bin/xlint
	usr.sbin/config

Other problems and possible solutions:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Symptom:Unreasonable compiler errors.
Fix:	Rebuild gnu/usr.bin/egcs

Symptom:Complaints involving a Makefile.
Fix:	Rebuild usr.bin/make:
	cd usr.bin/make && make && make install
        Or, a failsafe method if that doesn't work:
	cd usr.bin/make && cc *.c */*.c -I . -o make && mv make /usr/bin

Fix:	Make sure .mk files are up to date.
	cd share/mk && make install

Symptom:Kernel `config' fails to configure any kernel, including GENERIC.
Fix:	Rebuild usr.sbin/config

Symptom:
Fix:	Rebuild usr.bin/yacc

Symptom:
Fix:	Rebuild usr.bin/lex

Symptom:
Fix:	rm /usr/lib/libbfd.a

Symptom:Obsolete intermediate files are used during compilation
Fix:	Try the following sequence of commands in the directory in question.
	make cleandir; rm `make print-objdir`; make cleandir; make obj
	(If you built the tree without "make obj" in the past, obsolete files
	may remain.  The command tries to clean everything up)

Symptom:.../sysinst/run.c:xx: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type
Fix:	Rebuild and install usr.bin/menuc

Symptom:mklocale not found during build in share/locale/ctype
Fix:	Build and install usr.bin/mklocale

Symptom:undefined reference to `__assert13'
Fix:    Rebuild and install lib/libc

Symptom:usr.sbin/config fails to build.
Fix:	Try building with -DMAKE_BOOTSTRAP added to CFLAGS in Makefile.

Symptom:undefined reference to `getprogname' or `setprogname'
Fix:    Rebuild and install lib/libc

Symptom:lint does not understand the '-X' option
Fix:    May need to build & install libs with NOLINT=1 before rebuilding lint
