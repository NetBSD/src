BUILDING(8)                 System Manager's Manual                BUILDING(8)

NAME
     BUILDING - Procedure for building NetBSD from source code.

REQUIREMENTS
     NetBSD is designed to be buildable on most POSIX-compliant host systems.
     The basic build procedure is the same whether compiling natively (on the
     same NetBSD architecture) or cross compiling (on another architecture or
     OS).

     This source tree contains a special subtree, "tools", which uses the host
     system to create a build toolchain for the target architecture.  The host
     system must have at least C and C++ compilers in order to create the
     toolchain (make is not required); all other tools are created as part of
     the NetBSD build process.  (See the environment variables section below
     if you need to override or manually select your compilers.)

     tools/compat/README
                    Special notes for cross-hosting a NetBSD build on non-
                    NetBSD platforms.

     Makefile       The main Makefile for NetBSD; should only be run for
                    native builds with an appropriately up-to-date version of
                    NetBSD make(1).  Intended for expert use with knowlege of
                    its shortcomings, it has been superseded by the build.sh
                    shell script as the recommended means for building NetBSD.

     UPDATING       Special notes for updating from an earlier revision of
                    NetBSD.  It is important to read this file before every
                    build of an updated source tree.

     build.sh       Bourne-compatible shell script used for building the host
                    build tools and the NetBSD system from scratch.  Can be
                    used for both native and cross builds, and should be used
                    instead of make(1) as it performs additional checks to
                    prevent common issues going undetected, such as building
                    with an outdated version of make(1).

     crypto/dist/, dist/, gnu/dist/
                    Sources imported verbatim from third parties, without
                    mangling the existing build structure.  Other source trees
                    in bin through usr.sbin use the NetBSD make(1) "reachover"
                    Makefile semantics when building these programs for a
                    native host.

     external, sys/external
                    Sources and build infrastructure for components imported
                    (mostly) unchanged from upstream maintainers, sorted by
                    applicable license.  This is (slowly) replacing the
                    crypto/dist, dist, and gnu/dist directories.

     distrib/, etc/
                    Sources for items used when making a full release
                    snapshot, such as files installed in DESTDIR/etc on the
                    destination system, boot media, and release notes.

     tests/, regress/
                    Regression test harness.  Can be cross-compiled, but only
                    run natively.  tests/ uses the atf(7) test framework;
                    regress/ contains older tests that have not yet been
                    migrated to atf(7).

     sys/           NetBSD kernel sources.

     tools/         "Reachover" build structure for the host build tools.
                    This has a special method of determining out-of-date
                    status.

     bin/ ... usr.sbin/
                    Sources to the NetBSD userland (non-kernel) programs.  If
                    any of these directories are missing, they will be skipped
                    during the build.

     external/mit/xorg/
                    "Reachover" build structure for modular Xorg; the source
                    is in X11SRCDIR.

     extsrc/        "Reachover" build structure for externally added programs
                    and libraries; the source is in EXTSRCSRCDIR.

   Build tree layout
     The NetBSD build tree is described in hier(7), and the release layout is
     described in release(7).

CONFIGURATION
   Environment variables
     Several environment variables control the behaviour of NetBSD builds.

     HOST_SH           Path name to a shell available on the host system and
                       suitable for use during the build.  The NetBSD build
                       system requires a modern Bourne-like shell with POSIX-
                       compliant features, and also requires support for the
                       "local" keyword to declare local variables in shell
                       functions (which is a widely-implemented but non-
                       standardised feature).

                       Depending on the host system, a suitable shell may be
                       /bin/sh, /usr/xpg4/bin/sh, /bin/ksh (provided it is a
                       variant of ksh that supports the "local" keyword, such
                       as ksh88, but not ksh93), or /usr/local/bin/bash.

                       Most parts of the build require HOST_SH to be an
                       absolute path; however, build.sh allows it to be a
                       simple command name, which will be converted to an
                       absolute path by searching the PATH.

     HOST_CC           Path name to C compiler used to create the toolchain.

     HOST_CXX          Path name to C++ compiler used to create the toolchain.

     MACHINE           Machine type, e.g., "macppc".

     MACHINE_ARCH      Machine architecture, e.g., "powerpc".

     MAKE              Path name to invoke make(1) as.

     MAKEFLAGS         Flags to invoke make(1) with.  Note that build.sh
                       ignores the value of MAKEFLAGS passed in the
                       environment, but allows MAKEFLAGS to be set via the -V
                       option.

     MAKEOBJDIR        Directory to use as the .OBJDIR for the current
                       directory.  The value is subjected to variable
                       expansion by make(1).  Typical usage is to set this
                       variable to a value involving the use of
                       `${.CURDIR:S...}' or `${.CURDIR:C...}', to derive the
                       value of .OBJDIR from the value of .CURDIR.  Used only
                       if MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX is not defined.  MAKEOBJDIR can be
                       provided only in the environment or via the -O flag of
                       build.sh; it cannot usefully be set inside a Makefile,
                       including mk.conf or ${MAKECONF}.

     MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX  Top level directory of the object directory tree.  The
                       value is subjected to variable expansion by make(1).
                       build.sh will create the ${MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX} directory
                       if necessary, but if make(1) is used without build.sh,
                       then rules in <bsd.obj.mk> will abort the build if the
                       ${MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX} directory does not exist.  If the
                       value is defined and valid, then
                       ${MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX}/${.CURDIR} is used as the .OBJDIR
                       for the current directory.  The current directory may
                       be read only.  MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX can be provided only in
                       the environment or via the -M flag of build.sh; it
                       cannot usefully be set inside a Makefile, including
                       mk.conf or ${MAKECONF}.

   "make" variables
     Several variables control the behavior of NetBSD builds.  Unless
     otherwise specified, these variables may be set in either the process
     environment or the make(1) configuration file specified by MAKECONF.

     BUILDID     Identifier for the build.  If set, this should be a short
                 string that is suitable for use as part of a file or
                 directory name.  The identifier will be appended to object
                 directory names, and can be consulted in the make(1)
                 configuration file in order to set additional build
                 parameters, such as compiler flags.  It will also be used as
                 part of the kernel version string, which can be printed by
                 "uname -v".

                 Default: Unset.

     BUILDINFO   This may be a multi-line string containing information about
                 the build.  This will appear in DESTDIR/etc/release, and it
                 will be stored in the buildinfo variable in any kernels that
                 are built.  When such kernels are booted, the sysctl(7)
                 kern.buildinfo variable will report this value.  The string
                 may contain backslash escape sequences, such as "\\"
                 (representing a backslash character) and "\n" (representing a
                 newline).

                 Default: Unset.

     BUILDSEED   GCC uses random numbers when compiling C++ code.  This
                 variable seeds the gcc random number generator using the
                 -frandom-seed flag with this value.  By default, it is set to
                 NetBSD-(majorversion).  Using a fixed value causes C++
                 binaries to be the same when built from the same sources,
                 resulting in identical (reproducible) builds.  Additional
                 information is available in the GCC documentation of
                 -frandom-seed.

     DESTDIR     Directory to contain the built NetBSD system.  If set,
                 special options are passed to the compilation tools to
                 prevent their default use of the host system's /usr/include,
                 /usr/lib, and so forth.  This pathname must be an absolute
                 path, and should not end with a slash (/) character.  (For
                 installation into the system's root directory, set DESTDIR to
                 an empty string, not to "/").  The directory must reside on a
                 file system which supports long file names and hard links.

                 Default: Empty string if USETOOLS is "yes"; unset otherwise.

                 Note: build.sh will provide a default of destdir.MACHINE (in
                 the top-level .OBJDIR) unless run in `expert' mode.

     EXTSRCSRCDIR
                 Directory containing sources of externally added programs and
                 libraries.  If specified, must be an absolute path.

                 Default: NETBSDRCDIR/../extsrc, if that exists; otherwise
                 /usr/extsrc.

     MAKECONF    The name of the make(1) configuration file.  Only settable in
                 the process environment.

                 Default: "/etc/mk.conf"

     MAKEVERBOSE
                 Level of verbosity of status messages.  Supported values:

                 0    No descriptive messages or commands executed by make(1)
                      are shown.

                 1    Brief messages are shown describing what is being done,
                      but the actual commands executed by make(1) are not
                      displayed.

                 2    Descriptive messages are shown as above (prefixed with a
                      `#'), and ordinary commands performed by make(1) are
                      displayed.

                 3    In addition to the above, all commands performed by
                      make(1) are displayed, even if they would ordinarily
                      have been hidden through use of the "@" prefix in the
                      relevant makefile.

                 4    In addition to the above, commands executed by make(1)
                      are traced through use of the sh(1) "-x" flag.

                 Default: 2

     MKCATPAGES  Can be set to "yes" or "no".  Indicates whether preformatted
                 plaintext manual pages will be created during a build.

                 Default: "no"

     MKCROSSGDB  Can be set to "yes" or "no".  Create a cross-gdb as a host
                 tool.

                 Default: "no"

     MKDEBUG     Can be set to "yes" or "no".  Indicates whether debug
                 information should be generated for all userland binaries
                 compiled.  The result is collected as an additional debug.tgz
                 and xdebug.tgz set and installed in /usr/libdata/debug.

                 Default: "no"

     MKDEBUGLIB  Can be set to "yes" or "no".  Indicates whether debug
                 information (see MKDEBUG) should also be generated for all
                 libraries build.

                 Default: "no"

     MKDOC       Can be set to "yes" or "no".  Indicates whether system
                 documentation destined for DESTDIR/usr/share/doc will be
                 installed during a build.

                 Default: "yes"

     MKEXTSRC    Can be set to "yes" or "no".  Indicates whether extsrc is
                 built from EXTSRCSRCDIR.

                 Default: "no"

     MKHTML      Can be set to "yes" or "no".  Indicates whether preformatted
                 HTML manual pages will be built and installed

                 Default: "yes"

     MKHOSTOBJ   Can be set to "yes" or "no".  If set to "yes", then for
                 programs intended to be run on the compile host, the name,
                 release, and architecture of the host operating system will
                 be suffixed to the name of the object directory created by
                 "make obj".  (This allows multiple host systems to compile
                 NetBSD for a single target.)  If set to "no", then programs
                 built to be run on the compile host will use the same object
                 directory names as programs built to be run on the target.

                 Default: "no"

     MKINFO      Can be set to "yes" or "no".  Indicates whether GNU Info
                 files, used for the documentation for most of the compilation
                 tools, will be created and installed during a build.

                 Default: "yes"

     MKKDEBUG    Can be set to "yes" or "no".  Force generation of full-debug
                 symbol versions of all kernels compiled.  Alongside of the
                 netbsd kernel file, an unstripped version netbsd.gdb is
                 created.  This is useful if a cross-gdb is built as well (see
                 MKCROSSGDB).

                 Default: "no"

     MKKMOD      Can be set to "yes" or "no".  Indicates whether kernel
                 modules are built and installed.

                 Default: "yes"

     MKLINT      Can be set to "yes" or "no".  Indicates whether lint(1) will
                 be run against portions of the NetBSD source code during the
                 build, and whether lint libraries will be installed into
                 DESTDIR/usr/libdata/lint.

                 Default: "yes"

     MKMAN       Can be set to "yes" or "no".  Indicates whether manual pages
                 will be installed during a build.

                 Default: "yes"

     MKNLS       Can be set to "yes" or "no".  Indicates whether Native
                 Language System locale zone files will be compiled and
                 installed during a build.

                 Default: "yes"

     MKOBJ       Can be set to "yes" or "no".  Indicates whether object
                 directories will be created when running "make obj".  If set
                 to "no", then all built files will be located inside the
                 regular source tree.

                 Default: "yes"

                 Note that setting MKOBJ to "no" is not recommended and may
                 cause problems when updating the tree with cvs(1).

     MKPIC       Can be set to "yes" or "no".  Indicates whether shared
                 objects and libraries will be created and installed during a
                 build.  If set to "no", the entire built system will be
                 statically linked.

                 Default: Platform dependent.  As of this writing, all
                 platforms except m68000 default to "yes".

     MKPICINSTALL
                 Can be set to "yes" or "no".  Indicates whether the ar(1)
                 format libraries (lib*_pic.a), used to generate shared
                 libraries, are installed during a build.

                 Default: "yes"

     MKPROFILE   Can be set to "yes" or "no".  Indicates whether profiled
                 libraries (lib*_p.a) will be built and installed during a
                 build.

                 Default: "yes"; however, some platforms turn off MKPROFILE by
                 default at times due to toolchain problems with profiled
                 code.

     MKREPRO     Can be set to "yes" or "no".  Create reproducible builds.
                 This enables different switches to make two builds from the
                 same source tree result in the same build results.

                 Default: "no" This may be set to "yes" by giving build.sh the
                 -P option.

     MKREPRO_TIMESTAMP
                 Unix timestamp.  When MKREPRO is set, the timestamp of all
                 files in the sets will be set to this value.

                 Default: Unset.  This may be set automatically to the latest
                 source tree timestamp using cvslatest(1) by giving build.sh
                 the -P option.

     MKSHARE     Can be set to "yes" or "no".  Indicates whether files
                 destined to reside in DESTDIR/usr/share will be built and
                 installed during a build.  If set to "no", then all of
                 MKCATPAGES, MKDOC, MKINFO, MKMAN, and MKNLS will be set to
                 "no" unconditionally.

                 Default: "yes"

     MKSTRIPIDENT
                 Can be set to "yes" or "no".  Indicates whether RCS IDs, for
                 use with ident(1), should be stripped from program binaries
                 and shared libraries.

                 Default: "no"

     MKSTRIPSYM  Can be set to "yes" or "no".  Indicates whether all local
                 symbols should be stripped from shared libraries.  If "yes",
                 strip all local symbols from shared libraries; the affect is
                 equivalent to the -x option of ld(1).  If "no", strip only
                 temporary local symbols; the affect is equivalent to the -X
                 option of ld(1).  Keeping non-temporary local symbols such as
                 static function names is useful on using DTrace for userland
                 libraries and getting a backtrace from a rump kernel loading
                 shared libraries.

                 Default: "yes"

     MKUNPRIVED  Can be set to "yes" or "no".  Indicates whether an
                 unprivileged install will occur.  The user, group,
                 permissions, and file flags, will not be set on the installed
                 items; instead the information will be appended to a file
                 called METALOG in DESTDIR.  The contents of METALOG are used
                 during the generation of the distribution tar files to ensure
                 that the appropriate file ownership is stored.

                 Default: "no"

     MKUPDATE    Can be set to "yes" or "no".  Indicates whether all install
                 operations intended to write to DESTDIR will compare file
                 timestamps before installing, and skip the install phase if
                 the destination files are up-to-date.  This also has
                 implications on full builds (see next subsection).

                 Default: "no"

     MKX11       Can be set to "yes" or "no".  Indicates whether X11 is built
                 from X11SRCDIR.

                 Default: "no"

     TOOLDIR     Directory to hold the host tools, once built.  If specified,
                 must be an absolute path.  This directory should be unique to
                 a given host system and NetBSD source tree.  (However,
                 multiple targets may share the same TOOLDIR; the target-
                 dependent files have unique names.)  If unset, a default
                 based on the uname(1) information of the host platform will
                 be created in the .OBJDIR of src.

                 Default: Unset.

     USETOOLS    Indicates whether the tools specified by TOOLDIR should be
                 used as part of a build in progress.  Must be set to "yes" if
                 cross-compiling.

                 yes    Use the tools from TOOLDIR.

                 no     Do not use the tools from TOOLDIR, but refuse to build
                        native compilation tool components that are version-
                        specific for that tool.

                 never  Do not use the tools from TOOLDIR, even when building
                        native tool components.  This is similar to the
                        traditional NetBSD build method, but does not verify
                        that the compilation tools in use are up-to-date
                        enough in order to build the tree successfully.  This
                        may cause build or runtime problems when building the
                        whole NetBSD source tree.

                 Default: "yes", unless TOOLCHAIN_MISSING is set to "yes".

                 USETOOLS is also set to "no" when using <bsd.*.mk> outside
                 the NetBSD source tree.

     X11SRCDIR   Directory containing the modular Xorg source.  If specified,
                 must be an absolute path.  The main modular Xorg source is
                 found in X11SRCDIR/external/mit.

                 Default: NETBSDRCDIR/../xsrc, if that exists; otherwise
                 /usr/xsrc.

   "make" variables for full builds
     These variables only affect the top level "Makefile" and do not affect
     manually building subtrees of the NetBSD source code.

     INSTALLWORLDDIR  Location for the "make installworld" target to install
                      to.  If specified, must be an absolute path.

                      Default: "/"

     MKOBJDIRS        Can be set to "yes" or "no".  Indicates whether object
                      directories will be created automatically (via a "make
                      obj" pass) at the start of a build.

                      Default: "no"

                      If using build.sh, the default is "yes".  This may be
                      set back to "no" by giving build.sh the -o option.

     MKUPDATE         Can be set to "yes" or "no".  If set, then in addition
                      to the effects described for MKUPDATE=yes above, this
                      implies the effects of NOCLEANDIR (i.e., "make cleandir"
                      is avoided).

                      Default: "no"

                      If using build.sh, this may be set by giving the -u
                      option.

     NBUILDJOBS       Now obsolete.  Use the make(1) option -j, instead.  See
                      below.

                      Default: Unset.

     NOCLEANDIR       If set, avoids the "make cleandir" phase of a full
                      build.  This has the effect of allowing only changed
                      files in a source tree to be recompiled.  This can speed
                      up builds when updating only a few files in the tree.

                      Default: Unset.

                      See also MKUPDATE.

     NODISTRIBDIRS    If set, avoids the "make distrib-dirs" phase of a full
                      build.  This skips running mtree(8) on DESTDIR, useful
                      on systems where building as an unprivileged user, or
                      where it is known that the system-wide mtree files have
                      not changed.

                      Default: Unset.

     NOINCLUDES       If set, avoids the "make includes" phase of a full
                      build.  This has the effect of preventing make(1) from
                      thinking that some programs are out-of-date simply
                      because the system include files have changed.  However,
                      this option should not be used when updating the entire
                      NetBSD source tree arbitrarily; it is suggested to use
                      MKUPDATE=yes instead in that case.

                      Default: Unset.

     RELEASEDIR       If set, specifies the directory to which a release(7)
                      layout will be written at the end of a "make release".
                      If specified, must be an absolute path.

                      Default: Unset.

                      Note: build.sh will provide a default of releasedir (in
                      the top-level .OBJDIR) unless run in `expert' mode.

BUILDING
   "make" command line options
     This is not a summary of all the options available to make(1); only the
     options used most frequently with NetBSD builds are listed here.

     -j njob    Run up to njob make(1) subjobs in parallel.  Makefiles should
                use .WAIT or have explicit dependencies as necessary to
                enforce build ordering.

     -m dir     Specify the default directory for searching for system
                Makefile segments, mainly the <bsd.*.mk> files.  When building
                any full NetBSD source tree, this should be set to the
                "share/mk" directory in the source tree.  This is set
                automatically when building from the top level, or when using
                build.sh.

     -n         Display the commands that would have been executed, but do not
                actually execute them.  This will still cause recursion to
                take place.

     -V var     Print make(1)'s idea of the value of var.  Does not build any
                targets.

     var=value  Set the variable var to value, overriding any setting
                specified by the process environment, the MAKECONF
                configuration file, or the system Makefile segments.

   "make" targets
     These default targets may be built by running make(1) in any subtree of
     the NetBSD source code.  It is recommended that none of these be used
     from the top level Makefile; as a specific exception, "make obj" and
     "make cleandir" are useful in that context.

     all        Build programs, libraries, and preformatted documentation.

     clean      Remove program and library object code files.

     cleandir   Same as clean, but also remove preformatted documentation,
                dependency files generated by "make depend", and any other
                files known to be created at build time.

     depend     Create dependency files (.depend) containing more detailed
                information about the dependencies of source code on header
                files.  Allows programs to be recompiled automatically when a
                dependency changes.

     dependall  Does a "make depend" immediately followed by a "make all".
                This improves cache locality of the build since both passes
                read the source files in their entirety.

     distclean  Synonym for cleandir.

     includes   Build and install system header files.  Typically needed
                before any system libraries or programs can be built.

     install    Install programs, libraries, and documentation into DESTDIR.
                Few files will be installed to DESTDIR/dev, DESTDIR/etc,
                DESTDIR/root or DESTDIR/var in order to prevent user supplied
                configuration data from being overwritten.

     lint       Run lint(1) against the C source code, where appropriate, and
                generate system-installed lint libraries.

     obj        Create object directories to be used for built files, instead
                of building directly in the source tree.

     tags       Create ctags(1) searchable function lists usable by the ex(1)
                and vi(1) text editors.

   "make" targets for the top level
     Additional make(1) targets are usable specifically from the top source
     level to facilitate building the entire NetBSD source tree.

     build         Build the entire NetBSD system (except the kernel).  This
                   orders portions of the source tree such that prerequisites
                   will be built in the proper order.

     distribution  Do a "make build", and then install a full distribution
                   (which does not include a kernel) into DESTDIR, including
                   files in DESTDIR/dev, DESTDIR/etc, DESTDIR/root and
                   DESTDIR/var.

     buildworld    As per "make distribution", except that it ensures that
                   DESTDIR is not the root directory.

     installworld  Install the distribution from DESTDIR to INSTALLWORLDDIR,
                   which defaults to the root directory.  Ensures that
                   INSTALLWORLDDIR is not the root directory if cross
                   compiling.

                   The INSTALLSETS environment variable may be set to a space-
                   separated list of distribution sets to be installed.  By
                   default, all sets except "etc" and "xetc" are installed, so
                   most files in INSTALLWORLDDIR/etc will not be installed or
                   modified.

                   Note: Before performing this operation with
                   INSTALLWORLDDIR=/, it is highly recommended that you
                   upgrade your kernel and reboot.  After performing this
                   operation, it is recommended that you use etcupdate(8) to
                   update files in INSTALLWORLDDIR/etc, and postinstall(8) to
                   check for or fix inconsistencies.

     sets          Create distribution sets from DESTDIR into
                   RELEASEDIR/RELEASEMACHINEDIR/binary/sets.  Should be run
                   after "make distribution", as "make build" alone does not
                   install all of the required files.

     sourcesets    Create source sets of the source tree into
                   RELEASEDIR/source/sets.

     syspkgs       Create syspkgs from DESTDIR into
                   RELEASEDIR/RELEASEMACHINEDIR/binary/syspkgs.  Should be run
                   after "make distribution", as "make build" alone does not
                   install all of the required files.

     release       Do a "make distribution", build kernels, distribution
                   media, and install sets (this as per "make sets"), and then
                   package the system into a standard release layout as
                   described by release(7).  This requires that RELEASEDIR be
                   set (see above).

     iso-image     Create a NetBSD installation CD-ROM image in the
                   RELEASEDIR/images directory.  The CD-ROM file system will
                   have a layout as described in release(7).

                   For most machine types, the CD-ROM will be bootable, and
                   will automatically run the sysinst(8) menu-based
                   installation program, which can be used to install or
                   upgrade a NetBSD system.  Bootable CD-ROMs also contain
                   tools that may be useful in repairing a damaged NetBSD
                   installation.

                   Before "make iso-image" is attempted, RELEASEDIR must be
                   populated by "make release" or equivalent.

                   Note that other, smaller, CD-ROM images may be created in
                   the RELEASEDIR/RELEASEMACHINEDIR/installation/cdrom
                   directory by "make release".  These smaller images usually
                   contain the same tools as the larger images in
                   RELEASEDIR/images, but do not contain additional content
                   such as the distribution sets.

                   Note that the mac68k port still uses an older method of
                   creating CD-ROM images.  This requires the mkisofs(1)
                   utility, which is not part of NetBSD, but which can be
                   installed from pkgsrc/sysutils/cdrtools.

     iso-image-source
                   Create a NetBSD installation CD-ROM image in the
                   RELEASEDIR/images directory.  The CD-ROM file system will
                   have a layout as described in release(7).  It will have top
                   level directories for the machine type and source.

                   For most machine types, the CD-ROM will be bootable, and
                   will automatically run the sysinst(8) menu-based
                   installation program, which can be used to install or
                   upgrade a NetBSD system.  Bootable CD-ROMs also contain
                   tools that may be useful in repairing a damaged NetBSD
                   installation.

                   Before "make iso-image-source" is attempted, RELEASEDIR
                   must be populated by "make sourcesets release" or
                   equivalent.

                   Note that other, smaller, CD-ROM images may be created in
                   the RELEASEDIR/RELEASEMACHINEDIR/installation/cdrom
                   directory by "make release".  These smaller images usually
                   contain the same tools as the larger images in
                   RELEASEDIR/images, but do not contain additional content
                   such as the distribution sets.

                   Note that the mac68k port still uses an older method of
                   creating CD-ROM images.  This requires the mkisofs(1)
                   utility, which is not part of NetBSD, but which can be
                   installed from pkgsrc/sysutils/cdrtools.

     install-image
                   Create a bootable NetBSD installation disk image in the
                   RELEASEDIR/images directory.  The installation disk image
                   is suitable for copying to bootable USB flash memory
                   sticks, etc., for machines which are able to boot from such
                   devices.  The file system in the bootable disk image will
                   have a layout as described in release(7).

                   The installation image is bootable, and will automatically
                   run the sysinst(8) menu-based installation program, which
                   can be used to install or upgrade a NetBSD system.  The
                   image also contains tools that may be useful in repairing a
                   damaged NetBSD installation.

                   Before "make install-image" is attempted, RELEASEDIR must
                   be populated by "make release" or equivalent.  The build
                   must have been performed with MKUNPRIVED=yes because "make
                   install-image" relies on information in DESTDIR/METALOG.

     live-image    Create NetBSD live images in the RELEASEDIR/images
                   directory.  The live image contains all necessary files to
                   boot NetBSD up to multi-user mode, including all files
                   which should be extracted during installation, NetBSD
                   disklabel, bootloaders, etc.

                   The live image is suitable for use as a disk image in
                   virtual machine environments such as QEMU, and also useful
                   to boot NetBSD from a USB flash memory stick on a real
                   machine, without the need for installation.

                   Before "make live-image" is attempted, RELEASEDIR must be
                   populated by "make release" or equivalent.  The build must
                   have been performed with MKUNPRIVED=yes because "make
                   install-image" relies on information in DESTDIR/METALOG.

     regression-tests
                   Can only be run after building the regression tests in the
                   directory "regress".  Runs those compiled regression tests
                   on the local host.  Note that most tests are now managed
                   instead using atf(7); this target should probably run those
                   as well but currently does not.

   The "build.sh" script
     This script file is a shell script designed to build the entire NetBSD
     system on any host with a suitable modern shell and some common
     utilities.  The required shell features are described under the HOST_SH
     variable.

     If a host system's default shell does support the required features, then
     we suggest that you explicitly specify a suitable shell using a command
     like

           /path/to/suitable/shell build.sh [options]

     The above command will usually enable build.sh to automatically set
     HOST_SH=/path/to/suitable/shell, but if that fails, then the following
     set of commands may be used instead:

           HOST_SH=/path/to/suitable/shell
           export HOST_SH
           ${HOST_SH} build.sh [options]

     If build.sh detects that it is being executed under an unsuitable shell,
     it attempts to exec a suitable shell instead, or prints an error message.
     If HOST_SH is not set explicitly, then build.sh sets a default using
     heuristics dependent on the host platform, or from the shell under which
     build.sh is executed (if that can be determined), or using the first copy
     of sh found in PATH.

     All cross-compile builds, and most native builds, of the entire system
     should make use of build.sh rather than just running "make".  This way,
     the make(1) program will be bootstrapped properly, in case the host
     system has an older or incompatible "make" program.

     When compiling the entire system via build.sh, many make(1) variables are
     set for you in order to help encapsulate the build process.  In the list
     of options below, variables that are automatically set by build.sh are
     noted where applicable.

     The following operations are supported by build.sh:

     build         Build the system as per "make build".  Before the main part
                   of the build commences, this command runs the obj operation
                   (unless the -o option is given), "make cleandir" (unless
                   the -u option is given), and the tools operation.

     distribution  Build a full distribution as per "make distribution".  This
                   command first runs the build operation.

     release       Build a full release as per "make release".  This command
                   first runs the distribution operation.

     makewrapper   Create the nbmake-MACHINE wrapper.  This operation is
                   automatically performed for any of the other operations.

     cleandir      Perform "make cleandir".

     obj           Perform "make obj".

     tools         Build and install the host tools from src/tools.  This
                   command will first run "make obj" and "make cleandir" in
                   the tools subdirectory unless the -o or -u options
                   (respectively) are given.

     install=idir  Install the contents of DESTDIR to idir, using "make
                   installworld".  Note that files that are part of the "etc"
                   or "xetc" sets will not be installed, unless overridden by
                   the INSTALLSETS environment variable.

     kernel=kconf  Build a new kernel.  The kconf argument is the name of a
                   configuration file suitable for use by config(1).  If kconf
                   does not contain any `/' characters, the configuration file
                   is expected to be found in the KERNCONFDIR directory, which
                   is typically sys/arch/MACHINE/conf.  The new kernel will be
                   built in a subdirectory of KERNOBJDIR, which is typically
                   sys/arch/MACHINE/compile or an associated object directory.

                   This command does not imply the tools command; run the
                   tools command first unless it is certain that the tools
                   already exist and are up to date.

                   This command will run "make cleandir" on the kernel in
                   question first unless the -u option is given.

     kernel.gdb=kconf
                   Build a new kernel with debug information.  Similar to the
                   above kernel=kconf operation, but creates a netbsd.gdb file
                   alongside of the kernel netbsd, which contains a full
                   symbol table and can be used for debugging (for example
                   with a cross-gdb built by MKCROSSGDB).

     kernels       This command will build all kernels defined in port
                   specific release build procedure.

                   This command internally calls the kernel=kconf operation
                   for each found kernel configuration file.

     modules       This command will build kernel modules and install them
                   into DESTDIR.

     releasekernel=kconf
                   Install a gzip(1)ed copy of the kernel previously built by
                   kernel=kconf into
                   RELEASEDIR/RELEASEMACHINEDIR/binary/kernel, usually as
                   netbsd-kconf.gz, although the "netbsd" prefix is determined
                   from the "config" directives in kconf.

     sets          Perform "make sets".

     sourcesets    Perform "make sourcesets".

     syspkgs       Perform "make syspkgs".

     iso-image     Perform "make iso-image".

     iso-image-source
                   Perform "make iso-image-source".

     install-image
                   Perform "make install-image".

     live-image    Perform "make live-image".

     list-arch     Prints a list of valid MACHINE and MACHINE_ARCH settings,
                   the default MACHINE_ARCH for each MACHINE, and aliases for
                   MACHINE/MACHINE_ARCH pairs, and then exits.  The -m or -a
                   options (or both) may be used to specify glob patterns that
                   will be used to narrow the list of results; for example,
                   "build.sh -m 'evm*' -a '*arm*' list-arch" will list all
                   known MACHINE/MACHINE_ARCH values in which either MACHINE
                   or ALIAS matches the pattern `evb*', and MACHINE_ARCH
                   matches the pattern `*arm*'.

     The following command line options alter the behaviour of the build.sh
     operations described above:

     -a arch   Set the value of MACHINE_ARCH to arch.  See the -m option for
               more information.

     -B buildid
               Set the value of BUILDID to buildid.  This will also append the
               build identifier to the name of the "make" wrapper script so
               that the resulting name is of the form
               "nbmake-MACHINE-BUILDID".

     -C cdextras
               Append cdextras to the CDEXTRA variable, which is a space-
               separated list of files or directories that will be added to
               the CD-ROM image that may be create by the "iso-image" or
               "iso-image-source" operations.  Files will be added to the root
               of the CD-ROM image, whereas directories will be copied
               recursively.  If relative paths are specified, they will be
               converted to absolute paths before being used.  Multiple paths
               may be specified via multiple -C options, or via a single
               option whose argument contains multiple space-separated paths.

     -D dest   Set the value of DESTDIR to dest.  If a relative path is
               specified, it will be converted to an absolute path before
               being used.

     -E        Set `expert' mode.  This overrides various sanity checks, and
               allows: DESTDIR does not have to be set to a non-root path for
               builds, and MKUNPRIVED=yes does not have to be set when
               building as a non-root user.

               Note: It is highly recommended that you know what you are doing
               when you use this option.

     -h        Print a help message.

     -j njob   Run up to njob make(1) subjobs in parallel; passed through to
               make(1).  If you see failures for reasons other than running
               out of memory while using build.sh with -j, please save
               complete build logs so the failures can be analyzed.

               To achieve the fastest builds, -j values between (1 + the
               number of CPUs) and (2 * the number of CPUs) are recommended.
               Use lower values on machines with limited memory or I/O
               bandwidth.

     -M obj    Set MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX to obj.  Unsets MAKEOBJDIR.  See "-O obj"
               for more information.

               For instance, if the source directory is /usr/src, a setting of
               "-M /usr/obj" will place build-time files under
               /usr/obj/usr/src/bin, /usr/obj/usr/src/lib,
               /usr/obj/usr/src/usr.bin, and so forth.

               If a relative path is specified, it will be converted to an
               absolute path before being used.  build.sh imposes the
               restriction that the argument to the -M option must not begin
               with a "$" (dollar sign) character; otherwise it would be too
               difficult to determine whether the value is an absolute or a
               relative path.  If the directory does not already exist,
               build.sh will create it.

     -m mach   Set the value of MACHINE to mach, unless the mach argument is
               an alias that refers to a MACHINE/MACHINE_ARCH pair, in which
               case both MACHINE and MACHINE_ARCH are set from the alias.
               Such aliases are interpreted entirely by build.sh; they are not
               used by any other part of the build system.  The MACHINE_ARCH
               setting implied by mach will override any value of MACHINE_ARCH
               in the process environment, but will not override a value set
               by the -a option.  All cross builds require -m, but if unset on
               a NetBSD host, the host's value of MACHINE will be detected and
               used automatically.

               See the list-arch operation for a way to get a list of valid
               MACHINE and MACHINE_ARCH settings.

     -N noiselevel
               Set the "noisyness" level of the build, by setting MAKEVERBOSE
               to noiselevel.

     -n        Show the commands that would be executed by build.sh, but do
               not make any changes.  This is similar in concept to "make -n".

     -O obj    Create an appropriate transform macro for MAKEOBJDIR that will
               place the built object files under obj.  Unsets
               MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX.

               For instance, a setting of "-O /usr/obj" will place build-time
               files under /usr/obj/bin, /usr/obj/lib, /usr/obj/usr.bin, and
               so forth.

               If a relative path is specified, it will be converted to an
               absolute path before being used.  build.sh imposes the
               restriction that the argument to the -O option must not contain
               a "$" (dollar sign) character.  If the directory does not
               already exist, build.sh will create it.

               In normal use, exactly one of the -M or -O options should be
               specified.  If neither -M nor -O is specified, then a default
               object directory will be chosen according to rules in
               <bsd.obj.mk>.  Relying on this default is not recommended
               because it is determined by complex rules that are influenced
               by the values of several variables and by the location of the
               source directory.

               Note that placing the obj directory location outside of the
               default source tree hierarchy makes it easier to manually clear
               out old files in the event the "make cleandir" operation is
               unable to do so.  (See CAVEATS below.)

               Note also that use of one of -M or -O is the only means of
               building multiple machine architecture userlands from the same
               source tree without cleaning between builds (in which case, one
               would specify distinct obj locations for each).

     -o        Set the value of MKOBJDIRS to "no".  Otherwise, it will be
               automatically set to "yes".  This default is opposite to the
               behaviour when not using build.sh.

     -R rel    Set the value of RELEASEDIR to rel.  If a relative path is
               specified, it will be converted to an absolute path before
               being used.

     -r        Remove the contents of DESTDIR and TOOLDIR before building
               (provides a clean starting point).  This will skip deleting
               DESTDIR if building on a native system to the root directory.

     -S seed   Change the value of BUILDSEED to seed.  This should rarely be
               necessary.

     -T tools  Set the value of TOOLDIR to tools.  If a relative path is
               specified, it will be converted to an absolute path before
               being used.  If set, the bootstrap "make" will only be rebuilt
               if the source files for make(1) have changed.

     -U        Set MKUNPRIVED=yes.

     -u        Set MKUPDATE=yes.

     -V var=[value]
               Set the environment variable var to an optional value.  This is
               propagated to the nbmake wrapper.

     -w wrapper
               Create the nbmake wrapper script (see below) in a custom
               location, specified by wrapper.  This allows, for instance, to
               place the wrapper in PATH automatically.  Note that wrapper is
               the full name of the file, not just a directory name.  If a
               relative path is specified, it will be converted to an absolute
               path before being used.

     -X x11src
               Set the value of X11SRCDIR to x11src.  If a relative path is
               specified, it will be converted to an absolute path before
               being used.

     -x        Set MKX11=yes.

     -Y extsrcdir
               Set the value of EXTSRCSRCDIR to extsrcdir.  If a relative path
               is specified, it will be converted to an absolute path before
               being used.

     -y        Set MKEXTSRC=yes.

     -Z var    Unset ("zap") the environment variable var.  This is propagated
               to the nbmake wrapper.

   The "nbmake-MACHINE" wrapper script
     If using the build.sh script to build NetBSD, a nbmake-MACHINE script
     will be created in TOOLDIR/bin upon the first build to assist in building
     subtrees on a cross-compile host.

     nbmake-MACHINE can be invoked in lieu of make(1), and will instead call
     the up-to-date version of "nbmake" installed into TOOLDIR/bin with
     several key variables pre-set, including MACHINE, MACHINE_ARCH, and
     TOOLDIR.  nbmake-MACHINE will also set variables specified with -V, and
     unset variables specified with -Z.

     This script can be symlinked into a directory listed in PATH, or called
     with an absolute path.

EXAMPLES
     1.   % ./build.sh [options] tools kernel=GENERIC

          Build a new toolchain, and use the new toolchain to configure and
          build a new GENERIC kernel.

     2.   % ./build.sh [options] -U distribution

          Using unprivileged mode, build a complete distribution to a DESTDIR
          directory that build.sh selects (and will display).

     3.   # ./build.sh [options] -U install=/

          As root, install to / the distribution that was built by example 2.
          Even though this is run as root, -U is required so that the
          permissions stored in DESTDIR/METALOG are correctly applied to the
          files as they're copied to /.

     4.   % ./build.sh [options] -U -u release

          Using unprivileged mode, build a complete release to DESTDIR and
          RELEASEDIR directories that build.sh selects (and will display).
          MKUPDATE=yes (-u) is set to prevent the "make cleandir", so that if
          this is run after example 2, it doesn't need to redo that portion of
          the release build.

OBSOLETE VARIABLES
     NBUILDJOBS  Use the make(1) option -j instead.

     USE_NEW_TOOLCHAIN
                 The new toolchain is now the default.  To disable, use
                 TOOLCHAIN_MISSING=yes.

HISTORY
     The build.sh based build scheme was introduced for NetBSD 1.6 as
     USE_NEW_TOOLCHAIN, and re-worked to TOOLCHAIN_MISSING after that.

CAVEATS
     After significant updates to third-party components in the source tree,
     the "make cleandir" operation may be insufficient to clean out old files
     in object directories.  Instead, one may have to manually remove the
     files.  Consult the UPDATING file for notices concerning this.
