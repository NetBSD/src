Introduction
************

   `grep' searches the input files for lines containing a match to a
given pattern list.  When it finds a match in a line, it copies the
line to standard output (by default), or does whatever other sort of
output you have requested with options.  `grep' expects to do the
matching on text.  Since newline is also a separator for the list of
patterns, there is no way to match newline characters in a text.

Invoking `grep'
***************

   `grep' comes with a rich set of options from POSIX.2 and GNU
extensions.

`-c'
`--count'
     Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching lines
     for each input file.  With the `-v', `--invert-match' option,
     count non-matching lines.

`-e PATTERN'
`--regexp=PATTERN'
     Use PATTERN as the pattern; useful to protect patterns beginning
     with a `-'.

`-f FILE'
`--file=FILE'
     Obtain patterns from FILE, one per line.  The empty file contains
     zero patterns, and therefore matches nothing.

`-i'
`--ignore-case'
     Ignore case distinctions in both the pattern and the input files.

`-l'
`--files-with-matches'
     Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input file
     from which output would normally have been printed.  The scanning
     of every file will stop on the first match.

`-n'
`--line-number'
     Prefix each line of output with the line number within its input
     file.

`-q'
`--quiet'
`--silent'
     Quiet; suppress normal output.  The scanning of every file will
     stop on the first match.  Also see the `-s' or `--no-messages'
     option.

`-s'
`--no-messages'
     Suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable files.
     Portability note: unlike GNU `grep', traditional `grep' did not
     conform to POSIX.2, because traditional `grep' lacked a `-q'
     option and its `-s' option behaved like GNU `grep''s `-q' option.
     Shell scripts intended to be portable to traditional `grep' should
     avoid both `-q' and `-s' and should redirect output to `/dev/null'
     instead.

`-v'
`--invert-match'
     Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.

`-x'
`--line-regexp'
     Select only those matches that exactly match the whole line.

GNU Extensions
==============

`-A NUM'
`--after-context=NUM'
     Print NUM lines of trailing context after matching lines.

`-B NUM'
`--before-context=NUM'
     Print NUM lines of leading context before matching lines.

`-C NUM'
`--context=[NUM]'
     Print NUM lines (default 2) of output context.

`-NUM'
     Same as `--context=NUM' lines of leading and trailing context.
     However, grep will never print any given line more than once.

`-V'
`--version'
     Print the version number of `grep' to the standard output stream.
     This version number should be included in all bug reports.

`--help'
     Print a usage message briefly summarizing these command-line
     options and the bug-reporting address, then exit.

`-b'
`--byte-offset'
     Print the byte offset within the input file before each line of
     output.  When `grep' runs on MS-DOS or MS-Windows, the printed
     byte offsets depend on whether the `-u' (`--unix-byte-offsets')
     option is used; see below.

`-d ACTION'
`--directories=ACTION'
     If an input file is a directory, use ACTION to process it.  By
     default, ACTION is `read', which means that directories are read
     just as if they were ordinary files (some operating systems and
     filesystems disallow this, and will cause `grep' to print error
     messages for every directory).  If ACTION is `skip', directories
     are silently skipped.  If ACTION is `recurse', `grep' reads all
     files under each directory, recursively; this is equivalent to the
     `-r' option.

`-H'
`-o'
`--with-filename'
     Print the filename for each match. '-o' has been added to NetBSD's
     grep for 4.4BSD compatibility.

`-h'
`--no-filename'
     Suppress the prefixing of filenames on output when multiple files
     are searched.

`-L'
`--files-without-match'
     Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input file
     from which no output would normally have been printed.  The
     scanning of every file will stop on the first match.

`-a'
`--text'
     Do not suppress output lines that contain binary data.  Normally,
     if the first few bytes of a file indicate that the file contains
     binary data, grep outputs only a message saying that the file
     matches the pattern.  This option causes grep to act as if the
     file is a text file, even if it would otherwise be treated as
     binary.  _Warning:_ the result might be binary garbage printed to
     the terminal, which can have nasty side-effects if the terminal
     driver interprets some of it as commands.

`-w'
`--word-regexp'
     Select only those lines containing matches that form whole words.
     The test is that the matching substring must either be at the
     beginning of the line, or preceded by a non-word constituent
     character.  Similarly, it must be either at the end of the line or
     followed by a non-word constituent character.  Word-constituent
     characters are letters, digits, and the underscore.

`-r'
`--recursive'
     For each directory mentioned in the command line, read and process
     all files in that directory, recursively.  This is the same as the
     `-d recurse' option.

`-y'
     Obsolete synonym for `-i'.

`-U'
`--binary'
     Treat the file(s) as binary.  By default, under MS-DOS and
     MS-Windows, `grep' guesses the file type by looking at the
     contents of the first 32kB read from the file.  If `grep' decides
     the file is a text file, it strips the `CR' characters from the
     original file contents (to make regular expressions with `^' and
     `$' work correctly).  Specifying `-U' overrules this guesswork,
     causing all files to be read and passed to the matching mechanism
     verbatim; if the file is a text file with `CR/LF' pairs at the end
     of each line, this will cause some regular expressions to fail.
     This option has no effect on platforms other than MS-DOS and
     MS-Windows.

`-u'
`--unix-byte-offsets'
     Report Unix-style byte offsets.  This switch causes `grep' to
     report byte offsets as if the file were Unix style text file,
     i.e., the byte offsets ignore the `CR' characters which were
     stripped.  This will produce results identical to running `grep' on
     a Unix machine.  This option has no effect unless `-b' option is
     also used; it has no effect on platforms other than MS-DOS and
     MS-Windows.

`--mmap'
     If possible, use the `mmap' system call to read input, instead of
     the default `read' system call.  In some situations, `--mmap'
     yields better performance.  However, `--mmap' can cause undefined
     behavior (including core dumps) if an input file shrinks while
     `grep' is operating, or if an I/O error occurs.

`-Z'
`--null'
     Output a zero byte (the ASCII `NUL' character) instead of the
     character that normally follows a file name.  For example, `grep
     -lZ' outputs a zero byte after each file name instead of the usual
     newline.  This option makes the output unambiguous, even in the
     presence of file names containing unusual characters like
     newlines.  This option can be used with commands like `find
     -print0', `perl -0', `sort -z', and `xargs -0' to process
     arbitrary file names, even those that contain newline characters.

`-z'
`--null-data'
     Treat the input as a set of lines, each terminated by a zero byte
     (the ASCII `NUL' character) instead of a newline.  Like the `-Z'
     or `--null' option, this option can be used with commands like
     `sort -z' to process arbitrary file names.

   Several additional options control which variant of the `grep'
matching engine is used.  *Note Grep Programs::.

Environment Variables
=====================

   Grep's behavior is affected by the following environment variables.

`GREP_OPTIONS'
     This variable specifies default options to be placed in front of
     any explicit options.  For example, if `GREP_OPTIONS' is `--text
     --directories=skip', `grep' behaves as if the two options `--text'
     and `--directories=skip' had been specified before any explicit
     options.  Option specifications are separated by whitespace.  A
     backslash escapes the next character, so it can be used to specify
     an option containing whitespace or a backslash.

`LC_ALL'
`LC_MESSAGES'
`LANG'
     These variables specify the `LC_MESSAGES' locale, which determines
     the language that `grep' uses for messages.  The locale is
     determined by the first of these variables that is set.  American
     English is used if none of these environment variables are set, or
     if the message catalog is not installed, or if `grep' was not
     compiled with national language support (NLS).

`LC_ALL'
`LC_CTYPE'
`LANG'
     These variables specify the `LC_CTYPE' locale, which determines the
     type of characters, e.g., which characters are whitespace.  The
     locale is determined by the first of these variables that is set.
     The POSIX locale is used if none of these environment variables
     are set, or if the locale catalog is not installed, or if `grep'
     was not compiled with national language support (NLS).

`POSIXLY_CORRECT'
     If set, `grep' behaves as POSIX.2 requires; otherwise, `grep'
     behaves more like other GNU programs.  POSIX.2 requires that
     options that follow file names must be treated as file names; by
     default, such options are permuted to the front of the operand
     list and are treated as options.  Also, POSIX.2 requires that
     unrecognized options be diagnosed as "illegal", but since they are
     not really against the law the default is to diagnose them as
     "invalid".  `POSIXLY_CORRECT' also disables
     `_N_GNU_nonoption_argv_flags_', described below.

`_N_GNU_nonoption_argv_flags_'
     (Here `N' is `grep''s numeric process ID.)  If the Ith character
     of this environment variable's value is `1', do not consider the
     Ith operand of `grep' to be an option, even if it appears to be
     one.  A shell can put this variable in the environment for each
     command it runs, specifying which operands are the results of file
     name wildcard expansion and therefore should not be treated as
     options.  This behavior is available only with the GNU C library,
     and only when `POSIXLY_CORRECT' is not set.

Diagnostics
***********

   Normally, exit status is 0 if matches were found, and 1 if no matches
were found (the `-v' option inverts the sense of the exit status).
Exit status is 2 if there were syntax errors in the pattern,
inaccessible input files, or other system errors.

`grep' programs
***************

   `grep' searches the named input files (or standard input if no files
are named, or the file name `-' is given) for lines containing a match
to the given pattern.  By default, `grep' prints the matching lines.
There are three major variants of `grep', controlled by the following
options.

`-G'
`--basic-regexp'
     Interpret pattern as a basic regular expression.  This is the
     default.

`-E'
`--extended-regexp'
     Interpret pattern as an extended regular expression.

`-F'
`--fixed-strings'
     Interpret pattern as a list of fixed strings, separated by
     newlines, any of which is to be matched.

   In addition, two variant programs EGREP and FGREP are available.
EGREP is the same as `grep -E'.  FGREP is the same as `grep -F'.


File: grep.info,  Node: Regular Expressions,  Next: Usage,  Prev: Grep Programs,  Up: Top

Regular Expressions
*******************

   A "regular expression" is a pattern that describes a set of strings.
Regular expressions are constructed analogously to arithmetic
expressions, by using various operators to combine smaller expressions.
`grep' understands two different versions of regular expression syntax:
"basic" and "extended".  In GNU `grep', there is no difference in
available functionality using either syntax.  In other implementations,
basic regular expressions are less powerful.  The following description
applies to extended regular expressions; differences for basic regular
expressions are summarized afterwards.

   The fundamental building blocks are the regular expressions that
match a single character.  Most characters, including all letters and
digits, are regular expressions that match themselves.  Any
metacharacter with special meaning may be quoted by preceding it with a
backslash.  A list of characters enclosed by `[' and `]' matches any
single character in that list; if the first character of the list is the
caret `^', then it matches any character *not* in the list.  For
example, the regular expression `[0123456789]' matches any single digit.
A range of ASCII characters may be specified by giving the first and
last characters, separated by a hyphen.

   Finally, certain named classes of characters are predefined, as
follows.  Their interpretation depends on the `LC_CTYPE' locale; the
interpretation below is that of the POSIX locale, which is the default
if no `LC_CTYPE' locale is specified.

`[:alnum:]'
     Any of `[:digit:]' or `[:alpha:]'

`[:alpha:]'
     Any letter:
     `a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z',
     `A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z'.

`[:blank:]'
     Space or tab.

`[:cntrl:]'
     Any character with octal codes 000 through 037, or `DEL' (octal
     code 177).

`[:digit:]'
     Any one of `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9'.

`[:graph:]'
     Anything that is not a `[:alnum:]' or `[:punct:]'.

`[:lower:]'
     Any one of `a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z'.

`[:print:]'
     Any character from the `[:space:]' class, and any character that is
     *not* in the `[:graph:]' class.

`[:punct:]'
     Any one of `! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? @ [ \ ] ^ _
     ` { | } ~'.

`[:space:]'
     Any one of `CR FF HT NL VT SPACE'.

`[:upper:]'
     Any one of `A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z'.

`[:xdigit:]'
     Any one of `a b c d e f A B C D E F 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9'.

   For example, `[[:alnum:]]' means `[0-9A-Za-z]', except the latter
form is dependent upon the ASCII character encoding, whereas the former
is portable.  (Note that the brackets in these class names are part of
the symbolic names, and must be included in addition to the brackets
delimiting the bracket list.)  Most metacharacters lose their special
meaning inside lists.  To include a literal `]', place it first in the
list.  Similarly, to include a literal `^', place it anywhere but
first.  Finally, to include a literal `-', place it last.

   The period `.' matches any single character.  The symbol `\w' is a
synonym for `[[:alnum:]]' and `\W' is a synonym for `[^[:alnum]]'.

   The caret `^' and the dollar sign `$' are metacharacters that
respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a line.
The symbols `\<' and `\>' respectively match the empty string at the
beginning and end of a word.  The symbol `\b' matches the empty string
at the edge of a word, and `\B' matches the empty string provided it's
not at the edge of a word.

   A regular expression may be followed by one of several repetition
operators:

`?'
     The preceding item is optional and will be matched at most once.

`*'
     The preceding item will be matched zero or more times.

`+'
     The preceding item will be matched one or more times.

`{N}'
     The preceding item is matched exactly N times.

`{N,}'
     The preceding item is matched n or more times.

`{N,M}'
     The preceding item is matched at least N times, but not more than
     M times.

   Two regular expressions may be concatenated; the resulting regular
expression matches any string formed by concatenating two substrings
that respectively match the concatenated subexpressions.

   Two regular expressions may be joined by the infix operator `|'; the
resulting regular expression matches any string matching either
subexpression.

   Repetition takes precedence over concatenation, which in turn takes
precedence over alternation.  A whole subexpression may be enclosed in
parentheses to override these precedence rules.

   The backreference `\N', where N is a single digit, matches the
substring previously matched by the Nth parenthesized subexpression of
the regular expression.

   In basic regular expressions the metacharacters `?', `+', `{', `|',
`(', and `)' lose their special meaning; instead use the backslashed
versions `\?', `\+', `\{', `\|', `\(', and `\)'.

   Traditional `egrep' did not support the `{' metacharacter, and some
`egrep' implementations support `\{' instead, so portable scripts
should avoid `{' in `egrep' patterns and should use `[{]' to match a
literal `{'.

   GNU `egrep' attempts to support traditional usage by assuming that
`{' is not special if it would be the start of an invalid interval
specification.  For example, the shell command `egrep '{1'' searches
for the two-character string `{1' instead of reporting a syntax error
in the regular expression.  POSIX.2 allows this behavior as an
extension, but portable scripts should avoid it.

Usage
*****

   Here is an example shell command that invokes GNU `grep':

     grep -i 'hello.*world' menu.h main.c

This lists all lines in the files `menu.h' and `main.c' that contain
the string `hello' followed by the string `world'; this is because `.*'
matches zero or more characters within a line.  *Note Regular
Expressions::.  The `-i' option causes `grep' to ignore case, causing
it to match the line `Hello, world!', which it would not otherwise
match.  *Note Invoking::, for more details about how to invoke `grep'.

   Here are some common questions and answers about `grep' usage.

  1. How can I list just the names of matching files?

          grep -l 'main' *.c

     lists the names of all C files in the current directory whose
     contents mention `main'.

  2. How do I search directories recursively?

          grep -r 'hello' /home/gigi

     searches for `hello' in all files under the directory
     `/home/gigi'.  For more control of which files are searched, use
     `find', `grep' and `xargs'.  For example, the following command
     searches only C files:

          find /home/gigi -name '*.c' -print | xargs grep 'hello' /dev/null

  3. What if a pattern has a leading `-'?

          grep -e '--cut here--' *

     searches for all lines matching `--cut here--'.  Without `-e',
     `grep' would attempt to parse `--cut here--' as a list of options.

  4. Suppose I want to search for a whole word, not a part of a word?

          grep -w 'hello' *

     searches only for instances of `hello' that are entire words; it
     does not match `Othello'.  For more control, use `\<' and `\>' to
     match the start and end of words.  For example:

          grep 'hello\>' *

     searches only for words ending in `hello', so it matches the word
     `Othello'.

  5. How do I output context around the matching lines?

          grep -C 2 'hello' *

     prints two lines of context around each matching line.

  6. How do I force grep to print the name of the file?

     Append `/dev/null':

          grep 'eli' /etc/passwd /dev/null

  7. Why do people use strange regular expressions on `ps' output?

          ps -ef | grep '[c]ron'

     If the pattern had been written without the square brackets, it
     would have matched not only the `ps' output line for `cron', but
     also the `ps' output line for `grep'.

  8. Why does `grep' report "Binary file matches"?

     If `grep' listed all matching "lines" from a binary file, it would
     probably generate output that is not useful, and it might even
     muck up your display.  So GNU `grep' suppresses output from files
     that appear to be binary files.  To force GNU `grep' to output
     lines even from files that appear to be binary, use the `-a' or
     `--text' option.

  9. Why doesn't `grep -lv' print nonmatching file names?

     `grep -lv' lists the names of all files containing one or more
     lines that do not match.  To list the names of all files that
     contain no matching lines, use the `-L' or `--files-without-match'
     option.

 10. I can do OR with `|', but what about AND?

          grep 'paul' /etc/motd | grep 'franc,ois'

     finds all lines that contain both `paul' and `franc,ois'.

 11. How can I search in both standard input and in files?

     Use the special file name `-':

          cat /etc/passwd | grep 'alain' - /etc/motd

Reporting bugs
**************

   Email bug reports to <bug-gnu-utils@gnu.org>.  Be sure to include
the word "grep" somewhere in the "Subject:" field.

   Large repetition counts in the `{m,n}' construct may cause `grep' to
use lots of memory.  In addition, certain other obscure regular
expressions require exponential time and space, and may cause grep to
run out of memory.  Backreferences are very slow, and may require
exponential time.
