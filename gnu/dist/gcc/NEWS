   GCC used to stand for the GNU C Compiler, but since the compiler
   supports several other languages aside from C, it now stands for the
   GNU Compiler Collection.

   A list of [8]successful builds is updated as new information becomes
   available.

   The GCC developers would like to thank the numerous people that have
   contributed new features, improvements, bug fixes, and other changes
   as well as test results to GCC. This [9]amazing group of volunteers is
   what makes GCC successful.

                           GCC 3.3 Release Series
                      Changes, New Features, and Fixes

   The latest release in the 3.3 release series is [1]GCC 3.3.3.

Caveats

     * The preprocessor no longer accepts multi-line string literals.
       They were deprecated in 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2.
     * The preprocessor no longer supports the -A- switch when appearing
       alone. -A- followed by an assertion is still supported.
     * Support for all the systems [2]obsoleted in GCC 3.1 has been
       removed from GCC 3.3. See below for a [3]list of systems which are
       obsoleted in this release.
     * Checking for null format arguments has been decoupled from the
       rest of the format checking mechanism. Programs which use the
       format attribute may regain this functionality by using the new
       [4]nonnull function attribute. Note that all functions for which
       GCC has a built-in format attribute, an appropriate built-in
       nonnull attribute is also applied.
     * The DWARF (version 1) debugging format has been deprecated and
       will be removed in a future version of GCC. Version 2 of the DWARF
       debugging format will continue to be supported for the foreseeable
       future.
     * The C and Objective-C compilers no longer accept the "Naming
       Types" extension (typedef foo = bar); it was already unavailable
       in C++. Code which uses it will need to be changed to use the
       "typeof" extension instead: typedef typeof(bar) foo. (We have
       removed this extension without a period of deprecation because it
       has caused the compiler to crash since version 3.0 and no one
       noticed until very recently. Thus we conclude it is not in
       widespread use.)
     * The -traditional C compiler option has been removed. It was
       deprecated in 3.1 and 3.2. (Traditional preprocessing remains
       available.) The <varargs.h> header, used for writing variadic
       functions in traditional C, still exists but will produce an error
       message if used.
     * GCC 3.3.1 automatically places zero-initialized variables in the
       .bss section on some operating systems. Versions of GNU Emacs up
       to (and including) 21.3 will not work correctly when using this
       optimization; you can use -fno-zero-initialized-in-bss to disable
       it.

General Optimizer Improvements

     * A new scheme for accurately describing processor pipelines, the
       [5]DFA scheduler, has been added.
     * Pavel Nejedly, Charles University Prague, has contributed new file
       format used by the edge coverage profiler (-fprofile-arcs).
       The new format is robust and diagnoses common mistakes where
       profiles from different versions (or compilations) of the program
       are combined resulting in nonsensical profiles and slow code to
       produced with profile feedback. Additionally this format allows
       extra data to be gathered. Currently, overall statistics are
       produced helping optimizers to identify hot spots of a program
       globally replacing the old intra-procedural scheme and resulting
       in better code. Note that the gcov tool from older GCC versions
       will not be able to parse the profiles generated by GCC 3.3 and
       vice versa.
     * Jan Hubicka, SuSE Labs, has contributed a new superblock formation
       pass enabled using -ftracer. This pass simplifies the control flow
       of functions allowing other optimizations to do better job.
       He also contributed the function reordering pass
       (-freorder-functions) to optimize function placement using profile
       feedback.

New Languages and Language specific improvements

  C/ObjC/C++

     * The preprocessor now accepts directives within macro arguments. It
       processes them just as if they had not been within macro
       arguments.
     * The separate ISO and traditional preprocessors have been
       completely removed. The front end handles either type of
       preprocessed output if necessary.
     * In C99 mode preprocessor arithmetic is done in the precision of
       the target's intmax_t, as required by that standard.
     * The preprocessor can now copy comments inside macros to the output
       file when the macro is expanded. This feature, enabled using the
       -CC option, is intended for use by applications which place
       metadata or directives inside comments, such as lint.
     * The method of constructing the list of directories to be searched
       for header files has been revised. If a directory named by a -I
       option is a standard system include directory, the option is
       ignored to ensure that the default search order for system
       directories and the special treatment of system header files are
       not defeated.
     * A few more [6]ISO C99 features now work correctly.
     * A new function attribute, nonnull, has been added which allows
       pointer arguments to functions to be specified as requiring a
       non-null value. The compiler currently uses this information to
       issue a warning when it detects a null value passed in such an
       argument slot.
     * A new type attribute, may_alias, has been added. Accesses to
       objects with types with this attribute are not subjected to
       type-based alias analysis, but are instead assumed to be able to
       alias any other type of objects, just like the char type.

  C++

     * Type based alias analysis has been implemented for C++ aggregate
       types.

  Objective-C

     * Generate an error if Objective-C objects are passed by value in
       function and method calls.
     * When -Wselector is used, check the whole list of selectors at the
       end of compilation, and emit a warning if a @selector() is not
       known.
     * Define __NEXT_RUNTIME__ when compiling for the NeXT runtime.
     * No longer need to include objc/objc-class.h to compile self calls
       in class methods (NeXT runtime only).
     * New -Wundeclared-selector option.
     * Removed selector bloating which was causing object files to be 10%
       bigger on average (GNU runtime only).
     * Using at run time @protocol() objects has been fixed in certain
       situations (GNU runtime only).
     * Type checking has been fixed and improved in many situations
       involving protocols.

  Java

     * The java.sql and javax.sql packages now implement the JDBC 3.0
       (JDK 1.4) API.
     * The JDK 1.4 assert facility has been implemented.
     * The bytecode interpreter is now direct threaded and thus faster.

  Fortran

     * Fortran improvements are listed in [7]the Fortran documentation.

  Ada

     * Ada tasking now works with glibc 2.3.x threading libraries.

New Targets and Target Specific Improvements

     * The following changes have been made to the HP-PA port:
          + The port now defaults to scheduling for the PA8000 series of
            processors.
          + Scheduling support for the PA7300 processor has been added.
          + The 32-bit port now supports weak symbols under HP-UX 11.
          + The handling of initializers and finalizers has been improved
            under HP-UX 11. The 64-bit port no longer uses collect2.
          + Dwarf2 EH support has been added to the 32-bit linux port.
          + ABI fixes to correct the passing of small structures by
            value.
     * The SPARC, HP-PA, SH4, and x86/pentium ports have been converted
       to use the DFA processor pipeline description.
     * The following NetBSD configurations for the SuperH processor
       family have been added:
          + SH3, big-endian, sh-*-netbsdelf*
          + SH3, little-endian, shle-*-netbsdelf*
          + SH5, SHmedia, big-endian, 32-bit default, sh5-*-netbsd*
          + SH5, SHmedia, little-endian, 32-bit default, sh5le-*-netbsd*
          + SH5, SHmedia, big-endian, 64-bit default, sh64-*-netbsd*
          + SH5, SHmedia, little-endian, 64-bit default, sh64le-*-netbsd*
     * The following changes have been made to the IA-32/x86-64 port:
          + SSE2 and 3dNOW! intrinsics are now supported.
          + Support for thread local storage has been added to the IA-32
            and x86-64 ports.
          + The x86-64 port has been significantly improved.
     * The following changes have been made to the MIPS port:
          + All configurations now accept the -mabi switch. Note that you
            will need appropriate multilibs for this option to work
            properly.
          + ELF configurations will always pass an ABI flag to the
            assembler, except when the MIPS EABI is selected.
          + -mabi=64 no longer selects MIPS IV code.
          + The -mcpu option, which was deprecated in 3.1 and 3.2, has
            been removed from this release.
          + -march now changes the core ISA level. In previous releases,
            it would change the use of processor-specific extensions, but
            would leave the core ISA unchanged. For example, mips64-elf
            -march=r8000 will now generate MIPS IV code.
          + Under most configurations, -mipsN now acts as a synonym for
            -march.
          + There are some new preprocessor macros to describe the -march
            and -mtune settings. See the documentation of those options
            for details.
          + Support for the NEC VR-Series processors has been added. This
            includes the 54xx, 5500, and 41xx series.
          + Support for the Sandcraft sr71k processor has been added.
     * The following changes have been made to the S/390 port:
          + Support to build the Java runtime libraries has been added.
            Java is now enabled by default on s390-*-linux* and
            s390x-*-linux* targets.
          + Multilib support for the s390x-*-linux* target has been
            added; this allows to build 31-bit binaries using the -m31
            option.
          + Support for thread local storage has been added.
          + Inline assembler code may now use the 'Q' constraint to
            specify memory operands without index register.
          + Various platform-specific performance improvements have been
            implemented; in particular, the compiler now uses the BRANCH
            ON COUNT family of instructions and makes more frequent use
            of the TEST UNDER MASK family of instructions.
     * The following changes have been made to the PowerPC port:
          + Support for IBM Power4 processor added.
          + Support for Motorola e500 SPE added.
          + Support for AIX 5.2 added.
          + Function and Data sections now supported on AIX.
          + Sibcall optimizations added.
     * The support for H8 Tiny is added to the H8/300 port with -mn.

Documentation improvements

Other significant improvements

     * Almost all front-end dependencies in the compiler have been
       separated out into a set of language hooks. This should make
       adding a new front end clearer and easier.
     * One effect of removing the separate preprocessor is a small
       increase in the robustness of the compiler in general, and the
       maintainability of target descriptions. Previously target-specific
       built-in macros and others, such as __FAST_MATH__, had to be
       handled with so-called specs that were hard to maintain. Often
       they would fail to behave properly when conflicting options were
       supplied on the command line, and define macros in the user's
       namespace even when strict ISO compliance was requested.
       Integrating the preprocessor has cleanly solved these issues.
     * The Makefile suite now supports redirection of make install by
       means of the variable DESTDIR.

                           GCC 3.2 Release Series

   April 25, 2003

   The [1]GNU project and the GCC developers are pleased to announce the
   release of GCC 3.2.3.

   The purpose of the GCC 3.2 release series is to provide a stable
   platform for OS distributors to use building their next releases. A
   primary objective was to stabilize the C++ ABI; we believe that the
   interface to the compiler and the C++ standard library are now
   relatively stable.

   Be aware that C++ code compiled by GCC 3.2.x will (in general) not
   interoperate with code compiled by GCC 3.1.1 or earlier.

   Please refer to our [2]detailed list of news, caveats, and bug-fixes
   for further information.

References and Acknowledgements

   GCC used to stand for the GNU C Compiler, but since the compiler
   supports several other languages aside from C, it now stands for the
   GNU Compiler Collection.

   A list of [7]successful builds is updated as new information becomes
   available.

   The GCC developers would like to thank the numerous people that have
   contributed new features, improvements, bug fixes, and other changes
   as well as test results to GCC. This [8]amazing group of volunteers is
   what makes GCC successful.

   For additional information about GCC please refer to the [9]GCC
   project web site or contact the [10]GCC development mailing list.

   To obtain GCC please use [11]our mirror sites, one of the [12]GNU
   mirror sites, or [13]our CVS server.

                           GCC 3.2 Release Series
                      Changes, New Features, and Fixes

   The latest release in the 3.2 release series is [1]GCC 3.2.3.

Caveats and New Features

  Caveats

     * The C++ compiler does not correctly zero-initialize
       pointers-to-data members. You must explicitly initialize them. For
       example: int S::*m(0); will work, but depending on
       default-initialization to zero will not work. This bug cannot be
       fixed in GCC 3.2 without inducing unacceptable risks. It will be
       fixed in GCC 3.3.
     * This GCC release is based on the GCC 3.1 sourcebase, and thus has
       all the [2]changes in the GCC 3.1 series. In addition, GCC 3.2 has
       a number of C++ ABI fixes which make its C++ compiler generate
       binary code which is incompatible with the C++ compilers found in
       earlier GCC releases, including GCC 3.1 and GCC 3.1.1.

  Frontend Enhancements

    C/C++/Objective-C

     * The method of constructing the list of directories to be searched
       for header files has been revised. If a directory named by a -I
       option is a standard system include directory, the option is
       ignored to ensure that the default search order for system
       directories and the special treatment of system header files are
       not defeated.
     * The C and Objective-C compilers no longer accept the "Naming
       Types" extension (typedef foo = bar); it was already unavailable
       in C++. Code which uses it will need to be changed to use the
       "typeof" extension instead: typedef typeof(bar) foo. (We have
       removed this extension without a period of deprecation because it
       has caused the compiler to crash since version 3.0 and no one
       noticed until very recently. Thus we conclude it is not in
       widespread use.)

    C++

     * GCC 3.2 fixed serveral differences between the C++ ABI implemented
       in GCC and the multi-vendor standard, but more have been found
       since the release. 3.2.1 adds a new warning, -Wabi, to warn about
       code which is affected by these bugs. We will fix these bugs in
       some future release, once we are confident that all have been
       found; until then, it is our intention to make changes to the ABI
       only if they are necessary for correct compilation of C++, as
       opposed to conformance to the ABI documents.
     * For details on how to build an ABI compliant compiler for
       GNU/Linux systems, check the [3]common C++ ABI page.

  New Targets and Target Specific Improvements

    IA-32

     * Fixed a number of bugs in SSE and MMX intrinsics.
     * Fixed common compiler crashes with SSE instruction set enabled
       (implied by -march=pentium3, pentium4, athlon-xp)
     * __m128 and __m128i is not 128bit aligned when used in structures.

    x86-64

     * A bug whereby the compiler could generate bad code for bzero has
       been fixed.
     * ABI fixes (implying ABI incompatibilities with previous version in
       some corner cases)
     * Fixed prefetch code generation
     _________________________________________________________________

GCC 3.2.3

   3.2.3 is a bug fix release only; there are no new features that were
   not present in GCC 3.2.2.

  Bug Fixes

   This section lists the problem reports (PRs) from GCC's bug tracking
   system that are known to be fixed in the 3.2.3 release. This list
   might not be complete (that is, it is possible that some PRs that have
   been fixed are not listed here), and some of the titles have been
   changed to make them more clear.

    Internal Compiler Errors (multi-platform)

     * [4]3782: (c++) -quiet -fstats produces a segmentation fault in
       cc1plus
     * [5]6440: (c++) template specializations cause ICE
     * [6]7050: (c++) ICE on: (i ? get_string() : throw)
     * [7]7741: ICE on conflicting types (make_decl_rtl in varasm.c)
     * [8]7982: (c++) ICE due to infinite recursion (using STL set)
     * [9]8068: exceedingly high (infinite) memory usage
     * [10]8178: ICE with __builtin_ffs
     * [11]8396: ICE in copy_to_mode_reg, in explow.c
     * [12]8674: (c++) ICE in cp_expr_size, in cp/cp-lang.c
     * [13]9768: ICE when optimizing inline code at -O2
     * [14]9798: (c++) Infinite recursion (segfault) in
       cp/decl.c:push_using_directive with recursive using directives

GCC 3.2.2

   Beginning with 3.2.2, GCC's Makefile suite supports redirection of
   make install by means of the DESTDIR variable. Parts of the GCC tree
   have featured that support long before, but now it is available even
   from the top level.

   Other than that, GCC 3.2.2 is a bug fix release only; there are no new
   features that were not present in GCC 3.2.1.

  Bug Fixes

   On the following i386-based systems GCC 3.2.1 broke the C ABI wrt.
   functions returning structures: Cygwin, FreeBSD (GCC 3.2.1 as shipped
   with FreeBSD 5.0 does not have this problem), Interix, a.out-based
   Linux and NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Darwin. GCC 3.2.2 reverts this ABI
   change, and thus restores ABI-compatibility with previous releases
   (except GCC 3.2.1) on these platforms.

   This section lists the problem reports (PRs) from GCC's bug tracking
   system that are known to be fixed in the 3.2.2 release. This list
   might not be complete (that is, it is possible that some PRs that have
   been fixed are not listed here) and some of the titles have been
   changed to make them more clear.

GCC 3.2.1

   3.2.1 adds a new warning, -Wabi. This option warns when GNU C++
   generates code that is known not to be binary-compatible with the
   vendor-neutral ia32/ia64 ABI. Please consult the GCC manual, included
   in the distribution, for details.

   This release also removes an old GCC extension, "naming types", and
   the documentation now directs users to use a different GCC extension,
   __typeof__, instead. The feature had evidently been broken for a
   while.

   Otherwise, 3.2.1 is a bug fix release only; other than bug fixes and
   the new warning there are no new features that were not present in GCC
   3.2.

   In addition, the previous fix for [128]PR 7445 (poor performance of
   std::locale::classic() in multi-threaded applications) was reverted
   ("unfixed"), because the "fix" was not thread-safe.

  Bug Fixes

   This section lists the problem reports (PRs) from GCC's bug tracking
   system that are known to be fixed in the 3.2.1 release. This list
   might not be complete (that is, it is possible that some PRs that have
   been fixed are not listed here). As you can see, the number of bug
   fixes is quite large, so it is strongly recommended that users of
   earlier GCC 3.x releases upgrade to GCC 3.2.1.

GCC 3.2

   3.2 is a small bug fix release, but there is a change to the
   application binary interface (ABI), hence the change to the second
   part of the version number.

   The main purpose of the 3.2 release is to correct a couple of problems
   in the C++ ABI, with the intention of providing a stable interface
   going forward.  Accordingly, 3.2 is only a small change to 3.1.1.

                                  GCC 3.1

   July 27, 2002

   The [1]GNU project and the GCC developers are pleased to announce the
   release of GCC 3.1.1.

   The links below still apply to GCC 3.1.1.

   May 15, 2002

   The [2]GNU project and the GCC developers are pleased to announce the
   release of GCC 3.1.

   GCC used to stand for the GNU C Compiler, but since the compiler
   supports several other languages aside from C, it now stands for the
   GNU Compiler Collection.

   A list of [3]successful builds is updated as new information becomes
   available.

   The GCC developers would like to thank the numerous people that have
   contributed [4]new features, improvements, bug fixes, and other
   changes as well as test results to GCC. This [5]amazing group of
   volunteers is what makes GCC successful.

   For additional information about GCC please refer to the [6]GCC
   project web site or contact the [7]GCC development mailing list.

   To obtain GCC please use [8]our mirror sites, one of the [9]GNU mirror
   sites, or [10]our CVS server.

                           GCC 3.1 Release Series
                      Changes, New Features, and Fixes

Additional changes in GCC 3.1.1

     * A bug related to how structures and unions are returned has been
       fixed for powerpc-*-netbsd*.
     * An important bug in the implementation of -fprefetch-loop-arrays
       has been fixed. Previously the optimization prefetched random
       blocks of memory for most targets except for i386.
     * The Java compiler now compiles Java programs much faster and also
       works with parallel make.
     * Nested functions have been fixed for mips*-*-netbsd*.
     * Some missing floating point support routines have beed added for
       mips*-*-netbsd*.
     * This [1]message gives additional information about the bugs fixed
       in this release.

Caveats

     * The -traditional C compiler option has been deprecated and will be
       removed in GCC 3.3. (It remains possible to preprocess non-C code
       with the traditional preprocessor.)
     * The default debugging format for most ELF platforms (including
       GNU/Linux and FreeBSD; notable exception is Solaris) has changed
       from stabs to DWARF2. This requires GDB 5.1.1 or later.

General Optimizer Improvements

     * Jan Hubicka, SuSE Labs, together with Richard Henderson, Red Hat,
       and Andreas Jaeger, SuSE Labs, has contributed [2]infrastructure
       for profile driven optimizations.
       Options -fprofile-arcs and -fbranch-probabilities can now be used
       to improve speed of the generated code by profiling the actual
       program behaviour on typical runs. In the absence of profile info
       the compiler attempts to guess the profile statically.
     * [3]SPEC2000 and SPEC95 benchmark suites are now used daily to
       monitor performance of the generated code.
       According to the SPECInt2000 results on an AMD Athlon CPU, the
       code generated by GCC 3.1 is 6% faster on the average (8.2% faster
       with profile feedback) compared to GCC 3.0. The code produced by
       GCC 3.0 is about 2.1% faster compared to 2.95.3. Tests were done
       using the -O2 -march=athlon command-line options.
     * Alexandre Oliva, of Red Hat, has generalized the tree inlining
       infrastructure developed by CodeSourcery, LLC for the C++ front
       end, so that it is now used in the C front end too. Inlining
       functions as trees exposes them earlier to the compiler, giving it
       more opportunities for optimization.
     * Support for data prefetching instructions has been added to the
       GCC back end and several targets. A new __builtin_prefetch
       intrinsic is available to explicitly insert prefetch instructions
       and experimental support for loop array prefetching has been added
       (see -fprefetch-loop-array documentation).
     * Support for emitting debugging information for macros has been
       added for DWARF2. It is activated using -g3.

New Languages and Language specific improvements

  C/C++

     * A few more [4]ISO C99 features.
     * The preprocessor is 10-50% faster than the preprocessor in GCC
       3.0.
     * The preprocessor's symbol table has been merged with the symbol
       table of the C, C++ and Objective-C front ends.
     * The preprocessor consumes less memory than the preprocessor in GCC
       3.0, often significantly so. On normal input files, it typically
       consumes less memory than pre-3.0 cccp-based GCC, too.

  C++

     * -fhonor-std and -fno-honor-std have been removed. -fno-honor-std
       was a workaround to allow std compliant code to work with the
       non-std compliant libstdc++-v2. libstdc++-v3 is std compliant.
     * The C++ ABI has been fixed so that void (A::*)() const is mangled
       as "M1AKFvvE", rather than "MK1AFvvE" as before. This change only
       affects pointer to cv-qualified member function types.
     * The C++ ABI has been changed to correctly handle this code:
    struct A {
      void operator delete[] (void *, size_t);
    };

    struct B : public A {
    };

    new B[10];

       The amount of storage allocated for the array will be greater than
       it was in 3.0, in order to store the number of elements in the
       array, so that the correct size can be passed to operator delete[]
       when the array is deleted. Previously, the value passed to
       operator delete[] was unpredictable.
       This change will only affect code that declares a two-argument
       operator delete[] with a second parameter of type size_t in a base
       class, and does not override that definition in a derived class.
     * The C++ ABI has been changed so that:
    struct A {
      void operator delete[] (void *, size_t);
      void operator delete[] (void *);
    };

       does not cause unnecessary storage to be allocated when an array
       of A objects is allocated.
       This change will only affect code that declares both of these
       forms of operator delete[], and declared the two-argument form
       before the one-argument form.
     * The C++ ABI has been changed so that when a parameter is passed by
       value, any cleanup for that parameter is performed in the caller,
       as specified by the ia64 C++ ABI, rather than the called function
       as before. As a result, classes with a non-trivial destructor but
       a trivial copy constructor will be passed and returned by
       invisible reference, rather than by bitwise copy as before.
     * G++ now supports the "named return value optimization": for code
       like
    A f () {
      A a;
      ...
      return a;
    }

       G++ will allocate a in the return value slot, so that the return
       becomes a no-op. For this to work, all return statements in the
       function must return the same variable.
     * Improvements to the C++ library are listed in [5]the libstdc++-v3
       FAQ.

  Objective-C

     * Annoying linker warnings (due to incorrect code being generated)
       have been fixed.
     * If a class method cannot be found, the compiler no longer issues a
       warning if a corresponding instance method exists in the root
       class.
     * Forward @protocol declarations have been fixed.
     * Loading of categories has been fixed in certain situations (GNU
       run time only).
     * The class lookup in the run-time library has been rewritten so
       that class method dispatch is more than twice as fast as it used
       to be (GNU run time only).

  Java

     * libgcj now includes RMI, java.lang.ref.*, javax.naming, and
       javax.transaction.
     * Property files and other system resources can be compiled into
       executables which use libgcj using the new gcj --resource feature.
     * libgcj has been ported to more platforms. In particular there is
       now a mostly-functional mingw32 (Windows) target port.
     * JNI and CNI invocation interfaces were implemented, so
       gcj-compiled Java code can now be called from a C/C++ application.
     * gcj can now use builtin functions for certain known methods, for
       instance Math.cos.
     * gcj can now automatically remove redundant array-store checks in
       some common cases.
     * The --no-store-checks optimization option was added. This can be
       used to omit runtime store checks for code which is known not to
       throw ArrayStoreException
     * The following third party interface standards were added to
       libgcj: org.w3c.dom and org.xml.sax.
     * java.security has been merged with GNU Classpath. The new package
       is now JDK 1.2 compliant, and much more complete.
     * A bytecode verifier was added to the libgcj interpreter.
     * java.lang.Character was rewritten to comply with the Unicode 3.0
       standard, and improve performance.
     * Partial support for many more locales was added to libgcj.
     * Socket timeouts have been implemented.
     * libgcj has been merged into a single shared library. There are no
       longer separate shared libraries for the garbage collector and
       zlib.
     * Several performance improvements were made to gcj and libgcj:
          + Hash synchronization (thin locks)
          + A special allocation path for finalizer-free objects
          + Thread-local allocation
          + Parallel GC, and other GC tweaks

  Fortran

   Fortran improvements are listed in [6]the Fortran documentation.

  Ada

   [7]Ada Core Technologies, Inc, has contributed its GNAT Ada 95 front
   end and associated tools. The GNAT compiler fully implements the Ada
   language as defined by the ISO/IEC 8652 standard.

   Please note that the integration of the Ada front end is still work in
   progress.

New Targets and Target Specific Improvements

     * Hans-Peter Nilsson has contributed a port to [8]MMIX, the CPU
       architecture used in new editions of Donald E. Knuth's The Art of
       Computer Programming.
     * [9]Axis Communications has contributed its port to the CRIS CPU
       architecture, used in the ETRAX system-on-a-chip series. See
       [10]Axis' developer site for technical information.
     * Alexandre Oliva, of Red Hat, has contributed a port to the
       [11]SuperH SH5 64-bit RISC microprocessor architecture, extending
       the existing SH port.
     * UltraSPARC is fully supported in 64-bit mode. The option -m64
       enables it.
     * For compatibility with the Sun compiler #pragma redefine_extname
       has been implemented on Solaris.
     * The x86 back end has had some noticeable work done to it.
          + SuSE Labs developers Jan Hubicka, Bo Thorsen and Andreas
            Jaeger have contributed a port to the AMD x86-64
            architecture. For more information on x86-64 see
            [12]http://www.x86-64.org.
          + The compiler now supports MMX, 3DNow!, SSE, and SSE2
            instructions. Options -mmmx, -m3dnow, -msse, and -msse2 will
            enable the respective instruction sets. Intel C++ compatible
            MMX/3DNow!/SSE intrinsics are implemented. SSE2 intrinsics
            will be added in next major release.
          + Following those improvements, targets for Pentium MMX, K6-2,
            K6-3, Pentium III, Pentium 4, and Athlon 4 Mobile/XP/MP were
            added. Refer to the documentation on -march= and -mcpu=
            options for details.
          + For those targets that support it, -mfpmath=sse will cause
            the compiler to generate SSE/SSE2 instructions for floating
            point math instead of x87 instructions. Usually, this will
            lead to quicker code -- especially on the Pentium 4. Note
            that only scalar floating point instructions are used and GCC
            does not exploit SIMD features yet.
          + Prefetch support has been added to the Pentium III, Pentium
            4, K6-2, K6-3, and Athlon series.
          + Code generated for floating point to integer conversions has
            been improved leading to better performance of many 3D
            applications.
     * The PowerPC back end has added 64-bit PowerPC GNU/Linux support.
     * C++ support for AIX has been improved.
     * Aldy Hernandez, of Red Hat, Inc, has contributed extensions to the
       PowerPC port supporting the AltiVec programming model (SIMD). The
       support, though presently useful, is experimental and is expected
       to stabilize for 3.2. The support is written to conform to
       Motorola's AltiVec specs. See -maltivec.

Obsolete Systems

   Support for a number of older systems has been declared obsolete in
   GCC 3.1. Unless there is activity to revive them, the next release of
   GCC will have their sources permanently removed.

   All configurations of the following processor architectures have been
   declared obsolete:
     * MIL-STD-1750A, 1750a-*-*
     * AMD A29k, a29k-*-*

     * Western Electric 32000, we32k-*-*

   Most configurations of the following processor architectures have been
   declared obsolete, but we are preserving a few systems which may have
   active developers. It is unlikely that the remaining systems will
   survive much longer unless we see definite signs of port activity.
     * Motorola 88000 except
          + Generic a.out, m88k-*-aout*
          + Generic SVR4, m88k-*-sysv4

          + OSF/1, alpha*-*-osf[123]*. (Digital Unix and Tru64 Unix, aka
            alpha*-*-osf[45], are still supported.)
     * ARM:
          + RISCiX, arm-*-riscix*.
     * i386:

     * SPARC:
          + RTEMS/a.out, sparc-*-rtemsaout*.

Documentation improvements

     * The old manual ("Using and Porting the GNU Compiler Collection")
       has been replaced by a users manual ("Using the GNU Compiler
       Collection") and a separate internals reference manual ("GNU
       Compiler Collection Internals").
     * More complete and much improved documentation about GCC's internal
       representation used by the C and C++ front ends.
     * Many cleanups and improvements in general.

                                 GCC 3.0.4

   February 20, 2002

   The [1]GNU project and the GCC developers are pleased to announce the
   release of GCC 3.0.4, which is a bug-fix release for the GCC 3.0
   series.

   GCC used to stand for the GNU C Compiler, but since the compiler
   supports several other languages aside from C, it now stands for the
   GNU Compiler Collection.

   GCC 3.0.x has several new optimizations, new targets, new languages
   and many other new features, relative to GCC 2.95.x. See the [2]new
   features page for a more complete list.

   A list of [3]successful builds is updated as new information becomes
   available.

   The GCC developers would like to thank the numerous people that have
   contributed new features, test results, bugfixes, etc to GCC. This
   [4]amazing group of volunteers is what makes GCC successful.

   And finally, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some
   [5]caveats to using GCC 3.0.x.

   For additional information about GCC please refer to the [6]GCC
   project web site or contact the [7]GCC development mailing list.

   To obtain GCC please use [8]our mirror sites, one of the [9]GNU mirror
   sites, or [10]our CVS server.
     _________________________________________________________________

http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.0/features.html

                            GCC 3.0 New Features

Additional changes in GCC 3.0.4

     * GCC 3.0 now supports newer versions of the [1]NetBSD operating
       system, which use the ELF object file format, on x86 processors.
     * Correct debugging information is generated from functions that
       have lines from multiple files (e.g. yacc output).
     * A fix for whitespace handling in the -traditional preprocessor,
       which can affect Fortran.
     * Fixes to the exception handling runtime.
     * More fixes for bad code generation in C++.
     * A fix for shared library generation under AIX 4.3.
     * Documentation updates.
     * Port of GCC to Tensilica's Xtensa processor contributed.
     * A fix for compiling the PPC Linux kernel (FAT fs wouldn't link).

Additional changes in GCC 3.0.3

     * A fix to correct an accidental change to the PowerPC ABI.
     * Fixes for bad code generation on a variety of architectures.
     * Improvements to the debugging information generated for C++
       classes.
     * Fixes for bad code generation in C++.
     * A fix to avoid crashes in the C++ demangler.
     * A fix to the C++ standard library to avoid buffer overflows.
     * Miscellaneous improvements for a variety of architectures.

Additional changes in GCC 3.0.2

     * Fixes for bad code generation during loop unrolling.
     * Fixes for bad code generation by the sibling call optimization.
     * Minor improvements to x86 code generation.
     * Implementation of function descriptors in C++ vtables for IA64.
     * Numerous minor bug-fixes.

Additional changes in GCC 3.0.1

     * C++ fixes for incorrect code-generation.
     * Improved cross-compiling support for the C++ standard library.
     * Fixes for some embedded targets that worked in GCC 2.95.3, but not
       in GCC 3.0.
     * Fixes for various exception-handling bugs.
     * A port to the S/390 architecture.

General Optimizer Improvements

     * [2]Basic block reordering pass.
     * New if-conversion pass with support for conditional (predicated)
       execution.
     * New tail call and sibling call elimination optimizations.
     * New register renaming pass.
     * New (experimental) [3]static single assignment (SSA)
       representation support.
     * New dead-code elimination pass implemented using the SSA
       representation.
     * [4]Global null pointer test elimination.
     * [5]Global code hoisting/unification.
     * More builtins and optimizations for stdio.h, string.h and old BSD
       functions, as well as for ISO C99 functions.
     * New builtin __builtin_expect for giving hints to the branch
       predictor.

New Languages and Language specific improvements

     * The GNU Compiler for the Java(TM) language (GCJ) is now integrated
       and supported, including the run-time library containing most
       common non-GUI Java classes, a bytecode interpreter, and the Boehm
       conservative garbage collector. Many bugs have been fixed. GCJ can
       compile Java source or Java bytecodes to either native code or
       Java class files, and supports native methods written in either
       the standard JNI or the more efficient and convenient CNI.
     * Here is a [6]partial list of C++ improvements, both new features
       and those no longer supported.
     * New C++ ABI. On the IA-64 platform GCC is capable of
       inter-operating with other IA-64 compilers.
     * The new ABI also significantly reduces the size of symbol and
       debug information.
     * New [7]C++ support library and many C++ bug fixes, vastly
       improving our conformance to the ISO C++ standard.
     * New [8]inliner for C++.
     * Rewritten C preprocessor, integrated into the C, C++ and Objective
       C compilers, with very many improvements including ISO C99 support
       and [9]improvements to dependency generation.
     * Support for more [10]ISO C99 features.
     * Many improvements to support for checking calls to format
       functions such as printf and scanf, including support for ISO C99
       format features, extensions from the Single Unix Specification and
       GNU libc 2.2, checking of strfmon formats and features to assist
       in auditing for format string security bugs.
     * New warnings for C code that may have undefined semantics because
       of violations of sequence point rules in the C standard (such as a
       = a++;, a[n] = b[n++]; and a[i++] = i;), included in -Wall.
     * Additional warning option -Wfloat-equal.
     * Improvements to -Wtraditional.
     * Fortran improvements are listed in [11]the Fortran documentation.

New Targets and Target Specific Improvements

     * New x86 back-end, generating much improved code.
     * Support for a generic i386-elf target contributed.
     * New option to emit x86 assembly code using Intel style syntax
       (-mintel-syntax).
     * HPUX 11 support contributed.
     * Improved PowerPC code generation, including scheduled prologue and
       epilogue.
     * Port of GCC to Intel's IA-64 processor contributed.
     * Port of GCC to Motorola's MCore 210 and 340 contributed.
     * New unified back-end for Arm, Thumb and StrongArm contributed.
     * Port of GCC to Intel's XScale processor contributed.
     * Port of GCC to Atmel's AVR microcontrollers contributed.
     * Port of GCC to Mitsubishi's D30V processor contributed.
     * Port of GCC to Matsushita's AM33 processor (a member of the
       MN10300 processor family) contributed.
     * Port of GCC to Fujitsu's FR30 processor contributed.
     * Port of GCC to Motorola's 68HC11 and 68HC12 processors
       contributed.
     * Port of GCC to Sun's picoJava processor core contributed.

Documentation improvements

     * Substantially rewritten and improved C preprocessor manual.
     * Many improvements to other documentation.
     * Manpages for gcc, cpp and gcov are now generated automatically
       from the master Texinfo manual, eliminating the problem of
       manpages being out of date. (The generated manpages are only
       extracts from the full manual, which is provided in Texinfo form,
       from which info, HTML, other formats and a printed manual can be
       generated.)
     * Generated info files are included in the release tarballs
       alongside their Texinfo sources, avoiding problems on some
       platforms with building makeinfo as part of the GCC distribution.

Other significant improvements

     * Garbage collection used internally by the compiler for most memory
       allocation instead of obstacks.
     * Lengauer and Tarjan algorithm used for computing dominators in the
       CFG. This algorithm can be significantly faster and more space
       efficient than our older algorithm.
     * gccbug script provided to assist in submitting bug reports to our
       bug tracking system. (Bug reports previously submitted directly to
       our mailing lists, for which you received no bug tracking number,
       should be submitted again using gccbug if you can reproduce the
       problem with GCC 3.0.)
     * The internal libgcc library is [12]built as a shared library on
       systems that support it.
     * Extensive testsuite included with GCC, with many new tests. In
       addition to tests for GCC bugs that have been fixed, many tests
       have been added for language features, compiler warnings and
       builtin functions.
     * Additional language-independent warning options -Wpacked,
       -Wpadded, -Wunreachable-code and -Wdisabled-optimization.
     * Target-independent options -falign-functions, -falign-loops and
       -falign-jumps.

   Plus a great many bugfixes and almost all the [13]features found in
   GCC 2.95.

http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.0/caveats.html

                              GCC 3.0 Caveats

     * -fstrict-aliasing is now part of -O2 and higher optimization
       levels. This allows the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing
       rules applicable to the language being compiled. For C and C++,
       this activates optimizations based on the type of expressions.
       This optimization may thus break old, non-compliant code.
     * Enumerations are now properly promoted to int in function
       parameters and function returns. Normally this change is not
       visible, but when using -fshort-enums this is an ABI change.
     * The undocumented extension that allowed C programs to have a label
       at the end of a compound statement has been deprecated and may be
       removed in a future version. Programs that now generate a warning
       about this may be fixed by adding a null statement (a single
       semicolon) after the label.
     * The poorly documented extension that allowed string constants in
       C, C++ and Objective C to contain unescaped newlines has been
       deprecated and may be removed in a future version. Programs using
       this extension may be fixed in several ways: the bare newline may
       be replaced by \n, or preceded by \n\, or string concatenation may
       be used with the bare newline preceded by \n" and " placed at the
       start of the next line.
     * The Chill compiler is not included in GCC 3.0, because of the lack
       of a volunteer to convert it to use garbage collection.
     * Certain non-standard iostream methods from earlier versions of
       libstdc++ are not included in libstdc++ v3, i.e. filebuf::attach,
       ostream::form, and istream::gets. Here are workaround hints for:
       [1]ostream::form, [2]filebuf::attach.
     * The new C++ ABI is not yet fully supported by current (as of
       2001-07-01) releases and development versions of GDB, or any
       earlier versions. There is a problem setting breakpoints by line
       number, and other related issues that have been fixed in GCC 3.0
       but not yet handled in GDB:

                                  GCC 2.95

   July 31, 1999: The GNU project and the GCC/EGCS developers are pleased
   to announce the release of GCC version 2.95. This is the first release
   of GCC since the April 1999 GCC/EGCS reunification and includes nearly
   a year's worth of new development and bugfixes.

   August 19, 1999: GCC version 2.95.1 has been released.

   October 27, 1999: GCC version 2.95.2 has been released.

   March 16, 2001: GCC version 2.95.3 has been released.

   GCC used to stand for the GNU C Compiler, but since the compiler
   supports several other languages aside from C, it now stands for the
   GNU Compiler Collection.

   The whole suite has been extensively [1]regression tested and
   [2]package tested. It should be reliable and suitable for widespread
   use.

   The compiler has several new optimizations, new targets, new languages
   and other new features. See the [3]new features page for a more
   complete list of new features found in the GCC 2.95 releases.

   The sources include installation instructions in both HTML and
   plaintext forms in the install directory in the distribution. However,
   the most up to date [4]installation instructions and [5]build/test
   status are on the web pages. We will update those pages as new
   information becomes available.

   The GCC developers would like to thank the numerous people that have
   contributed new features, test results, bugfixes, etc to GCC. This
   [6]amazing group of volunteers is what makes GCC successful.

   And finally, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some
   [7]caveats to using GCC 2.95.

   Download GCC 2.95 from the [8]GNU FTP server (ftp://ftp.gnu.org)

Additional Changes in GCC 2.95.1

     * Generic bugfixes and improvements
          + Various documentation fixes related to the GCC/EGCS merger.
          + Fix memory management bug which could lead to spurious
            aborts, core dumps or random parsing errors in the compiler.

            AIX platforms.
          + Fix -fpic code generation bug for rs6000/ppc svr4 targets.
          + Fix varargs/stdarg code generation bug for rs6000/ppc svr4

            removed in the next major release of G++. Use of signatures
            will result in a warning from the compiler.
          + Several bugs relating to templates and namespaces were fixed.
          + A bug that caused crashes when combining templates with -g on
            DWARF1 platforms was fixed.
          + Pointers-to-members, virtual functions, and multiple
            inheritance should now work together correctly.
          + Some code-generation bugs relating to function try blocks
            were fixed.
          + G++ is a little bit more lenient with certain archaic
            constructs than in GCC 2.95.
          + Fix to prevent shared library version #s from bring truncated
            to 1 digit
          + Fix missing std:: in the libstdc++ library.
          + Fix stream locking problems in libio.
          + Fix problem in java compiler driver.

Additional Changes in GCC 2.95.2

   The -fstrict-aliasing is not enabled by default for GCC 2.95.2. While
   the optimizations performed by -fstrict-aliasing are valid according
   to the C and C++ standards, the optimization have caused some
   problems, particularly with old non-conforming code.

   The GCC developers are experimenting with ways to warn users about
   code which violates the C/C++ standards, but those warnings are not
   ready for widespread use at this time. Rather than wait for those
   warnings the GCC developers have chosen to disable -fstrict-aliasing
   by default for the GCC 2.95.2 release.

   We strongly encourage developers to find and fix code which violates
   the C/C++ standards as -fstrict-aliasing may be enabled by default in
   future releases. Use the option -fstrict-aliasing to re-enable these
   optimizations.
     * Generic bugfixes and improvements
          + Fix incorrectly optimized memory reference in global common
            subexpression elimination (GCSE) optimization pass.
          + Fix code generation bug in regmove.c in which it could
            incorrectly change a "const" value.
          + Fix bug in optimization of conditionals involving volatile
            memory references.
          + Avoid over-allocation of stack space for some procedures.
          + Fixed bug in the compiler which caused incorrect optimization
            of an obscure series of bit manipulations, shifts and
            arithmetic.
          + Fixed register allocator bug which caused teTeX to be
            mis-compiled on SPARC targets.
          + Avoid incorrect optimization of degenerate case statements
            for certain targets such as the ARM.
          + Fix out of range memory reference in the jump optimizer.
          + Avoid dereferencing null pointer in fix-header.
          + Fix test for GCC specific features so that it is possible to
            bootstrap with gcc-2.6.2 and older versions of GCC.
          + Fix typo in scheduler which could potentially cause out of
            range memory accesses.
          + Avoid incorrect loop reversal which caused incorrect code for
            certain loops on PowerPC targets.
          + Avoid incorrect optimization of switch statements on certain
            targets (for example the ARM).
     * Platform specific bugfixes and improvements
          + Work around bug in Sun V5.0 compilers which caused bootstrap
            comparison failures on SPARC targets.
          + Fix SPARC backend bug which caused aborts in final.c.
          + Fix sparc-hal-solaris2* configuration fragments.
          + Fix bug in sparc block profiling.
          + Fix obscure code generation bug for the PARISC targets.
          + Define __STDC_EXT__ for HPUX configurations.
          + Various POWERPC64 code generation bugfixes.
          + Fix abort for PPC targets using ELF (ex GNU/Linux).
          + Fix collect2 problems for AIX targets.
          + Correct handling of .file directive for PPC targets.
          + Fix bug in fix_trunc x86 patterns.
          + Fix x86 port to correctly pop the FP stack for functions that
            return structures in memory.
          + Fix minor bug in strlen x86 pattern.
          + Use stabs debugging instead of dwarf1 for x86-solaris
            targets.
          + Fix template repository code to handle leading underscore in
            mangled names.
          + Fix weak/weak alias support for OpenBSD.
          + GNU/Linux for the ARM has C++ compatible include files.
     * Language & Runtime specific fixes.
          + Fix handling of constructor attribute in the C front-end
            which caused problems building the Chill runtime library on
            some targets.
          + Fix minor problem merging type qualifiers in the C front-end.
          + Fix aliasing bug for pointers and references (C/C++).
          + Fix incorrect "non-constant initializer bug" when
            -traditional or -fwritable-strings is enabled.
          + Fix build error for Chill front-end on SunOS.

http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-2.95/caveats.html

                              GCC 2.95 Caveats

     * GCC 2.95 will issue an error for invalid asm statements that had
       been silently accepted by earlier versions of the compiler. This
       is particularly noticeable when compiling older versions of the
       Linux kernel (2.0.xx). Please refer to the FAQ (as shipped with
       GCC 2.95) for more information on this issue.
     * GCC 2.95 implements type based alias analysis to disambiguate
       memory references. Some programs, particularly the Linux kernel
       violate ANSI/ISO aliasing rules and therefore may not operate
       correctly when compiled with GCC 2.95. Please refer to the FAQ (as
       shipped with GCC 2.95) for more information on this issue.
     * GCC 2.95 has a known bug in its handling of complex variables for
       64bit targets. Instead of silently generating incorrect code, GCC
       2.95 will issue a fatal error for situations it can not handle.
       This primarily affects the Fortran community as Fortran makes more
       use of complex variables than C or C++.
     * GCC 2.95 has an integrated libstdc++, but does not have an
       integrated libg++. Furthermore old libg++ releases will not work
       with GCC 2.95. You can retrieve a recent copy of libg++ from the
       [1]GCC ftp server.
       Note most C++ programs only need libstdc++.
     * Exception handling may not work with shared libraries,
       particularly on alphas, hppas, rs6000/powerpc and mips based
       platforms. Exception handling is known to work on x86 GNU/Linux
       platforms with shared libraries.
     * In general, GCC 2.95 is more rigorous about rejecting invalid C++
       code or deprecated C++ constructs than G++ 2.7, G++ 2.8, EGCS 1.0,
       or EGCS 1.1. As a result it may be necessary to fix C++ code
       before it will compile with GCC 2.95.
     * G++ is also converting toward the ISO C++ standard; as a result
       code which was previously valid (and thus accepted by other
       compilers and older versions of g++) may no longer be accepted.
       The flag -fpermissive may allow some non-conforming code to
       compile with GCC 2.95.
     * GCC 2.95 compiled C++ code is not binary compatible with EGCS
       1.1.x, EGCS 1.0.x or GCC 2.8.x.
     * GCC 2.95 does not have changes from the GCC 2.8 tree that were
       made between Sept 30, 1998 and April 30, 1999 (the official end of
       the GCC 2.8 project). Future GCC releases will include all the
       changes from the defunct GCC 2.8 sources.

                                  EGCS 1.1

   September 3, 1998: We are pleased to announce the release of EGCS 1.1.
   December 1, 1998: We are pleased to announce the release of EGCS
   1.1.1.
   March 15, 1999: We are pleased to announce the release of EGCS 1.1.2.

   EGCS is a free software project to further the development of the GNU
   compilers using an open development environment.

   EGCS 1.1 is a major new release of the EGCS compiler system. It has
   been [1]extensively tested and is believed to be stable and suitable
   for widespread use.

   EGCS 1.1 is based on an June 6, 1998 snapshot of the GCC 2.8
   development sources; it contains all of the new features found in GCC
   2.8.1 as well as all new development from GCC up to June 6, 1998.

   EGCS 1.1 also contains many improvements and features not found in GCC
   or in older versions of EGCS:
     * Global common subexpression elimination and global constant/copy
       propagation (aka [2]gcse)
     * Ongoing improvements to the [3]alias analysis support to allow for
       better optimizations throughout the compiler.
     * Vastly improved [4]C++ compiler and integrated C++ runtime
       libraries.
     * Fixes for the /tmp symlink race security problems.
     * New targets including mips16, arm-thumb and 64 bit PowerPC.
     * Improvements to GNU Fortran (g77) compiler and runtime library

   Each release includes installation instructions in both HTML and
   plaintext forms (see the INSTALL directory in the toplevel directory
   of the distribution). However, we also keep the most up to date
   [6]installation instructions and [7]build/test status on our web page.
   We will update those pages as new information becomes available.

   The EGCS project would like to thank the numerous people that have
   contributed new features, test results, bugfixes, etc. This [8]amazing
   group of volunteers is what makes EGCS successful.

   And finally, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some
   [9]caveats to using EGCS 1.1.

   Download EGCS from egcs.cygnus.com (USA California).

   The EGCS 1.1 release is also available on many mirror sites.

http://gcc.gnu.org/egcs-1.1/features.html

                           EGCS 1.1 new features

     * Integrated GNU Fortran (g77) compiler and runtime library with
       improvements, based on [1]g77 version 0.5.23.
     * Vast improvements in the C++ compiler; so many they have [2]page
       of their own!
     * Compiler implements [3]global common subexpression elimination and
       global copy/constant propagation.
     * More major improvements in the [4]alias analysis code.
     * More major improvements in the exception handling code to improve
       performance, lower static overhead and provide the infrastructure
       for future improvements.
     * The infamous /tmp symlink race security problems have been fixed.
     * The regmove optimization pass has been nearly completely rewritten
       to improve performance of generated code.
     * The compiler now recomputes register usage information before
       local register allocation. By providing more accurate information
       to the priority based allocator, we get better register
       allocation.
     * The register reloading phase of the compiler optimizes spill code
       much better than in previous releases.
     * Some bad interactions between the register allocator and
       instruction scheduler have been fixed, resulting in much better
       code for certain programs. Additionally, we have tuned the
       scheduler in various ways to improve performance of generated code
       for some architectures.
     * The compiler's branch shortening algorithms have been
       significantly improved to work better on targets which align jump
       targets.
     * The compiler now supports -Os to prefer optimizing for code space
       over optimizing for code speed.
     * The compiler will now totally eliminate library calls which
       compute constant values. This primarily helps targets with no
       integer div/mul support and targets without floating point
       support.
     * The compiler now supports an extensive "--help" option.
     * cpplib has been greatly improved and may be suitable for limited
       use.
     * Memory footprint for the compiler has been significantly reduced
       for some pathological cases.
     * The time to build EGCS has been improved for certain targets
       (particularly the alpha and mips platforms).
     * Many infrastructure improvements throughout the compiler, plus the
       usual mountain of bugfixes and minor improvements.
     * Target dependent improvements:
          + SPARC port now includes V8 plus and V9 support as well as
            performance tuning for Ultra class machines. The SPARC port
            now uses the Haifa scheduler.
          + Alpha port has been tuned for the EV6 processor and has an
            optimized expansion of memcpy/bzero. The Alpha port now uses
            the Haifa scheduler.
          + RS6000/PowerPC: support for the Power64 architecture and AIX
            4.3. The RS6000/PowerPC port now uses the Haifa scheduler.
          + x86: Alignment of static store data and jump targets is per
            Intel recommendations now. Various improvements throughout
            the x86 port to improve performance on Pentium processors
            (including improved epilogue sequences for Pentium chips and
            backend improvements which should help register allocation on
            all x86 variants. Conditional move support has been fixed and
            enabled for PPro processors. The x86 port also better
            supports 64bit operations now. Unixware 7, a System V Release
            5 target, is now supported and SCO OpenServer targets can
            support GAS.
          + MIPS has improved multiply/multiply-add support and now
            includes mips16 ISA support.
          + M68k has many micro-optimizations and Coldfire fixes.
     * Core compiler is based on the GCC development tree from June 9,
       1998, so we have all of the [5]features found in GCC 2.8.

http://gcc.gnu.org/egcs-1.1/caveats.html

                              EGCS 1.1 Caveats

     * EGCS has an integrated libstdc++, but does not have an integrated
       libg++. Furthermore old libg++ releases will not work with EGCS;
       HJ Lu has made a libg++-2.8.1.2 snapshot available which may work
       with EGCS.
       Note most C++ programs only need libstdc++.
     * Exception handling may not work with shared libraries,
       particularly on alphas, hppas, rs6000/powerpc and mips based
       platforms. Exception handling is known to work on x86-linux
       platforms with shared libraries.
     * Some versions of the Linux kernel have bugs which prevent them
       from being compiled or from running when compiled by EGCS. See the
       FAQ (as shipped with EGCS 1.1) for additional information.
     * In general, EGCS is more rigorous about rejecting invalid C++ code
       or deprecated C++ constructs than g++-2.7, g++-2.8 or EGCS 1.0. As
       a result it may be necessary to fix C++ code before it will
       compile with EGCS.
     * G++ is also converting toward the ISO C++ standard; as a result
       code which was previously valid (and thus accepted by other
       compilers and older versions of g++) may no longer be accepted.
     * EGCS 1.1 compiled C++ code is not binary compatible with EGCS
       1.0.x or GCC 2.8.x due to changes necessary to support thread safe
       exception handling.

                                 EGCS 1.0.3

   May 15, 1998

   We are pleased to announce the release of EGCS 1.0.3.

   EGCS is a collaborative effort involving several groups of hackers
   using an open development model to accelerate development and testing
   of GNU compilers and runtime libraries.

   EGCS 1.0.3 is a minor update to the EGCS 1.0.2 compiler to fix a few
   problems reported by Red Hat for builds of Red Hat 5.1.
     * Generic bugfixes:
          + Fix a typo in the libio library which resulted in incorrect
            behavior of istream::get.
          + Fix the Fortran negative array index problem.
          + Fix a major problem with the ObjC runtime thread support
            exposed by glibc2.
          + Reduce memory consumption of the Haifa scheduler.
     * Target specific bugfixes:
          + Fix one x86 floating point code generation bug exposed by
            glibc2 builds.
          + Fix one x86 internal compiler error exposed by glibc2 builds.
          + Fix profiling bugs on the Alpha.
          + Fix ImageMagick & emacs 20.2 build problems on the Alpha.
          + Fix rs6000/ppc bug when converting values from integer types
            to floating point types.

   An important goal of EGCS is to allow wide scale testing of new
   features and optimizations which are still under development. However,
   EGCS has been carefully tested and should be comparable in quality to
   most GCC releases.

   EGCS 1.0.3 is based on an August 2, 1997 snapshot of the GCC 2.8
   development sources; it contains nearly all of the new features found
   in GCC 2.8.

   EGCS also contains many improvements and features not found in GCC 2.7
   or GCC 2.8.
     * Integrated C++ runtime libraries, including support for most major
       GNU/Linux systems!
     * The integrated libstdc++ library includes a verbatim copy of SGI's
       STL release instead of a modified copy.
     * Integrated GNU Fortran compiler.
     * New instruction scheduler.
     * New alias analysis code.

   See the [1]new features page for a more complete list of new features
   found in EGCS 1.0.x releases.

   The EGCS 1.0.3 release includes installation instructions in both HTML
   and plaintext forms (see the INSTALL directory in the toplevel
   directory of the EGCS 1.0.3 distribution). However, we also keep the
   most up to date [2]installation instructions and [3]build/test status
   on our web page. We will update those pages as new information becomes
   available.

   And, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some [4]caveats to
   using EGCS.

   Update: Big thanks to Stanford for providing a high speed link for
   downloading EGCS (go.cygnus.com)!

   Download EGCS from ftp.cygnus.com (USA California) or go.cygnus.com
   (USA California -- High speed link provided by Stanford).

   The EGCS 1.0.3 release is also available on many mirror sites.

   We'd like to thank the numerous people that have contributed new
   features, test results, bugfixes, etc. Unfortunately, they're far too
   numerous to mention by name.

                                 EGCS 1.0.1

   January 6, 1998

   We are pleased to announce the release of EGCS 1.0.1.

   EGCS is a collaborative effort involving several groups of hackers
   using an open development model to accelerate development and testing
   of GNU compilers and runtime libraries.

   EGCS 1.0.1 is a minor update to the EGCS 1.0 compiler to fix a few
   critical bugs and add support for Red Hat 5.0 Linux. Changes since the
   EGCS 1.0 release:
     * Add support for Red Hat 5.0 Linux and better support for Linux
       systems using glibc2.
       Many programs failed to link when compiled with EGCS 1.0 on Red
       Hat 5.0 or on systems with newer versions of glibc2. EGCS 1.0.1
       should fix these problems.
     * Compatibility with both EGCS 1.0 and GCC 2.8 libgcc exception
       handling interfaces.
       To avoid future compatibility problems, we strongly urge anyone
       who is planning on distributing shared libraries that contain C++
       code to upgrade to EGCS 1.0.1 first.
       Soon after EGCS 1.0 was released, the GCC developers made some
       incompatible changes in libgcc's exception handling interfaces.
       These changes were needed to solve problems on some platforms.
       This means that GCC 2.8.0, when released, will not be seamlessly
       compatible with shared libraries built by EGCS 1.0. The reason is
       that the libgcc.a in GCC 2.8.0 will not contain a function needed
       by the old interface.
       The result of this is that there may be compatibility problems
       with shared libraries built by EGCS 1.0 when used with GCC 2.8.0.
       With EGCS 1.0.1, generated code uses the new (GCC 2.8.0)
       interface, and libgcc.a has the support routines for both the old
       and the new interfaces (so EGCS 1.0.1 and EGCS 1.0 code can be
       freely mixed, and EGCS 1.0.1 and GCC 2.8.0 code can be freely
       mixed).
       The maintainers of GCC 2.x have decided against including seamless
       support for the old interface in 2.8.0, since it was never
       "official", so to avoid future compatibility problems we recommend
       against distributing any shared libraries built by EGCS 1.0 that
       contain C++ code (upgrade to 1.0.1 and use that).
     * Various bugfixes in the x86, hppa, mips, and rs6000/ppc backends.
       The x86 changes fix code generation errors exposed when building
       glibc2 and the Linux dynamic linker (ld.so).
       The hppa change fixes a compiler abort when configured for use
       with RTEMS.
       The MIPS changes fix problems with the definition of LONG_MAX on
       newer systems, allow for command line selection of the target ABI,
       and fix one code generation problem.
       The rs6000/ppc change fixes some problems with passing structures
       to varargs/stdarg functions.
     * A few machine independent bugfixes, mostly to fix code generation
       errors when building Linux kernels or glibc.
     * Fix a few critical exception handling and template bugs in the C++
       compiler.
     * Fix Fortran namelist bug on alphas.
     * Fix build problems on x86-solaris systems.

   An important goal of EGCS is to allow wide scale testing of new
   features and optimizations which are still under development. However,
   EGCS has been carefully tested and should be comparable in quality to
   most GCC releases.

   EGCS 1.0.1 is based on an August 2, 1997 snapshot of the GCC 2.8
   development sources; it contains nearly all of the new features found
   in GCC 2.8.

   EGCS also contains many improvements and features not found in GCC 2.7
   and even the soon to be released GCC 2.8 compilers.
     * Integrated C++ runtime libraries, including support for most major
       linux systems!
     * The integrated libstdc++ library includes a verbatim copy of SGI's
       STL release.
     * Integrated GNU Fortran compiler
     * New instruction scheduler
     * New alias analysis code

   See the [1]new features page for a more complete list of new features
   found in EGCS 1.0.x releases.

   The EGCS 1.0.1 release includes installation instructions in both HTML

                                  EGCS 1.0

   December 3, 1997

   We are pleased to announce the release of EGCS 1.0.

   EGCS is a collaborative effort involving several groups of hackers
   using an open development model to accelerate development and testing
   of GNU compilers and runtime libraries.

   An important goal of EGCS is to allow wide scale testing of
   experimental features and optimizations; therefore, EGCS contains some
   features and optimizations which are still under development. However,
   EGCS has been carefully tested and should be comparable in quality to
   most GCC releases.

   EGCS 1.0 is based on an August 2, 1997 snapshot of the GCC 2.8
   development sources; it contains nearly all of the new features found
   in GCC 2.8.

   EGCS 1.0 also contains many improvements and features not found in GCC
   2.7 and even the soon to be released GCC 2.8 compilers.
     * Integrated C++ runtime libraries, including support for most major
       linux systems!
     * The integrated libstdc++ library includes a verbatim copy of SGI's
       STL release.
     * Integrated GNU Fortran compiler.
     * New instruction scheduler.
     * New alias analysis code.

   See the [1]new features page for a more complete list of new features.

   The EGCS 1.0 release includes installation instructions in both HTML
   and plaintext forms (see the INSTALL directory in the toplevel
   directory of the EGCS 1.0 distribution). However, we also keep the
   most up to date [2]installation instructions and [3]build/test status
   on our web page. We will update those pages as new information becomes
   available.

   And, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some [4]caveats to
   using EGCS.

   Update: The T1 into our main California offices has been 100%
   saturated since shortly after the release. We've added an EGCS 1.0
   mirror at our Massachusetts office to help share the load. We also
   encourage folks to use the many mirrors available throughout the
   world.

   Update: Big thanks to Stanford for providing a high speed link for
   downloading EGCS (go.cygnus.com)!

   Download EGCS from ftp.cygnus.com (USA California) or go.cygnus.com
   (USA California -- High speed link provided by Stanford).

   The EGCS 1.0 release should be available on most mirror sites by now.

   We'd like to thank the numerous people that have contributed new
   features, test results, bugfixes, etc. Unfortunately, they're far too
   numerous to mention by name.

http://gcc.gnu.org/egcs-1.0/features.html

                             EGCS 1.0 features

     * Core compiler is based on the gcc2 development tree from Aug 2,
       1997, so we have most of the [1]features found in GCC 2.8.
     * Integrated GNU Fortran compiler based on g77-0.5.22-19970929.
     * Vast improvements in the C++ compiler; so many they have [2]page
       of their own!
     * Integrated C++ runtime libraries, including support for most major
       linux systems!
     * New instruction scheduler from IBM Haifa which includes support
       for function wide instruction scheduling as well as superscalar
       scheduling.
     * Significantly improved alias analysis code.
     * Improved register allocation for two address machines.
     * Significant code generation improvements for Fortran code on
       Alphas.
     * Various optimizations from the g77 project as well as improved
       loop optimizations.
     * Dwarf2 debug format support for some targets.
     * egcs libstdc++ includes the SGI STL implementation without
       changes.
     * As a result of these and other changes, egcs libstc++ is not
       binary compatible with previous releases of libstdc++.
     * Various new ports -- UltraSPARC, Irix6.2 & Irix6.3 support, The
       SCO Openserver 5 family (5.0.{0,2,4} and Internet FastStart 1.0
       and 1.1), Support for RTEMS on several embedded targets, Support
       for arm-linux, Mitsubishi M32R, Hitachi H8/S, Matsushita MN102 and
       MN103, NEC V850, Sparclet, Solaris & Linux on PowerPCs, etc.
     * Integrated testsuites for gcc, g++, g77, libstdc++ and libio.
     * RS6000/PowerPC ports generate code which can run on all
       RS6000/PowerPC variants by default.
     * -mcpu= and -march= switches for the x86 port to allow better
       control over how the x86 port generates code.
     * Includes the template repository patch (aka repo patch); note the
       new template code makes repo obsolete for ELF systems using gnu-ld
       such as Linux.
     * Plus the usual assortment of bugfixes and improvements.

http://gcc.gnu.org/egcs-1.0/caveats.html

                              EGCS 1.0 Caveats

     * EGCS has an integrated libstdc++, but does not have an integrated
       libg++. Furthermore old libg++ releases will not work with egc; HJ
       Lu has made a libg++-2.8.1.2 available which may work with EGCS.
       Note most C++ programs only need libstdc++.
     * Note that using -pedantic or -Wreturn-type can cause an explosion
       in the amount of memory needed for template-heavy C++ code, such
       as code that uses STL. Also note that -Wall includes
       -Wreturn-type, so if you use -Wall you will need to specify
       -Wno-return-type to turn it off.
     * Exception handling may not work with shared libraries,
       particularly on alphas, hppas, and mips based platforms. Exception
       handling is known to work on x86-linux platforms with shared
       libraries.
     * Some versions of the Linux kernel have bugs which prevent them
       from being compiled or from running when compiled by EGCS. See the
       FAQ (as shipped with EGCS 1.0) for additional information.
     * In general, EGCS is more rigorous about rejecting invalid C++ code
       or deprecated C++ constructs than G++ 2.7. As a result it may be
       necessary to fix C++ code before it will compile with EGCS.
     * G++ is also aggressively tracking the C++ standard; as a result
       code which was previously valid (and thus accepted by other
       compilers and older versions of G++) may no longer be accepted.
     * EGCS 1.0 may not work with Red Hat Linux 5.0 on all targets. EGCS
       1.0.x and later releases should work with Red Hat Linux 5.0.
