Installing GCC
**************

   The latest version of this document is always available at
http://gcc.gnu.org/install/.

   This document describes the generic installation procedure for GCC
as well as detailing some target specific installation instructions.

   GCC includes several components that previously were separate
distributions with their own installation instructions.  This document
supersedes all package specific installation instructions.

   _Before_ starting the build/install procedure please check the *Note
host/target specific installation notes: Specific.  We recommend you
browse the entire generic installation instructions before you proceed.

   Lists of successful builds for released versions of GCC are
available at `http://gcc.gnu.org/buildstat.html'.  These lists are
updated as new information becomes available.

   The installation procedure itself is broken into five steps.

* Menu:

* Downloading the source::
* Configuration::
* Building::
* Testing:: (optional)
* Final install::

   Please note that GCC does not support `make uninstall' and probably
won't do so in the near future as this would open a can of worms.
Instead, we suggest that you install GCC into a directory of its own
and simply remove that directory when you do not need that specific
version of GCC any longer, and, if shared libraries are installed there
as well, no more binaries exist that use them.

Downloading GCC
***************

   GCC is distributed via CVS and FTP tarballs compressed with `gzip' or
`bzip2'.  It is possible to download a full distribution or specific
components.

   Please refer to our releases web page for information on how to
obtain GCC.

   The full distribution includes the C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran,
Java, and Ada (in case of GCC 3.1 and later) compilers.  The full
distribution also includes runtime libraries for C++, Objective-C,
Fortran, and Java.  In GCC 3.0 and later versions, GNU compiler
testsuites are also included in the full distribution.

   If you choose to download specific components, you must download the
core GCC distribution plus any language specific distributions you wish
to use.  The core distribution includes the C language front end as
well as the shared components.  Each language has a tarball which
includes the language front end as well as the language runtime (when
appropriate).

   Unpack the core distribution as well as any language specific
distributions in the same directory.

   If you also intend to build binutils (either to upgrade an existing
installation or for use in place of the corresponding tools of your
OS), unpack the binutils distribution either in the same directory or a
separate one.  In the latter case, add symbolic links to any components
of the binutils you intend to build alongside the compiler (`bfd',
`binutils', `gas', `gprof', `ld', `opcodes', ...) to the directory
containing the GCC sources.


File: gccinstall.info,  Node: Configuration,  Next: Building,  Prev: Downloading the source,  Up: Installing GCC

Installing GCC: Configuration
*****************************

   Like most GNU software, GCC must be configured before it can be
built.  This document describes the recommended configuration procedure
for both native and cross targets.

   We use SRCDIR to refer to the toplevel source directory for GCC; we
use OBJDIR to refer to the toplevel build/object directory.

   If you obtained the sources via CVS, SRCDIR must refer to the top
`gcc' directory, the one where the `MAINTAINERS' can be found, and not
its `gcc' subdirectory, otherwise the build will fail.

   If either SRCDIR or OBJDIR is located on an automounted NFS file
system, the shell's built-in `pwd' command will return temporary
pathnames.  Using these can lead to various sorts of build problems.
To avoid this issue, set the `PWDCMD' environment variable to an
automounter-aware `pwd' command, e.g., `pawd' or `amq -w', during the
configuration and build phases.

   First, we *highly* recommend that GCC be built into a separate
directory than the sources which does *not* reside within the source
tree.  This is how we generally build GCC; building where SRCDIR ==
OBJDIR should still work, but doesn't get extensive testing; building
where OBJDIR is a subdirectory of SRCDIR is unsupported.

   If you have previously built GCC in the same directory for a
different target machine, do `make distclean' to delete all files that
might be invalid.  One of the files this deletes is `Makefile'; if
`make distclean' complains that `Makefile' does not exist or issues a
message like "don't know how to make distclean" it probably means that
the directory is already suitably clean.  However, with the recommended
method of building in a separate OBJDIR, you should simply use a
different OBJDIR for each target.

   Second, when configuring a native system, either `cc' or `gcc' must
be in your path or you must set `CC' in your environment before running
configure.  Otherwise the configuration scripts may fail.

   Note that the bootstrap compiler and the resulting GCC must be link
compatible, else the bootstrap will fail with linker errors about
incompatible object file formats.  Several multilibed targets are
affected by this requirement, see *Note host/target specific
installation notes: Specific.

   To configure GCC:

        % mkdir OBJDIR
        % cd OBJDIR
        % SRCDIR/configure [OPTIONS] [TARGET]

Target specification
====================

   * GCC has code to correctly determine the correct value for TARGET
     for nearly all native systems.  Therefore, we highly recommend you
     not provide a configure target when configuring a native compiler.

   * TARGET must be specified as `--target=TARGET' when configuring a
     cross compiler; examples of valid targets would be i960-rtems,
     m68k-coff, sh-elf, etc.

   * Specifying just TARGET instead of `--target=TARGET' implies that
     the host defaults to TARGET.

Options specification
=====================

   Use OPTIONS to override several configure time options for GCC.  A
list of supported OPTIONS follows; `configure --help' may list other
options, but those not listed below may not work and should not
normally be used.

`--prefix=DIRNAME'
     Specify the toplevel installation directory.  This is the
     recommended way to install the tools into a directory other than
     the default.  The toplevel installation directory defaults to
     `/usr/local'.

     We *highly* recommend against DIRNAME being the same or a
     subdirectory of OBJDIR or vice versa.  If specifying a directory
     beneath a user's home directory tree, some shells will not expand
     DIRNAME correctly if it contains the `~' metacharacter; use
     `$HOME' instead.

     These additional options control where certain parts of the
     distribution are installed.  Normally you should not need to use
     these options.
    `--exec-prefix=DIRNAME'
          Specify the toplevel installation directory for
          architecture-dependent files.  The default is `PREFIX'.

    `--bindir=DIRNAME'
          Specify the installation directory for the executables called
          by users (such as `gcc' and `g++').  The default is
          `EXEC-PREFIX/bin'.

    `--libdir=DIRNAME'
          Specify the installation directory for object code libraries
          and internal parts of GCC.  The default is `EXEC-PREFIX/lib'.

    `--with-slibdir=DIRNAME'
          Specify the installation directory for the shared libgcc
          library.  The default is `LIBDIR'.

    `--infodir=DIRNAME'
          Specify the installation directory for documentation in info
          format.  The default is `PREFIX/info'.

    `--datadir=DIRNAME'
          Specify the installation directory for some
          architecture-independent data files referenced by GCC.  The
          default is `PREFIX/share'.

    `--mandir=DIRNAME'
          Specify the installation directory for manual pages.  The
          default is `PREFIX/man'.  (Note that the manual pages are
          only extracts from the full GCC manuals, which are provided
          in Texinfo format.  The manpages are derived by an automatic
          conversion process from parts of the full manual.)

    `--with-gxx-include-dir=DIRNAME'
          Specify the installation directory for G++ header files.  The
          default is `PREFIX/include/g++-v3'.

`--program-prefix=PREFIX'
     GCC supports some transformations of the names of its programs when
     installing them. This option prepends PREFIX to the names of
     programs to install in BINDIR (see above). For example, specifying
     `--program-prefix=foo-' would result in `gcc' being installed as
     `/usr/local/bin/foo-gcc'.

`--program-suffix=SUFFIX'
     Appends SUFFIX to the names of programs to install in BINDIR (see
     above). For example, specifying `--program-suffix=-3.1' would
     result in `gcc' being installed as `/usr/local/bin/gcc-3.1'.

`--program-transform-name=PATTERN'
     Applies the `sed' script PATTERN to be applied to the names of
     programs to install in BINDIR (see above). PATTERN has to consist
     of one or more basic `sed' editing commands, separated by
     semicolons. For example, if you want the `gcc' program name to be
     transformed to the installed program `/usr/local/bin/myowngcc' and
     the `g++' program name to be transformed to
     `/usr/local/bin/gspecial++' without changing other program names,
     you could use the pattern
     `--program-transform-name='s/^gcc$/myowngcc/; s/^g++$/gspecial++/''
     to achieve this effect.

     All three options can be combined and used together, resulting in
     more complex conversion patterns. As a basic rule, PREFIX (and
     SUFFIX) are prepended (appended) before further transformations
     can happen with a special transformation script PATTERN.

     As currently implemented, this option only takes effect for native
     builds; cross compiler binaries' names are not transformed even
     when a transformation is explicitly asked for by one of these
     options.

     For native builds, some of the installed programs are also
     installed with the target alias in front of their name, as in
     `i686-pc-linux-gnu-gcc'. All of the above transformations happen
     before the target alias is prepended to the name - so, specifying
     `--program-prefix=foo-' and `program-suffix=-3.1', the resulting
     binary would be installed as
     `/usr/local/bin/i686-pc-linux-gnu-foo-gcc-3.1'.

     As a last shortcoming, none of the installed Ada programs are
     transformed yet, which will be fixed in some time.

`--with-local-prefix=DIRNAME'
     Specify the installation directory for local include files.  The
     default is `/usr/local'.  Specify this option if you want the
     compiler to search directory `DIRNAME/include' for locally
     installed header files _instead_ of `/usr/local/include'.

     You should specify `--with-local-prefix' *only* if your site has a
     different convention (not `/usr/local') for where to put
     site-specific files.

     The default value for `--with-local-prefix' is `/usr/local'
     regardless of the value of `--prefix'.  Specifying `--prefix' has
     no effect on which directory GCC searches for local header files.
     This may seem counterintuitive, but actually it is logical.

     The purpose of `--prefix' is to specify where to _install GCC_.
     The local header files in `/usr/local/include'--if you put any in
     that directory--are not part of GCC.  They are part of other
     programs--perhaps many others.  (GCC installs its own header files
     in another directory which is based on the `--prefix' value.)

     Both the local-prefix include directory and the GCC-prefix include
     directory are part of GCC's "system include" directories.
     Although these two directories are not fixed, they need to be
     searched in the proper order for the correct processing of the
     include_next directive.  The local-prefix include directory is
     searched before the GCC-prefix include directory.  Another
     characteristic of system include directories is that pedantic
     warnings are turned off for headers in these directories.

     Some autoconf macros add `-I DIRECTORY' options to the compiler
     command line, to ensure that directories containing installed
     packages' headers are searched.  When DIRECTORY is one of GCC's
     system include directories, GCC will ignore the option so that
     system directories continue to be processed in the correct order.
     This may result in a search order different from what was
     specified but the directory will still be searched.

     GCC automatically searches for ordinary libraries using
     `GCC_EXEC_PREFIX'.  Thus, when the same installation prefix is
     used for both GCC and packages, GCC will automatically search for
     both headers and libraries.  This provides a configuration that is
     easy to use.  GCC behaves in a manner similar to that when it is
     installed as a system compiler in `/usr'.

     Sites that need to install multiple versions of GCC may not want to
     use the above simple configuration.  It is possible to use the
     `--program-prefix', `--program-suffix' and
     `--program-transform-name' options to install multiple versions
     into a single directory, but it may be simpler to use different
     prefixes and the `--with-local-prefix' option to specify the
     location of the site-specific files for each version.  It will
     then be necessary for users to specify explicitly the location of
     local site libraries (e.g., with `LIBRARY_PATH').

     The same value can be used for both `--with-local-prefix' and
     `--prefix' provided it is not `/usr'.  This can be used to avoid
     the default search of `/usr/local/include'.

     *Do not* specify `/usr' as the `--with-local-prefix'!  The
     directory you use for `--with-local-prefix' *must not* contain any
     of the system's standard header files.  If it did contain them,
     certain programs would be miscompiled (including GNU Emacs, on
     certain targets), because this would override and nullify the
     header file corrections made by the `fixincludes' script.

     Indications are that people who use this option use it based on
     mistaken ideas of what it is for.  People use it as if it
     specified where to install part of GCC.  Perhaps they make this
     assumption because installing GCC creates the directory.

`--enable-shared[=PACKAGE[,...]]'
     Build shared versions of libraries, if shared libraries are
     supported on the target platform.  Unlike GCC 2.95.x and earlier,
     shared libraries are enabled by default on all platforms that
     support shared libraries, except for `libobjc' which is built as a
     static library only by default.

     If a list of packages is given as an argument, build shared
     libraries only for the listed packages.  For other packages, only
     static libraries will be built.  Package names currently
     recognized in the GCC tree are `libgcc' (also known as `gcc'),
     `libstdc++' (not `libstdc++-v3'), `libffi', `zlib', `boehm-gc' and
     `libjava'.  Note that `libobjc' does not recognize itself by any
     name, so, if you list package names in `--enable-shared', you will
     only get static Objective-C libraries.  `libf2c' and `libiberty'
     do not support shared libraries at all.

     Use `--disable-shared' to build only static libraries.  Note that
     `--disable-shared' does not accept a list of package names as
     argument, only `--enable-shared' does.

`--with-gnu-as'
     Specify that the compiler should assume that the assembler it
     finds is the GNU assembler.  However, this does not modify the
     rules to find an assembler and will result in confusion if the
     assembler found is not actually the GNU assembler.  (Confusion may
     also result if the compiler finds the GNU assembler but has not
     been configured with `--with-gnu-as'.)  If you have more than one
     assembler installed on your system, you may want to use this
     option in connection with `--with-as=PATHNAME'.

     The following systems are the only ones where it makes a difference
     whether you use the GNU assembler.  On any other system,
     `--with-gnu-as' has no effect.

        * `hppa1.0-ANY-ANY'

        * `hppa1.1-ANY-ANY'

        * `i386-ANY-sysv'

        * `m68k-bull-sysv'

        * `m68k-hp-hpux'

        * `m68000-hp-hpux'

        * `m68000-att-sysv'

        * `ANY-lynx-lynxos'

        * `mips-ANY'

        * `sparc-sun-solaris2.ANY'

        * `sparc64-ANY-solaris2.ANY'

     On the systems listed above (except for the HP-PA, the SPARC, for
     ISC on the 386, and for `mips-sgi-irix5.*'), if you use the GNU
     assembler, you should also use the GNU linker (and specify
     `--with-gnu-ld').

`--with-as=PATHNAME'
     Specify that the compiler should use the assembler pointed to by
     PATHNAME, rather than the one found by the standard rules to find
     an assembler, which are:
        * Check the `EXEC_PREFIX/lib/gcc-lib/TARGET/VERSION' directory,
          where EXEC_PREFIX defaults to PREFIX which defaults to
          `/usr/local' unless overridden by the `--prefix=PATHNAME'
          switch described above. TARGET is the target system triple,
          such as `sparc-sun-solaris2.7', and VERSION denotes the GCC
          version, such as 3.0.

        * Check operating system specific directories (e.g.
          `/usr/ccs/bin' on Sun Solaris 2).
     Note that these rules do not check for the value of `PATH'.  You
     may want to use `--with-as' if no assembler is installed in the
     directories listed above, or if you have multiple assemblers
     installed and want to choose one that is not found by the above
     rules.

`--with-gnu-ld'
     Same as `--with-gnu-as' but for the linker.

`--with-ld=PATHNAME'
     Same as `--with-as' but for the linker.

`--with-stabs'
     Specify that stabs debugging information should be used instead of
     whatever format the host normally uses.  Normally GCC uses the
     same debug format as the host system.

     On MIPS based systems and on Alphas, you must specify whether you
     want GCC to create the normal ECOFF debugging format, or to use
     BSD-style stabs passed through the ECOFF symbol table.  The normal
     ECOFF debug format cannot fully handle languages other than C.
     BSD stabs format can handle other languages, but it only works
     with the GNU debugger GDB.

     Normally, GCC uses the ECOFF debugging format by default; if you
     prefer BSD stabs, specify `--with-stabs' when you configure GCC.

     No matter which default you choose when you configure GCC, the user
     can use the `-gcoff' and `-gstabs+' options to specify explicitly
     the debug format for a particular compilation.

     `--with-stabs' is meaningful on the ISC system on the 386, also, if
     `--with-gas' is used.  It selects use of stabs debugging
     information embedded in COFF output.  This kind of debugging
     information supports C++ well; ordinary COFF debugging information
     does not.

     `--with-stabs' is also meaningful on 386 systems running SVR4.  It
     selects use of stabs debugging information embedded in ELF output.
     The C++ compiler currently (2.6.0) does not support the DWARF
     debugging information normally used on 386 SVR4 platforms; stabs
     provide a workable alternative.  This requires gas and gdb, as the
     normal SVR4 tools can not generate or interpret stabs.

`--disable-multilib'
     Specify that multiple target libraries to support different target
     variants, calling conventions, etc should not be built.  The
     default is to build a predefined set of them.

     Some targets provide finer-grained control over which multilibs
     are built (e.g., `--disable-softfloat'):
    `arc-*-elf*'
          biendian.

    `arm-*-*'
          fpu, 26bit, underscore, interwork, biendian, nofmult.

    `m68*-*-*'
          softfloat, m68881, m68000, m68020.

    `mips*-*-*'
          single-float, biendian, softfloat.

    `powerpc*-*-*, rs6000*-*-*'
          aix64, pthread, softfloat, powercpu, powerpccpu, powerpcos,
          biendian, sysv, aix.

`--enable-threads'
     Specify that the target supports threads.  This affects the
     Objective-C compiler and runtime library, and exception handling
     for other languages like C++ and Java.  On some systems, this is
     the default.

     In general, the best (and, in many cases, the only known) threading
     model available will be configured for use.  Beware that on some
     systems, gcc has not been taught what threading models are
     generally available for the system.  In this case,
     `--enable-threads' is an alias for `--enable-threads=single'.

`--disable-threads'
     Specify that threading support should be disabled for the system.
     This is an alias for `--enable-threads=single'.

`--enable-threads=LIB'
     Specify that LIB is the thread support library.  This affects the
     Objective-C compiler and runtime library, and exception handling
     for other languages like C++ and Java.  The possibilities for LIB
     are:

    `aix'
          AIX thread support.

    `dce'
          DCE thread support.

    `mach'
          Generic MACH thread support, known to work on NeXTSTEP.
          (Please note that the file needed to support this
          configuration, `gthr-mach.h', is missing and thus this
          setting will cause a known bootstrap failure.)

    `no'
          This is an alias for `single'.

    `posix'
          Generic POSIX thread support.

    `pthreads'
          Same as `posix' on arm*-*-linux*, *-*-chorusos* and
          *-*-freebsd* only.  A future release of gcc might remove this
          alias or extend it to all platforms.

    `rtems'
          RTEMS thread support.

    `single'
          Disable thread support, should work for all platforms.

    `solaris'
          Sun Solaris 2 thread support.

    `vxworks'
          VxWorks thread support.

    `win32'
          Microsoft Win32 API thread support.

`--with-cpu=CPU'
     Specify which cpu variant the compiler should generate code for by
     default.  This is currently only supported on some ports,
     specifically arm, powerpc, and SPARC.  If configure does not
     recognize the model name (e.g. arm700, 603e, or ultrasparc) you
     provide, please check the `gcc/config.gcc' script for a complete
     list of supported models.

`--enable-altivec'
     Specify that the target supports AltiVec vector enhancements.  This
     option will adjust the ABI for AltiVec enhancements, as well as
     generate AltiVec code when appropriate.  This option is only
     available for PowerPC systems.

`--enable-target-optspace'
     Specify that target libraries should be optimized for code space
     instead of code speed.  This is the default for the m32r platform.

`--disable-cpp'
     Specify that a user visible `cpp' program should not be installed.

`--with-cpp-install-dir=DIRNAME'
     Specify that the user visible `cpp' program should be installed in
     `PREFIX/DIRNAME/cpp', in addition to BINDIR.

`--enable-initfini-array'
     Force the use of sections `.init_array' and `.fini_array' (instead
     of `.init' and `.fini') for constructors and destructors.  Option
     `--disable-initfini-array' has the opposite effect.  If neither
     option is specified, the configure script will try to guess
     whether the `.init_array' and `.fini_array' sections are supported
     and, if they are, use them.

`--enable-maintainer-mode'
     The build rules that regenerate the GCC master message catalog
     `gcc.pot' are normally disabled.  This is because it can only be
     rebuilt if the complete source tree is present.  If you have
     changed the sources and want to rebuild the catalog, configuring
     with `--enable-maintainer-mode' will enable this.  Note that you
     need a recent version of the `gettext' tools to do so.

`--enable-version-specific-runtime-libs'
     Specify that runtime libraries should be installed in the compiler
     specific subdirectory (`LIBSUBDIR') rather than the usual places.
     In addition, `libstdc++''s include files will be installed in
     `LIBSUBDIR/include/g++' unless you overruled it by using
     `--with-gxx-include-dir=DIRNAME'.  Using this option is
     particularly useful if you intend to use several versions of GCC in
     parallel. This is currently supported by `libf2c' and `libstdc++',
     and is the default for `libobjc' which cannot be changed in this
     case.

`--enable-languages=LANG1,LANG2,...'
     Specify that only a particular subset of compilers and their
     runtime libraries should be built.  For a list of valid values for
     LANGN you can issue the following command in the `gcc' directory
     of your GCC source tree:
          grep language= */config-lang.in
     Currently, you can use any of the following: `ada', `c', `c++',
     `f77', `java', `objc'.  Building the Ada compiler has special
     requirements, see below.
     If you do not pass this flag, all languages available in the `gcc'
     sub-tree will be configured.  Re-defining `LANGUAGES' when calling
     `make bootstrap' *does not* work anymore, as those language
     sub-directories might not have been configured!

`--disable-libgcj'
     Specify that the run-time libraries used by GCJ should not be
     built.  This is useful in case you intend to use GCJ with some
     other run-time, or you're going to install it separately, or it
     just happens not to build on your particular machine.  In general,
     if the Java front end is enabled, the GCJ libraries will be
     enabled too, unless they're known to not work on the target
     platform.  If GCJ is enabled but `libgcj' isn't built, you may
     need to port it; in this case, before modifying the top-level
     `configure.in' so that `libgcj' is enabled by default on this
     platform, you may use `--enable-libgcj' to override the default.

`--with-dwarf2'
     Specify that the compiler should use DWARF 2 debugging information
     as the default.

`--enable-win32-registry'
`--enable-win32-registry=KEY'
`--disable-win32-registry'
     The `--enable-win32-registry' option enables Windows-hosted GCC to
     look up installations paths in the registry using the following
     key:

          `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Free Software Foundation\KEY'

     KEY defaults to GCC version number, and can be overridden by the
     `--enable-win32-registry=KEY' option. Vendors and distributors who
     use custom installers are encouraged to provide a different key,
     perhaps one comprised of vendor name and GCC version number, to
     avoid conflict with existing installations.  This feature is
     enabled by default, and can be disabled by
     `--disable-win32-registry' option.  This option has no effect on
     the other hosts.

`--nfp'
     Specify that the machine does not have a floating point unit.  This
     option only applies to `m68k-sun-sunosN'.  On any other system,
     `--nfp' has no effect.

`--enable-checking'
`--enable-checking=LIST'
     When you specify this option, the compiler is built to perform
     checking of tree node types when referencing fields of that node,
     and some other internal consistency checks.  This does not change
     the generated code, but adds error checking within the compiler.
     This will slow down the compiler and may only work properly if you
     are building the compiler with GCC.  This is on by default when
     building from CVS or snapshots, but off for releases.  More
     control over the checks may be had by specifying LIST; the
     categories of checks available are `misc', `tree', `gc', `rtl',
     `rtlflag', `gcac' and `valgrind'.  The check `valgrind' requires
     the external `valgrind' simulator, available from
     `http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj/'.  The default when LIST is
     not specified is `misc,tree,gc,rtlflag'; the checks `rtl', `gcac'
     and `valgrind' are very expensive.

`--enable-coverage'

`--enable-coverage=LEVEL'
     With this option, the compiler is built to collect self coverage
     information, every time it is run. This is for internal development
     purposes, and only works when the compiler is being built with
     gcc. The LEVEL argument controls whether the compiler is built
     optimized or not, values are `opt' and `noopt'. For coverage
     analysis you want to disable optimization, for performance
     analysis you want to enable optimization. When coverage is
     enabled, the default level is without optimization.

`--enable-nls'
`--disable-nls'
     The `--enable-nls' option enables Native Language Support (NLS),
     which lets GCC output diagnostics in languages other than American
     English.  Native Language Support is enabled by default if not
     doing a canadian cross build.  The `--disable-nls' option disables
     NLS.

`--with-included-gettext'
     If NLS is enabled, the `--with-included-gettext' option causes the
     build procedure to prefer its copy of GNU `gettext'.

`--with-catgets'
     If NLS is enabled, and if the host lacks `gettext' but has the
     inferior `catgets' interface, the GCC build procedure normally
     ignores `catgets' and instead uses GCC's copy of the GNU `gettext'
     library.  The `--with-catgets' option causes the build procedure
     to use the host's `catgets' in this situation.

`--with-libiconv-prefix=DIR'
     Search for libiconv header files in `DIR/include' and libiconv
     library files in `DIR/lib'.

`--with-system-zlib'
     Use installed zlib rather than that included with GCC.  This option
     only applies if the Java front end is being built.

`--enable-obsolete'
     Enable configuration for an obsoleted system.  If you attempt to
     configure GCC for a system (build, host, or target) which has been
     obsoleted, and you do not specify this flag, configure will halt
     with an error message.

     All support for systems which have been obsoleted in one release
     of GCC is removed entirely in the next major release, unless
     someone steps forward to maintain the port.

   Some options which only apply to building cross compilers:
`--with-headers'
`--with-headers=DIR'
     Specifies that target headers are available when building a cross
     compiler.  The DIR argument specifies a directory which has the
     target include files.  These include files will be copied into the
     `gcc' install directory.  _This option with the DIR argument is
     required_ when building a cross compiler, if
     `PREFIX/TARGET/sys-include' doesn't pre-exist.  If
     `PREFIX/TARGET/sys-include' does pre-exist, the DIR argument may
     be omitted.  `fixincludes' will be run on these files to make them
     compatible with GCC.

`--with-libs'
`--with-libs=``DIR1 DIR2 ... DIRN'''
     Specifies a list of directories which contain the target runtime
     libraries.  These libraries will be copied into the `gcc' install
     directory.  If the directory list is omitted, this option has no
     effect.

`--with-newlib'
     Specifies that `newlib' is being used as the target C library.
     This causes `__eprintf' to be omitted from `libgcc.a' on the
     assumption that it will be provided by `newlib'.

   Note that each `--enable' option has a corresponding `--disable'
option and that each `--with' option has a corresponding `--without'
option.

Building
********

   Now that GCC is configured, you are ready to build the compiler and
runtime libraries.

   We *highly* recommend that GCC be built using GNU make; other
versions may work, then again they might not.  GNU make is required for
compiling GNAT (the Ada compiler) and the Java runtime library.

   (For example, many broken versions of make will fail if you use the
recommended setup where OBJDIR is different from SRCDIR.  Other broken
versions may recompile parts of the compiler when installing the
compiler.)

   Some commands executed when making the compiler may fail (return a
nonzero status) and be ignored by `make'.  These failures, which are
often due to files that were not found, are expected, and can safely be
ignored.

   It is normal to have compiler warnings when compiling certain files.
Unless you are a GCC developer, you can generally ignore these warnings
unless they cause compilation to fail.

   On certain old systems, defining certain environment variables such
as `CC' can interfere with the functioning of `make'.

   If you encounter seemingly strange errors when trying to build the
compiler in a directory other than the source directory, it could be
because you have previously configured the compiler in the source
directory.  Make sure you have done all the necessary preparations.

   If you build GCC on a BSD system using a directory stored in an old
System V file system, problems may occur in running `fixincludes' if the
System V file system doesn't support symbolic links.  These problems
result in a failure to fix the declaration of `size_t' in
`sys/types.h'.  If you find that `size_t' is a signed type and that
type mismatches occur, this could be the cause.

   The solution is not to use such a directory for building GCC.

   When building from CVS or snapshots, or if you modify parser sources,
you need the Bison parser generator installed.  Any version 1.25 or
later should work; older versions may also work.  If you do not modify
parser sources, releases contain the Bison-generated files and you do
not need Bison installed to build them.

   When building from CVS or snapshots, or if you modify Texinfo
documentation, you need version 4.2 or later of Texinfo installed if you
want Info documentation to be regenerated.  Releases contain Info
documentation pre-built for the unmodified documentation in the release.

Building a native compiler
==========================

   For a native build issue the command `make bootstrap'.  This will
build the entire GCC system, which includes the following steps:

   * Build host tools necessary to build the compiler such as texinfo,
     bison, gperf.

   * Build target tools for use by the compiler such as binutils (bfd,
     binutils, gas, gprof, ld, and opcodes) if they have been
     individually linked or moved into the top level GCC source tree
     before configuring.

   * Perform a 3-stage bootstrap of the compiler.

   * Perform a comparison test of the stage2 and stage3 compilers.

   * Build runtime libraries using the stage3 compiler from the
     previous step.


   If you are short on disk space you might consider `make
bootstrap-lean' instead.  This is identical to `make bootstrap' except
that object files from the stage1 and stage2 of the 3-stage bootstrap
of the compiler are deleted as soon as they are no longer needed.

   If you want to save additional space during the bootstrap and in the
final installation as well, you can build the compiler binaries without
debugging information as in the following example.  This will save
roughly 40% of disk space both for the bootstrap and the final
installation.  (Libraries will still contain debugging information.)

          make CFLAGS='-O' LIBCFLAGS='-g -O2' \
            LIBCXXFLAGS='-g -O2 -fno-implicit-templates' bootstrap

   If you wish to use non-default GCC flags when compiling the stage2
and stage3 compilers, set `BOOT_CFLAGS' on the command line when doing
`make bootstrap'.  Non-default optimization flags are less well tested
here than the default of `-g -O2', but should still work.  In a few
cases, you may find that you need to specify special flags such as
`-msoft-float' here to complete the bootstrap; or, if the native
compiler miscompiles the stage1 compiler, you may need to work around
this, by choosing `BOOT_CFLAGS' to avoid the parts of the stage1
compiler that were miscompiled, or by using `make bootstrap4' to
increase the number of stages of bootstrap.

   If you used the flag `--enable-languages=...' to restrict the
compilers to be built, only those you've actually enabled will be
built.  This will of course only build those runtime libraries, for
which the particular compiler has been built.  Please note, that
re-defining `LANGUAGES' when calling `make bootstrap' *does not* work
anymore!

   If the comparison of stage2 and stage3 fails, this normally indicates
that the stage2 compiler has compiled GCC incorrectly, and is therefore
a potentially serious bug which you should investigate and report.  (On
a few systems, meaningful comparison of object files is impossible; they
always appear "different".  If you encounter this problem, you will
need to disable comparison in the `Makefile'.)

Building a cross compiler
=========================

   We recommend reading the crossgcc FAQ for information about building
cross compilers.

   When building a cross compiler, it is not generally possible to do a
3-stage bootstrap of the compiler.  This makes for an interesting
problem as parts of GCC can only be built with GCC.

   To build a cross compiler, we first recommend building and
installing a native compiler.  You can then use the native GCC compiler
to build the cross compiler.  The installed native compiler needs to be
GCC version 2.95 or later.

   Assuming you have already installed a native copy of GCC and
configured your cross compiler, issue the command `make', which
performs the following steps:

   * Build host tools necessary to build the compiler such as texinfo,
     bison, gperf.

   * Build target tools for use by the compiler such as binutils (bfd,
     binutils, gas, gprof, ld, and opcodes) if they have been
     individually linked or moved into the top level GCC source tree
     before configuring.

   * Build the compiler (single stage only).

   * Build runtime libraries using the compiler from the previous step.

   Note that if an error occurs in any step the make process will exit.

Building in parallel
====================

   You can use `make bootstrap MAKE="make -j 2" -j 2', or just `make -j
2 bootstrap' for GNU Make 3.79 and above, instead of `make bootstrap'
to build GCC in parallel.  You can also specify a bigger number, and in
most cases using a value greater than the number of processors in your
machine will result in fewer and shorter I/O latency hits, thus
improving overall throughput; this is especially true for slow drives
and network filesystems.

Building the Ada compiler
=========================

   In order to build GNAT, the Ada compiler, you need a working GNAT
compiler (GNAT version 3.13 or later, or GCC version 3.1 or later),
since the Ada front end is written in Ada (with some GNAT-specific
extensions), and GNU make.

   However, you do not need a full installation of GNAT, just the GNAT
binary `gnat1', a copy of `gnatbind', and a compiler driver which can
deal with Ada input (by invoking the `gnat1' binary).  You can specify
this compiler driver by setting the `ADAC' environment variable at the
configure step.  `configure' can detect the driver automatically if it
has got a common name such as `gcc' or `gnatgcc'.  Of course, you still
need a working C compiler (the compiler driver can be different or not).
`configure' does not test whether the GNAT installation works and has a
sufficiently recent version; if too old a GNAT version is installed,
the build will fail unless `--enable-languages' is used to disable
building the Ada front end.

   Additional build tools (such as `gnatmake') or a working GNAT
run-time library installation are usually _not_ required.  However, if
you want to bootstrap the compiler using a minimal version of GNAT, you
have to issue the following commands before invoking `make bootstrap'
(this assumes that you start with an unmodified and consistent source
distribution):

         cd SRCDIR/gcc/ada
         touch treeprs.ads [es]info.h nmake.ad[bs]

   At the moment, the GNAT library and several tools for GNAT are not
built by `make bootstrap'.  You have to invoke `make gnatlib_and_tools'
in the `OBJDIR/gcc' subdirectory before proceeding with the next steps.

   For example, you can build a native Ada compiler by issuing the
following commands (assuming `make' is GNU make):

         cd OBJDIR
         SRCDIR/configure --enable-languages=c,ada
         cd SRCDIR/gcc/ada
         touch treeprs.ads [es]info.h nmake.ad[bs]
         cd OBJDIR
         make bootstrap
         cd gcc
         make gnatlib_and_tools
         cd ..

   Currently, when compiling the Ada front end, you cannot use the
parallel build feature described in the previous section.

Installing GCC: Testing
***********************

   Before you install GCC, we encourage you to run the testsuites and to
compare your results with results from a similar configuration that have
been submitted to the gcc-testresults mailing list.  Some of these
archived results are linked from the build status lists at
`http://gcc.gnu.org/buildstat.html', although not everyone who reports
a successful build runs the testsuites and submits the results.  This
step is optional and may require you to download additional software,
but it can give you confidence in your new GCC installation or point out
problems before you install and start using your new GCC.

   First, you must have downloaded the testsuites.  These are part of
the full distribution, but if you downloaded the "core" compiler plus
any front ends, you must download the testsuites separately.

   Second, you must have the testing tools installed.  This includes
DejaGnu 1.4.2 (or later), Tcl, and Expect; the DejaGnu site has links
to these.

   If the directories where `runtest' and `expect' were installed are
not in the `PATH', you may need to set the following environment
variables appropriately, as in the following example (which assumes
that DejaGnu has been installed under `/usr/local'):

          TCL_LIBRARY = /usr/local/share/tcl8.0
          DEJAGNULIBS = /usr/local/share/dejagnu

   (On systems such as Cygwin, these paths are required to be actual
paths, not mounts or links; presumably this is due to some lack of
portability in the DejaGnu code.)

   Finally, you can run the testsuite (which may take a long time):
          cd OBJDIR; make -k check

   This will test various components of GCC, such as compiler front
ends and runtime libraries.  While running the testsuite, DejaGnu might
emit some harmless messages resembling `WARNING: Couldn't find the
global config file.' or `WARNING: Couldn't find tool init file' that
can be ignored.

How can I run the test suite on selected tests?
===============================================

   In order to run sets of tests selectively, there are targets `make
check-gcc' and `make check-g++' in the `gcc' subdirectory of the object
directory.  You can also just run `make check' in a subdirectory of the
object directory.

   A more selective way to just run all `gcc' execute tests in the
testsuite is to use

         make check-gcc RUNTESTFLAGS="execute.exp OTHER-OPTIONS"

   Likewise, in order to run only the `g++' "old-deja" tests in the
testsuite with filenames matching `9805*', you would use

         make check-g++ RUNTESTFLAGS="old-deja.exp=9805* OTHER-OPTIONS"

   The `*.exp' files are located in the testsuite directories of the GCC
source, the most important ones being `compile.exp', `execute.exp',
`dg.exp' and `old-deja.exp'.  To get a list of the possible `*.exp'
files, pipe the output of `make check' into a file and look at the
`Running ...  .exp' lines.

   The Java runtime tests can be executed via `make check' in the
`TARGET/libjava/testsuite' directory in the build tree.

Additional testing for Java Class Libraries
===========================================

   The Mauve Project provides a suite of tests for the Java Class
Libraries.  This suite can be run as part of libgcj testing by placing
the Mauve tree within the libjava testsuite at
`libjava/testsuite/libjava.mauve/mauve', or by specifying the location
of that tree when invoking `make', as in `make MAUVEDIR=~/mauve check'.

   Jacks is a free test suite that tests Java compiler front ends.
This suite can be run as part of libgcj testing by placing the Jacks
tree within the libjava testsuite at
`libjava/testsuite/libjava.jacks/jacks'.

How to interpret test results
=============================

   The result of running the testsuite are various `*.sum' and `*.log'
files in the testsuite subdirectories.  The `*.log' files contain a
detailed log of the compiler invocations and the corresponding results,
the `*.sum' files summarize the results.  These summaries contain
status codes for all tests:

   * PASS: the test passed as expected

   * XPASS: the test unexpectedly passed

   * FAIL: the test unexpectedly failed

   * XFAIL: the test failed as expected

   * UNSUPPORTED: the test is not supported on this platform

   * ERROR: the testsuite detected an error

   * WARNING: the testsuite detected a possible problem

   It is normal for some tests to report unexpected failures.  At the
current time our testing harness does not allow fine grained control
over whether or not a test is expected to fail.  We expect to fix this
problem in future releases.

Submitting test results
=======================

   If you want to report the results to the GCC project, use the
`contrib/test_summary' shell script.  Start it in the OBJDIR with

         SRCDIR/contrib/test_summary -p your_commentary.txt \
             -m gcc-testresults@gcc.gnu.org |sh

   This script uses the `Mail' program to send the results, so make
sure it is in your `PATH'.  The file `your_commentary.txt' is prepended
to the testsuite summary and should contain any special remarks you
have on your results or your build environment.  Please do not edit the
testsuite result block or the subject line, as these messages may be
automatically processed.


File: gccinstall.info,  Node: Final install,  Prev: Testing,  Up: Installing GCC

Installing GCC: Final installation
**********************************

   Now that GCC has been built (and optionally tested), you can install
it with
     cd OBJDIR; make install

   We strongly recommend to install into a target directory where there
is no previous version of GCC present.

   That step completes the installation of GCC; user level binaries can
be found in `PREFIX/bin' where PREFIX is the value you specified with
the `--prefix' to configure (or `/usr/local' by default).  (If you
specified `--bindir', that directory will be used instead; otherwise,
if you specified `--exec-prefix', `EXEC-PREFIX/bin' will be used.)
Headers for the C++ and Java libraries are installed in
`PREFIX/include'; libraries in `LIBDIR' (normally `PREFIX/lib');
internal parts of the compiler in `LIBDIR/gcc-lib'; documentation in
info format in `INFODIR' (normally `PREFIX/info').

   When installing cross-compilers, GCC's executables are not only
installed into `BINDIR', that is, `EXEC-PREFIX/bin', but additionally
into `EXEC-PREFIX/TARGET-ALIAS/bin', if that directory exists.
Typically, such "tooldirs" hold target-specific binutils, including
assembler and linker.

   Installation into a temporary staging area or into a `chroot' jail
can be achieved with the command

     make DESTDIR=PATH-TO-ROOTDIR install

where PATH-TO-ROOTDIR is the absolute path of a directory relative to
which all installation paths will be interpreted.  Note that the
directory specified by `DESTDIR' need not exist yet; it will be created
if necessary.

   There is a subtle point with tooldirs and `DESTDIR': If you relocate
a cross-compiler installation with e.g. `DESTDIR=ROOTDIR', then the
directory `ROOTDIR/EXEC-PREFIX/TARGET-ALIAS/bin' will be filled with
duplicated GCC executables only if it already exists, it will not be
created otherwise.  This is regarded as a feature, not as a bug,
because it gives slightly more control to the packagers using the
`DESTDIR' feature.

   If you built a released version of GCC using `make bootstrap' then
please quickly review the build status page for your release, available
from `http://gcc.gnu.org/buildstat.html'.  If your system is not listed
for the version of GCC that you built, send a note to <gcc@gcc.gnu.org>
indicating that you successfully built and installed GCC.  Include the
following information:

   * Output from running `SRCDIR/config.guess'.  Do not send us that
     file itself, just the one-line output from running it.

   * The output of `gcc -v' for your newly installed gcc.  This tells
     us which version of GCC you built and the options you passed to
     configure.

   * Whether you enabled all languages or a subset of them.  If you
     used a full distribution then this information is part of the
     configure options in the output of `gcc -v', but if you downloaded
     the "core" compiler plus additional front ends then it isn't
     apparent which ones you built unless you tell us about it.

   * If the build was for GNU/Linux, also include:
        * The distribution name and version (e.g., Red Hat 7.1 or
          Debian 2.2.3); this information should be available from
          `/etc/issue'.

        * The version of the Linux kernel, available from `uname
          --version' or `uname -a'.

        * The version of glibc you used; for RPM-based systems like Red
          Hat, Mandrake, and SuSE type `rpm -q glibc' to get the glibc
          version, and on systems like Debian and Progeny use `dpkg -l
          libc6'.
     For other systems, you can include similar information if you
     think it is relevant.

   * Any other information that you think would be useful to people
     building GCC on the same configuration.  The new entry in the
     build status list will include a link to the archived copy of your
     message.

   We'd also like to know if the *Note host/target specific
installation notes: Specific didn't include your host/target
information or if that information is incomplete or out of date.  Send
a note to <gcc@gcc.gnu.org> telling us how the information should be
changed.

   If you find a bug, please report it following our bug reporting
guidelines.

   If you want to print the GCC manuals, do `cd OBJDIR; make dvi'.  You
will need to have `texi2dvi' (version at least 4.2) and TeX installed.
This creates a number of `.dvi' files in subdirectories of `OBJDIR';
these may be converted for printing with programs such as `dvips'.  You
can also buy printed manuals from the Free Software Foundation, though
such manuals may not be for the most recent version of GCC.

   We are often asked about pre-compiled versions of GCC.  While we
cannot provide these for all platforms, below you'll find links to
binaries for various platforms where creating them by yourself is not
easy due to various reasons.

   Please note that we did not create these binaries, nor do we support
them.  If you have any problems installing them, please contact their
makers.

   * AIX:
        * Bull's Freeware and Shareware Archive for AIX;

        * UCLA Software Library for AIX.

   * DOS--DJGPP.

   * Renesas H8/300[HS]--GNU Development Tools for the Renesas
     H8/300[HS] Series.

   * HP-UX:
        * HP-UX Porting Center;

        * Binaries for HP-UX 11.00 at Aachen University of Technology.

   * The Written Word offers binaries for AIX 4.3.2.  IRIX 6.5, Digital
     UNIX 4.0D and 5.1, GNU/Linux (i386), HP-UX 10.20, 11.00, and
     11.11, and Solaris/SPARC 2.5.1, 2.6, 2.7, 8, and 9,

   In addition to those specific offerings, you can get a binary
distribution CD-ROM from the Free Software Foundation.  It contains
binaries for a number of platforms, and includes not only GCC, but
other stuff as well.  The current CD does not contain the latest
version of GCC, but it should allow bootstrapping the compiler.  An
updated version of that disk is in the works.

Host/target specific installation notes for GCC
***********************************************

   Please read this document carefully _before_ installing the GNU
Compiler Collection on your machine.

alpha*-*-*
==========

   This section contains general configuration information for all
alpha-based platforms using ELF (in particular, ignore this section for
DEC OSF/1, Digital UNIX and Tru64 UNIX).  In addition to reading this
section, please read all other sections that match your target.

   We require binutils 2.11.2 or newer.  Previous binutils releases had
a number of problems with DWARF 2 debugging information, not the least
of which is incorrect linking of shared libraries.

alpha*-dec-osf*
===============

   Systems using processors that implement the DEC Alpha architecture
and are running the DEC/Compaq Unix (DEC OSF/1, Digital UNIX, or Compaq
Tru64 UNIX) operating system, for example the DEC Alpha AXP systems.

   As of GCC 3.2, versions before `alpha*-dec-osf4' are no longer
supported.  (These are the versions which identify themselves as DEC
OSF/1.)

   In Digital Unix V4.0, virtual memory exhausted bootstrap failures
may be fixed by configuring with `--with-gc=simple', reconfiguring
Kernel Virtual Memory and Swap parameters per the `/usr/sbin/sys_check'
Tuning Suggestions, or applying the patch in
`http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2002-08/msg00822.html'.

   In Tru64 UNIX V5.1, Compaq introduced a new assembler that does not
currently (2001-06-13) work with `mips-tfile'.  As a workaround, we
need to use the old assembler, invoked via the barely documented
`-oldas' option.  To bootstrap GCC, you either need to use the Compaq C
Compiler:

        % CC=cc SRCDIR/configure [OPTIONS] [TARGET]

   or you can use a copy of GCC 2.95.3 or higher built on Tru64 UNIX
V4.0:

        % CC=gcc -Wa,-oldas SRCDIR/configure [OPTIONS] [TARGET]

   As of GNU binutils 2.11.2, neither GNU `as' nor GNU `ld' are
supported on Tru64 UNIX, so you must not configure GCC with
`--with-gnu-as' or `--with-gnu-ld'.

   The `--enable-threads' options isn't supported yet.  A patch is in
preparation for a future release.

   GCC writes a `.verstamp' directive to the assembler output file
unless it is built as a cross-compiler.  It gets the version to use from
the system header file `/usr/include/stamp.h'.  If you install a new
version of DEC Unix, you should rebuild GCC to pick up the new version
stamp.

   Note that since the Alpha is a 64-bit architecture, cross-compilers
from 32-bit machines will not generate code as efficient as that
generated when the compiler is running on a 64-bit machine because many
optimizations that depend on being able to represent a word on the
target in an integral value on the host cannot be performed.  Building
cross-compilers on the Alpha for 32-bit machines has only been tested in
a few cases and may not work properly.

   `make compare' may fail on old versions of DEC Unix unless you add
`-save-temps' to `CFLAGS'.  On these systems, the name of the assembler
input file is stored in the object file, and that makes comparison fail
if it differs between the `stage1' and `stage2' compilations.  The
option `-save-temps' forces a fixed name to be used for the assembler
input file, instead of a randomly chosen name in `/tmp'.  Do not add
`-save-temps' unless the comparisons fail without that option.  If you
add `-save-temps', you will have to manually delete the `.i' and `.s'
files after each series of compilations.

   GCC now supports both the native (ECOFF) debugging format used by DBX
and GDB and an encapsulated STABS format for use only with GDB.  See the
discussion of the `--with-stabs' option of `configure' above for more
information on these formats and how to select them.

   There is a bug in DEC's assembler that produces incorrect line
numbers for ECOFF format when the `.align' directive is used.  To work
around this problem, GCC will not emit such alignment directives while
writing ECOFF format debugging information even if optimization is
being performed.  Unfortunately, this has the very undesirable
side-effect that code addresses when `-O' is specified are different
depending on whether or not `-g' is also specified.

   To avoid this behavior, specify `-gstabs+' and use GDB instead of
DBX.  DEC is now aware of this problem with the assembler and hopes to
provide a fix shortly.

alphaev5-cray-unicosmk*
=======================

   Cray T3E systems running Unicos/Mk.

   This port is incomplete and has many known bugs.  We hope to improve
the support for this target soon.  Currently, only the C front end is
supported, and it is not possible to build parallel applications.  Cray
modules are not supported; in particular, Craylibs are assumed to be in
`/opt/ctl/craylibs/craylibs'.

   You absolutely *must* use GNU make on this platform.  Also, you need
to tell GCC where to find the assembler and the linker.  The simplest
way to do so is by providing `--with-as' and `--with-ld' to
`configure', e.g.

         configure --with-as=/opt/ctl/bin/cam --with-ld=/opt/ctl/bin/cld \
           --enable-languages=c

   The comparison test during `make bootstrap' fails on Unicos/Mk
because the assembler inserts timestamps into object files.  You should
be able to work around this by doing `make all' after getting this
failure.

arc-*-elf
=========

   Argonaut ARC processor.  This configuration is intended for embedded
systems.

arm-*-aout
==========

   This configuration is obsoleted in GCC 3.3.

   Advanced RISC Machines ARM-family processors.  These are often used
in embedded applications.  There are no standard Unix configurations.
This configuration corresponds to the basic instruction sequences and
will produce `a.out' format object modules.

   You may need to make a variant of the file `arm.h' for your
particular configuration.

arm-*-elf
=========

   This configuration is intended for embedded systems.

arm*-*-linux-gnu
================

   We require GNU binutils 2.10 or newer.

avr
===

   ATMEL AVR-family micro controllers.  These are used in embedded
applications.  There are no standard Unix configurations.  *Note AVR
Options: (gcc)AVR Options, for the list of supported MCU types.

   Use `configure --target=avr --enable-languages="c"' to configure GCC.

   Further installation notes and other useful information about AVR
tools can also be obtained from:

   * http://www.openavr.org

   * http://home.overta.ru/users/denisc/

   * http://www.amelek.gda.pl/avr/

   We _strongly_ recommend using binutils 2.13 or newer.

   The following error:
       Error: register required

   indicates that you should upgrade to a newer version of the binutils.

c4x
===

   Texas Instruments TMS320C3x and TMS320C4x Floating Point Digital
Signal Processors.  These are used in embedded applications.  There are
no standard Unix configurations.  *Note TMS320C3x/C4x Options:
(gcc)TMS320C3x/C4x Options, for the list of supported MCU types.

   GCC can be configured as a cross compiler for both the C3x and C4x
architectures on the same system.  Use `configure --target=c4x
--enable-languages="c,c++"' to configure.

   Further installation notes and other useful information about C4x
tools can also be obtained from:

   * http://www.elec.canterbury.ac.nz/c4x/

CRIS
====

   CRIS is the CPU architecture in Axis Communications ETRAX
system-on-a-chip series.  These are used in embedded applications.

   *Note CRIS Options: (gcc)CRIS Options, for a list of CRIS-specific
options.

   There are a few different CRIS targets:
`cris-axis-aout'
     Old target.  Includes a multilib for the `elinux' a.out-based
     target.  No multilibs for newer architecture variants.

`cris-axis-elf'
     Mainly for monolithic embedded systems.  Includes a multilib for
     the `v10' core used in `ETRAX 100 LX'.

`cris-axis-linux-gnu'
     A GNU/Linux port for the CRIS architecture, currently targeting
     `ETRAX 100 LX' by default.

   For `cris-axis-aout' and `cris-axis-elf' you need binutils 2.11 or
newer.  For `cris-axis-linux-gnu' you need binutils 2.12 or newer.

   Pre-packaged tools can be obtained from
`ftp://ftp.axis.com/pub/axis/tools/cris/compiler-kit/'.  More
information about this platform is available at
`http://developer.axis.com/'.

DOS
===

   Please have a look at our binaries page.

   You cannot install GCC by itself on MSDOS; it will not compile under
any MSDOS compiler except itself.  You need to get the complete
compilation package DJGPP, which includes binaries as well as sources,
and includes all the necessary compilation tools and libraries.

dsp16xx
=======

   A port to the AT&T DSP1610 family of processors.

*-*-freebsd*
============

   The version of binutils installed in `/usr/bin' is known to work
unless otherwise specified in any per-architecture notes.  However,
binutils 2.12.1 or greater is known to improve overall testsuite
results.

   Support for FreeBSD 1 was discontinued in GCC 3.2.

   For FreeBSD 2 or any mutant a.out versions of FreeBSD 3: All
configuration support and files as shipped with GCC 2.95 are still in
place.  FreeBSD 2.2.7 has been known to bootstrap completely; however,
it is unknown which version of binutils was used (it is assumed that it
was the system copy in `/usr/bin') and C++ EH failures were noted.

   For FreeBSD using the ELF file format: DWARF 2 debugging is now the
default for all CPU architectures.  It had been the default on
FreeBSD/alpha since its inception.  You may use `-gstabs' instead of
`-g', if you really want the old debugging format.  There are no known
issues with mixing object files and libraries with different debugging
formats.  Otherwise, this release of GCC should now match more of the
configuration used in the stock FreeBSD configuration of GCC.  In
particular, `--enable-threads' is now configured by default.  However,
as a general user, do not attempt to replace the system compiler with
this release.  Known to bootstrap and check with good results on
FreeBSD 4.8-STABLE and 5-CURRENT.  In the past, known to bootstrap and
check with good results on FreeBSD 3.0, 3.4, 4.0, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4,
4.5-STABLE.

   In principle, `--enable-threads' is now compatible with
`--enable-libgcj' on FreeBSD.  However, it has only been built and
tested on `i386-*-freebsd[45]' and `alpha-*-freebsd[45]'.  The static
library may be incorrectly built (symbols are missing at link time).
There is a rare timing-based startup hang (probably involves an
assumption about the thread library).  Multi-threaded boehm-gc
(required for libjava) exposes severe threaded signal-handling bugs on
FreeBSD before 4.5-RELEASE.  Other CPU architectures supported by
FreeBSD will require additional configuration tuning in, at the very
least, both boehm-gc and libffi.

   Shared `libgcc_s.so' is now built and installed by default.

h8300-hms
=========

   Renesas H8/300 series of processors.

   Please have a look at our binaries page.

   The calling convention and structure layout has changed in release
2.6.  All code must be recompiled.  The calling convention now passes
the first three arguments in function calls in registers.  Structures
are no longer a multiple of 2 bytes.

hppa*-hp-hpux*
==============

   Support for HP-UX versions 7, 8, and 9 is obsoleted in GCC 3.3.

   We _highly_ recommend using gas/binutils 2.8 or newer on all hppa
platforms; you may encounter a variety of problems when using the HP
assembler.

   Specifically, `-g' does not work on HP-UX (since that system uses a
peculiar debugging format which GCC does not know about), unless you
use GAS and GDB and configure GCC with the `--with-gnu-as' and
`--with-as=...' options.

   If you wish to use the pa-risc 2.0 architecture support with a 32-bit
runtime, you must use either the HP assembler, gas/binutils 2.11 or
newer, or a recent snapshot of gas.

   There are two default scheduling models for instructions.  These are
PROCESSOR_7100LC and PROCESSOR_8000.  They are selected from the pa-risc
architecture specified for the target machine when configuring.
PROCESSOR_8000 is the default.  PROCESSOR_7100LC is selected when the
target is a `hppa1*' machine.

   The PROCESSOR_8000 model is not well suited to older processors.
Thus, it is important to completely specify the machine architecture
when configuring if you want a model other than PROCESSOR_8000.  The
macro TARGET_SCHED_DEFAULT can be defined in BOOT_CFLAGS if a different
default scheduling model is desired.

   More specific information to `hppa*-hp-hpux*' targets follows.

hppa*-hp-hpux9
==============

   Support for this system is obsoleted in GCC 3.3.

   The HP assembler has major problems on this platform.  We've tried
to work around the worst of the problems.  However, those workarounds
may be causing linker crashes in some circumstances; the workarounds
also probably prevent shared libraries from working.  Use the GNU
assembler to avoid these problems.

   The configuration scripts for GCC will also trigger a bug in the
hpux9 shell.  To avoid this problem set `CONFIG_SHELL' to `/bin/ksh'
and `SHELL' to `/bin/ksh' in your environment.

hppa*-hp-hpux10
===============

   For hpux10.20, we _highly_ recommend you pick up the latest sed patch
`PHCO_19798' from HP.  HP has two sites which provide patches free of
charge:

   * `http://us.itrc.hp.com/service/home/home.do' US, Canada,
     Asia-Pacific, and Latin-America.

   * `http://europe.itrc.hp.com/service/home/home.do' Europe.

   The HP assembler on these systems is much better than the hpux9
assembler, but still has some problems.  Most notably the assembler
inserts timestamps into each object file it creates, causing the
3-stage comparison test to fail during a `make bootstrap'.  You should
be able to continue by saying `make all' after getting the failure from
`make bootstrap'.

hppa*-hp-hpux11
===============

   GCC 3.0 and up support HP-UX 11.  On 64-bit capable systems, there
are two distinct ports.  The `hppa2.0w-hp-hpux11*' port generates code
for the 32-bit pa-risc runtime architecture.  It uses the HP linker.
The `hppa64-hp-hpux11*' port generates 64-bit code for the pa-risc 2.0
architecture.  The script config.guess now selects the port type based
on the type compiler detected during configuration.  You must set your
`PATH' or define `CC' so that configure finds an appropriate compiler
for the initial bootstrap.  Different prefixes must be used if both
ports are to be installed on the same system.

   It is best to explicitly configure the `hppa64-hp-hpux11*' target
with the `--with-ld=...' option.  We support both the HP and GNU
linkers for this target.  The two linkers require different link
commands.  Thus, it's not possible to switch linkers during a GCC
build.  This has been been reported to occur in a unified build of
binutils and GCC.

   GCC 2.95.x is not supported under HP-UX 11 and cannot be used to
compile GCC 3.0 and up.  Refer to binaries for information about
obtaining precompiled GCC binaries for HP-UX.

   You must use GNU binutils 2.11 or above with the 32-bit port.  Thread
support is not currently implemented, so `--enable-threads' does not
work.  See:

   * `http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-prs/2002-01/msg00551.html'

   * `http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-bugs/2002-01/msg00663.html'

   GCC 3.3 and later support weak symbols on the 32-bit port using SOM
secondary definition symbols.  This feature is not enabled for earlier
versions of HP-UX since there have been bugs in the linker support for
secondary symbols.  The HP linker patches `PHSS_26559' and `PHSS_24304'
for HP-UX 11.00 and 11.11, respectively, correct the problem of linker
core dumps creating C++ libraries.  Earlier patches may work but they
have not been tested.

   GCC 3.3 nows uses the ELF DT_INIT_ARRAY and DT_FINI_ARRAY capability
to run initializers and finalizers on the 64-bit port.  The feature
requires CVS binutils as of January 2, 2003, or a subsequent release to
correct a problem arising from HP's non-standard use of the .init and
.fini sections.  The 32-bit port uses the linker `+init' and `+fini'
options.  As with the support for secondary symbols, there have been
bugs in the order in which these options are executed by the HP linker.
So, again a recent linker patch is recommended.

   The HP assembler has many limitations and is not recommended for
either the 32 or 64-bit ports.  For example, it does not support weak
symbols or alias definitions.  As a result, explicit template
instantiations are required when using C++.  This will make it
difficult if not impossible to build many C++ applications.  You also
can't generate debugging information when using the HP assembler with
GCC.

   There are a number of issues to consider in selecting which linker to
use with the 64-bit port.  The  GNU 64-bit linker can only create
dynamic binaries.  The `-static' option causes linking with archive
libraries but doesn't produce a truly static binary.  Dynamic binaries
still require final binding by the dynamic loader to resolve a set of
dynamic-loader-defined symbols.  The default behavior of the HP linker
is the same as the GNU linker.  However, it can generate true 64-bit
static binaries using the `+compat' option.

   The HP 64-bit linker doesn't support linkonce semantics.  As a
result, C++ programs have many more sections than they should.

   The GNU 64-bit linker has some issues with shared library support
and exceptions.  As a result, we only support libgcc in archive format.
For similar reasons, dwarf2 unwind and exception support are disabled.
The GNU linker also has problems creating binaries with `-static'.  It
doesn't provide stubs for internal calls to global functions in shared
libraries, so these calls can't be overloaded.

   There are several possible approaches to building the distribution.
Binutils can be built first using the HP tools.  Then, the GCC
distribution can be built.  The second approach is to build GCC first
using the HP tools, then build binutils, then rebuild GCC.  There have
been problems with various binary distributions, so it is best not to
start from a binary distribution.

   When starting with a HP compiler, it is preferable to use the ANSI
compiler as the bundled compiler only supports traditional C.
Bootstrapping with the bundled compiler is tested infrequently and
problems often arise because of the subtle differences in semantics
between traditional and ISO C.

   This port still is undergoing significant development.

i370-*-*
========

   This port is very preliminary and has many known bugs.  We hope to
have a higher-quality port for this machine soon.

*-*-linux-gnu
=============

   Versions of libstdc++-v3 starting with 3.2.1 require bugfixes present
in glibc 2.2.5 and later.  More information is available in the
libstdc++-v3 documentation.

   If you use glibc 2.2 (or 2.1.9x), GCC 2.95.2 won't install
out-of-the-box.  You'll get compile errors while building `libstdc++'.
The patch glibc-2.2.patch, that is to be applied in the GCC source
tree, fixes the compatibility problems.

   Currently Glibc 2.2.3 (and older releases) and GCC 3.0 are out of
sync since the latest exception handling changes for GCC.  Compiling
glibc with GCC 3.0 will give a binary incompatible glibc and therefore
cause lots of problems and might make your system completely unusable.
This will definitely need fixes in glibc but might also need fixes in
GCC.  We strongly advise to wait for glibc 2.2.4 and to read the
release notes of glibc 2.2.4 whether patches for GCC 3.0 are needed.
You can use glibc 2.2.3 with GCC 3.0, just do not try to recompile it.

i?86-*-linux*aout
=================

   Use this configuration to generate `a.out' binaries on Linux-based
GNU systems.  This configuration is being superseded.  You must use
gas/binutils version 2.5.2 or later.

i?86-*-linux*
=============

   As of GCC 3.3, binutils 2.13.1 or later is required for this
platform.  See bug 10877 for more information.

   If you receive Signal 11 errors when building on GNU/Linux, then it
is possible you have a hardware problem.  Further information on this
can be found on www.bitwizard.nl.

i?86-*-sco
==========

   Compilation with RCC is recommended.  Also, it may be a good idea to
link with GNU malloc instead of the malloc that comes with the system.

i?86-*-sco3.2v4
===============

   Use this configuration for SCO release 3.2 version 4.

i?86-*-sco3.2v5*
================

   Use this for the SCO OpenServer Release 5 family of operating
systems.

   Unlike earlier versions of GCC, the ability to generate COFF with
this target is no longer provided.

   Earlier versions of GCC emitted DWARF 1 when generating ELF to allow
the system debugger to be used.  That support was too burdensome to
maintain.  GCC now emits only DWARF 2 for this target.  This means you
may use either the UDK debugger or GDB to debug programs built by this
version of GCC.

   Use of the `-march=pentiumpro' flag can result in unrecognized
opcodes when using the native assembler on OS versions before 5.0.6.
(Support for P6 opcodes was added to the native ELF assembler in that
version.)  While it's rather rare to see these emitted by GCC yet,
errors of the basic form:

       /usr/tmp/ccaNlqBc.s:22:unknown instruction: fcomip
       /usr/tmp/ccaNlqBc.s:50:unknown instruction: fucomip

   are symptoms of this problem.  You may work around this by not
building affected files with that flag, by using the GNU assembler, or
by using the assembler provided with the current version of the OS.
Users of GNU assembler should see the note below for hazards on doing
so.

   The native SCO assembler that is provided with the OS at no charge
is normally required.  If, however, you must be able to use the GNU
assembler (perhaps you're compiling code with asms that require GAS
syntax) you may configure this package using the flags `--with-gnu-as'.
You must use a recent version of GNU binutils; versions past 2.9.1
seem to work well.

   In general, the `--with-gnu-as' option isn't as well tested as the
native assembler.

   Look in `gcc/config/i386/sco5.h' (search for "messy") for additional
OpenServer-specific flags.

   Systems based on OpenServer before 5.0.4 (`uname -X' will tell you
what you're running) require TLS597 from ftp://stage.caldera.com/TLS/
for C++ constructors and destructors to work right.

   The system linker in (at least) 5.0.4 and 5.0.5 will sometimes do
the wrong thing for a construct that GCC will emit for PIC code.  This
can be seen as execution testsuite failures when using `-fPIC' on
`921215-1.c', `931002-1.c', `nestfunc-1.c', and `gcov-1.c'.  For 5.0.5,
an updated linker that will cure this problem is available.  You must
install both ftp://ftp.sco.com/pub/openserver5/rs505a and OSS499A.

   The dynamic linker in OpenServer 5.0.5 (earlier versions may show
the same problem) aborts on certain G77-compiled programs.  It's
particularly likely to be triggered by building Fortran code with the
`-fPIC' flag.  Although it's conceivable that the error could be
triggered by other code, only G77-compiled code has been observed to
cause this abort.  If you are getting core dumps immediately upon
execution of your G77 program--and especially if it's compiled with
`-fPIC'--try applying `sco_osr5_g77.patch' to your `libf2c' and
rebuilding GCC.  Affected faults, when analyzed in a debugger, will
show a stack backtrace with a fault occurring in `rtld()' and the
program running as `/usr/lib/ld.so.1'.  This problem has been reported
to SCO engineering and will hopefully be addressed in later releases.

i?86-*-udk
==========

   This target emulates the SCO Universal Development Kit and requires
that package be installed.  (If it is installed, you will have a
`/udk/usr/ccs/bin/cc' file present.)  It's very much like the
`i?86-*-unixware7*' target but is meant to be used when hosting on a
system where UDK isn't the default compiler such as OpenServer 5 or
Unixware 2.  This target will generate binaries that will run on
OpenServer, Unixware 2, or Unixware 7, with the same warnings and
caveats as the SCO UDK.

   This target is a little tricky to build because we have to
distinguish it from the native tools (so it gets headers, startups, and
libraries from the right place) while making the tools not think we're
actually building a cross compiler.   The easiest way to do this is
with a configure command like this:

         CC=/udk/usr/ccs/bin/cc /YOUR/PATH/TO/gcc/configure \
           --host=i686-pc-udk --target=i686-pc-udk --program-prefix=udk-

   _You should substitute `i686' in the above command with the
appropriate processor for your host._

   After the usual `make bootstrap' and `make install', you can then
access the UDK-targeted GCC tools by adding `udk-' before the commonly
known name.  For example, to invoke the C compiler, you would use
`udk-gcc'.  They will coexist peacefully with any native-target GCC
tools you may have installed.

ia64-*-linux
============

   IA-64 processor (also known as IPF, or Itanium Processor Family)
running GNU/Linux.

   The toolchain is not completely finished, so requirements will
continue to change.  GCC 3.0.1 and later require glibc 2.2.4.  GCC
3.0.2 requires binutils from 2001-09-05 or later.  GCC 3.0.1 requires
binutils 2.11.1 or later.

   None of the following versions of GCC has an ABI that is compatible
with any of the other versions in this list, with the exception that
Red Hat 2.96 and Trillian 000171 are compatible with each other: 3.0.2,
3.0.1, 3.0, Red Hat 2.96, and Trillian 000717.  This primarily affects
C++ programs and programs that create shared libraries.  Because of
these ABI incompatibilities, GCC 3.0.2 is not recommended for user
programs on GNU/Linux systems built using earlier compiler releases.
GCC 3.0.2 is recommended for compiling linux, the kernel.  GCC 3.0.2 is
believed to be fully ABI compliant, and hence no more major ABI changes
are expected.

ia64-*-hpux*
============

   Building GCC on this target requires the GNU Assembler. The bundled
HP assembler will not work. To prevent GCC from using the wrong
assembler, the option `--with-gnu-as' may be necessary.

   The GCC libunwind library has not been ported to HPUX. This means
that for GCC versions 3.2.3 and earlier, `--enable-libunwind-exceptions'
is required to build GCC. For GCC 3.3 and later, this is the default.

*-lynx-lynxos
=============

   Support for SPARC LynxOS is obsoleted in GCC 3.3.

   LynxOS 2.2 and earlier comes with GCC 1.x already installed as
`/bin/gcc'.  You should compile with this instead of `/bin/cc'.  You
can tell GCC to use the GNU assembler and linker, by specifying
`--with-gnu-as --with-gnu-ld' when configuring.  These will produce
COFF format object files and executables;  otherwise GCC will use the
installed tools, which produce `a.out' format executables.

*-ibm-aix*
==========

   Support for AIX versions 1, 2, and 3 is obsoleted in GCC 3.3.

   AIX Make frequently has problems with GCC makefiles.  GNU Make 3.76
or newer is recommended to build on this platform.

   Errors involving `alloca' when building GCC generally are due to an
incorrect definition of `CC' in the Makefile or mixing files compiled
with the native C compiler and GCC.  During the stage1 phase of the
build, the native AIX compiler *must* be invoked as `cc' (not `xlc').
Once `configure' has been informed of `xlc', one needs to use `make
distclean' to remove the configure cache files and ensure that `CC'
environment variable does not provide a definition that will confuse
`configure'.  If this error occurs during stage2 or later, then the
problem most likely is the version of Make (see above).

   The native `as' and `ld' are recommended for bootstrapping on AIX 4
and required for bootstrapping on AIX 5L.  The GNU Assembler reports
that it supports WEAK symbols on AIX 4, which causes GCC to try to
utilize weak symbol functionality although it is not supported.  The GNU
Assembler and Linker do not support AIX 5L sufficiently to bootstrap
GCC.  The native AIX tools do interoperate with GCC.

   Building `libstdc++.a' requires a fix for an AIX Assembler bug APAR
IY26685 (AIX 4.3) or APAR IY25528 (AIX 5.1).

   `libstdc++' in GCC 3.2 increments the major version number of the
shared object and GCC installation places the `libstdc++.a' shared
library in a common location which will overwrite the GCC 3.1 version
of the shared library.  Applications either need to be re-linked
against the new shared library or the GCC 3.1 version of the
`libstdc++' shared object needs to be available to the AIX runtime
loader.  The GCC 3.1 `libstdc++.so.4' shared object can be installed
for runtime dynamic loading using the following steps to set the
`F_LOADONLY' flag in the shared object for _each_ multilib
`libstdc++.a' installed:

   Extract the shared object from each the GCC 3.1 `libstdc++.a'
archive:
        % ar -x libstdc++.a libstdc++.so.4

   Enable the `F_LOADONLY' flag so that the shared object will be
available for runtime dynamic loading, but not linking:
        % strip -e libstdc++.so.4

   Archive the runtime-only shared object in the GCC 3.2 `libstdc++.a'
archive:
        % ar -q libstdc++.a libstdc++.so.4

   Linking executables and shared libraries may produce warnings of
duplicate symbols.  The assembly files generated by GCC for AIX always
have included multiple symbol definitions for certain global variable
and function declarations in the original program.  The warnings should
not prevent the linker from producing a correct library or runnable
executable.

   AIX 4.3 utilizes a "large format" archive to support both 32-bit and
64-bit object modules.  The routines provided in AIX 4.3.0 and AIX 4.3.1
to parse archive libraries did not handle the new format correctly.
These routines are used by GCC and result in error messages during
linking such as "not a COFF file".  The version of the routines shipped
with AIX 4.3.1 should work for a 32-bit environment.  The `-g' option
of the archive command may be used to create archives of 32-bit objects
using the original "small format".  A correct version of the routines
is shipped with AIX 4.3.2 and above.

   Some versions of the AIX binder (linker) can fail with a relocation
overflow severe error when the `-bbigtoc' option is used to link
GCC-produced object files into an executable that overflows the TOC.  A
fix for APAR IX75823 (OVERFLOW DURING LINK WHEN USING GCC AND -BBIGTOC)
is available from IBM Customer Support and from its
techsupport.services.ibm.com website as PTF U455193.

   The AIX 4.3.2.1 linker (bos.rte.bind_cmds Level 4.3.2.1) will dump
core with a segmentation fault when invoked by any version of GCC.  A
fix for APAR IX87327 is available from IBM Customer Support and from its
techsupport.services.ibm.com website as PTF U461879.  This fix is
incorporated in AIX 4.3.3 and above.

   The initial assembler shipped with AIX 4.3.0 generates incorrect
object files.  A fix for APAR IX74254 (64BIT DISASSEMBLED OUTPUT FROM
COMPILER FAILS TO ASSEMBLE/BIND) is available from IBM Customer Support
and from its techsupport.services.ibm.com website as PTF U453956.  This
fix is incorporated in AIX 4.3.1 and above.

   AIX provides National Language Support (NLS).  Compilers and
assemblers use NLS to support locale-specific representations of
various data formats including floating-point numbers (e.g., `.'  vs
`,' for separating decimal fractions).  There have been problems
reported where GCC does not produce the same floating-point formats
that the assembler expects.  If one encounters this problem, set the
`LANG' environment variable to `C' or `En_US'.

   By default, GCC for AIX 4.1 and above produces code that can be used
on both Power or PowerPC processors.

   A default can be specified with the `-mcpu=CPU_TYPE' switch and
using the configure option `--with-cpu-CPU_TYPE'.

ip2k-*-elf
==========

   Ubicom IP2022 micro controller.  This configuration is intended for
embedded systems.  There are no standard Unix configurations.

   Use `configure --target=ip2k-elf --enable-languages=c' to configure
GCC.

m32r-*-elf
==========

   Renesas M32R processor.  This configuration is intended for embedded
systems.

m68000-hp-bsd
=============

   Support for this system is obsoleted in GCC 3.3.

   HP 9000 series 200 running BSD.  Note that the C compiler that comes
with this system cannot compile GCC; contact <law@cygnus.com> to get
binaries of GCC for bootstrapping.

m6811-elf
=========

   Motorola 68HC11 family micro controllers.  These are used in embedded
applications.  There are no standard Unix configurations.

m6812-elf
=========

   Motorola 68HC12 family micro controllers.  These are used in embedded
applications.  There are no standard Unix configurations.

m68k-att-sysv
=============

   Support for this system is obsoleted in GCC 3.3.

   AT&T 3b1, a.k.a. 7300 PC.  This version of GCC cannot be compiled
with the system C compiler, which is too buggy.  You will need to get a
previous version of GCC and use it to bootstrap.  Binaries are
available from the OSU-CIS archive, at
`ftp://ftp.uu.net/systems/att7300/'.

m68k-crds-unos
==============

   Support for this system is obsoleted in GCC 3.3.

   Use `configure unos' for building on Unos.

   The Unos assembler is named `casm' instead of `as'.  For some
strange reason linking `/bin/as' to `/bin/casm' changes the behavior,
and does not work.  So, when installing GCC, you should install the
following script as `as' in the subdirectory where the passes of GCC
are installed:

     #!/bin/sh
     casm $*

   The default Unos library is named `libunos.a' instead of `libc.a'.
To allow GCC to function, either change all references to `-lc' in
`gcc.c' to `-lunos' or link `/lib/libc.a' to `/lib/libunos.a'.

   When compiling GCC with the standard compiler, to overcome bugs in
the support of `alloca', do not use `-O' when making stage 2.  Then use
the stage 2 compiler with `-O' to make the stage 3 compiler.  This
compiler will have the same characteristics as the usual stage 2
compiler on other systems.  Use it to make a stage 4 compiler and
compare that with stage 3 to verify proper compilation.

   (Perhaps simply defining `ALLOCA' in `x-crds' as described in the
comments there will make the above paragraph superfluous.  Please
inform us of whether this works.)

   Unos uses memory segmentation instead of demand paging, so you will
need a lot of memory.  5 Mb is barely enough if no other tasks are
running.  If linking `cc1' fails, try putting the object files into a
library and linking from that library.

m68k-hp-hpux
============

   HP 9000 series 300 or 400 running HP-UX.  HP-UX version 8.0 has a
bug in the assembler that prevents compilation of GCC.  This bug
manifests itself during the first stage of compilation, while building
`libgcc2.a':

     _floatdisf
     cc1: warning: `-g' option not supported on this version of GCC
     cc1: warning: `-g1' option not supported on this version of GCC
     ./xgcc: Internal compiler error: program as got fatal signal 11

   A patched version of the assembler is available as the file
`ftp://altdorf.ai.mit.edu/archive/cph/hpux-8.0-assembler'.  If you have
HP software support, the patch can also be obtained directly from HP,
as described in the following note:

     This is the patched assembler, to patch SR#1653-010439, where the
     assembler aborts on floating point constants.

     The bug is not really in the assembler, but in the shared library
     version of the function "cvtnum(3c)".  The bug on "cvtnum(3c)" is
     SR#4701-078451.  Anyway, the attached assembler uses the archive
     library version of "cvtnum(3c)" and thus does not exhibit the bug.

   This patch is also known as PHCO_4484.

   In addition, if you wish to use gas, you must use gas version 2.1 or
later, and you must use the GNU linker version 2.1 or later.  Earlier
versions of gas relied upon a program which converted the gas output
into the native HP-UX format, but that program has not been kept up to
date.  gdb does not understand that native HP-UX format, so you must
use gas if you wish to use gdb.

   On HP-UX version 8.05, but not on 8.07 or more recent versions, the
`fixproto' shell script triggers a bug in the system shell.  If you
encounter this problem, upgrade your operating system or use BASH (the
GNU shell) to run `fixproto'.  This bug will cause the fixproto program
to report an error of the form:

     ./fixproto: sh internal 1K buffer overflow

   To fix this, you can also change the first line of the fixproto
script to look like:

     #!/bin/ksh

m68k-ncr-*
==========

   Support for this system is obsoleted in GCC 3.3.

   On the Tower models 4N0 and 6N0, by default a process is not allowed
to have more than one megabyte of memory.  GCC cannot compile itself
(or many other programs) with `-O' in that much memory.

   To solve this problem, reconfigure the kernel adding the following
line to the configuration file:

     MAXUMEM = 4096

m68k-sun
========

   Support for this system is obsoleted in GCC 3.3.

   Sun 3.  We do not provide a configuration file to use the Sun FPA by
default, because programs that establish signal handlers for floating
point traps inherently cannot work with the FPA.

m68k-sun-sunos4.1.1
===================

   Support for this system is obsoleted in GCC 3.3.

   It is reported that you may need the GNU assembler on this platform.

mips-*-*
========

   If on a MIPS system you get an error message saying "does not have gp
sections for all it's [sic] sectons [sic]", don't worry about it.  This
happens whenever you use GAS with the MIPS linker, but there is not
really anything wrong, and it is okay to use the output file.  You can
stop such warnings by installing the GNU linker.

   It would be nice to extend GAS to produce the gp tables, but they are
optional, and there should not be a warning about their absence.

   The libstdc++ atomic locking routines for MIPS targets requires MIPS
II and later.  A patch went in just after the GCC 3.3 release to make
`mips*-*-*' use the generic implementation instead.  You can also
configure for `mipsel-elf' as a workaround.  The `mips*-*-linux*'
target continues to use the MIPS II routines.  More work on this is
expected in future releases.

mips-sgi-irix5
==============

   This configuration has considerable problems, which will be fixed in
a future release.

   In order to compile GCC on an SGI running IRIX 5, the
"compiler_dev.hdr" subsystem must be installed from the IDO CD-ROM
supplied by Silicon Graphics.  It is also available for download from
http://www.sgi.com/developers/devtools/apis/ido.html.

   `make compare' may fail on version 5 of IRIX unless you add
`-save-temps' to `CFLAGS'.  On these systems, the name of the assembler
input file is stored in the object file, and that makes comparison fail
if it differs between the `stage1' and `stage2' compilations.  The
option `-save-temps' forces a fixed name to be used for the assembler
input file, instead of a randomly chosen name in `/tmp'.  Do not add
`-save-temps' unless the comparisons fail without that option.  If you
do you `-save-temps', you will have to manually delete the `.i' and
`.s' files after each series of compilations.

   If you use the MIPS C compiler to bootstrap, it may be necessary to
increase its table size for switch statements with the `-Wf,-XNg1500'
option.  If you use the `-O2' optimization option, you also need to use
`-Olimit 3000'.

   To enable debugging under IRIX 5, you must use GNU `as' 2.11.2 or
later, and use the `--with-gnu-as' configure option when configuring
GCC.  GNU `as' is distributed as part of the binutils package.  When
using release 2.11.2, you need to apply a patch
http://sources.redhat.com/ml/binutils/2001-07/msg00352.html which will
be included in the next release of binutils.

   When building GCC, the build process loops rebuilding `cc1' over and
over again.  This happens on `mips-sgi-irix5.2', and possibly other
platforms.  It has been reported that this is a known bug in the `make'
shipped with IRIX 5.2.  We recommend you use GNU `make' instead of the
vendor supplied `make' program; however, you may have success with
`smake' on IRIX 5.2 if you do not have GNU `make' available.

mips-sgi-irix6
==============

   If you are using IRIX `cc' as your bootstrap compiler, you must
ensure that the N32 ABI is in use.  To test this, compile a simple C
file with `cc' and then run `file' on the resulting object file.  The
output should look like:

     test.o: ELF N32 MSB ...

   If you see:

     test.o: ELF 32-bit MSB ...

   or

     test.o: ELF 64-bit MSB ...

   then your version of `cc' uses the O32 or N64 ABI by default.  You
should set the environment variable `CC' to `cc -n32' before
configuring GCC.

   If you want the resulting `gcc' to run on old 32-bit systems with
the MIPS R4400 CPU, you need to ensure that only code for the mips3
instruction set architecture (ISA) is generated.  While GCC 3.x does
this correctly, both GCC 2.95 and SGI's MIPSpro `cc' may change the ISA
depending on the machine where GCC is built.  Using one of them as the
bootstrap compiler may result in mips4 code, which won't run at all on
mips3-only systems.  For the test program above, you should see:

     test.o: ELF N32 MSB mips-3 ...

   If you get:

     test.o: ELF N32 MSB mips-4 ...

   instead, you should set the environment variable `CC' to `cc -n32
-mips3' or `gcc -mips3' respectively before configuring GCC.

   GCC on IRIX 6 is usually built to support both the N32 and N64 ABIs.
If you build GCC on a system that doesn't have the N64 libraries
installed, you need to configure with `--disable-multilib' so GCC
doesn't try to use them.  Look for `/usr/lib64/libc.so.1' to see if you
have the 64-bit libraries installed.

   You must _not_ use GNU `as' (which isn't built anyway as of binutils
2.11.2) on IRIX 6 platforms; doing so will only cause problems.

   GCC does not currently support generating O32 ABI binaries in the
`mips-sgi-irix6' configurations.  It is possible to create a GCC with
O32 ABI only support by configuring it for the `mips-sgi-irix5' target
and using a patched GNU `as' 2.11.2 as documented in the
`mips-sgi-irix5' section above.  Using the native assembler requires
patches to GCC which will be included in a future release.  It is
expected that O32 ABI support will be available again in a future
release.

   The `--enable-threads' option doesn't currently work, a patch is in
preparation for a future release.  The `--enable-libgcj' option is
disabled by default: IRIX 6 uses a very low default limit (20480) for
the command line length.  Although libtool contains a workaround for
this problem, at least the N64 `libgcj' is known not to build despite
this, running into an internal error of the native `ld'.  A sure fix is
to increase this limit (`ncargs') to its maximum of 262144 bytes.  If
you have root access, you can use the `systune' command to do this.

   GCC does not correctly pass/return structures which are smaller than
16 bytes and which are not 8 bytes.  The problem is very involved and
difficult to fix.  It affects a number of other targets also, but IRIX
6 is affected the most, because it is a 64-bit target, and 4 byte
structures are common.  The exact problem is that structures are being
padded at the wrong end, e.g. a 4 byte structure is loaded into the
lower 4 bytes of the register when it should be loaded into the upper 4
bytes of the register.

   GCC is consistent with itself, but not consistent with the SGI C
compiler (and the SGI supplied runtime libraries), so the only failures
that can happen are when there are library functions that take/return
such structures. There are very few such library functions.  Currently
this is known to affect `inet_ntoa', `inet_lnaof', `inet_netof',
`inet_makeaddr', and `semctl'.  Until the bug is fixed, GCC contains
workarounds for the known affected functions.

   See http://freeware.sgi.com/ for more information about using GCC on
IRIX platforms.

powerpc-*-*
===========

   You can specify a default version for the `-mcpu=CPU_TYPE' switch by
using the configure option `--with-cpu-CPU_TYPE'.

powerpc-*-darwin*
=================

   PowerPC running Darwin (Mac OS X kernel).

   Pre-installed versions of Mac OS X may not include any developer
tools, meaning that you will not be able to build GCC from source.  Tool
binaries are available at
`http://developer.apple.com/tools/compilers.html' (free registration
required).

   The default stack limit of 512K is too small, which may cause
compiles to fail with 'Bus error'.  Set the stack larger, for instance
by doing `limit stack 800'.  It's a good idea to use the GNU
preprocessor instead of Apple's `cpp-precomp' during the first stage of
bootstrapping; this is automatic when doing `make bootstrap', but to do
it from the toplevel objdir you will need to say `make CC='cc
-no-cpp-precomp' bootstrap'.

   The version of GCC shipped by Apple typically includes a number of
extensions not available in a standard GCC release.  These extensions
are generally specific to Mac programming.

powerpc-*-elf, powerpc-*-sysv4
==============================

   PowerPC system in big endian mode, running System V.4.

powerpc-*-linux-gnu*

powerpc-*-netbsd*
=================

   PowerPC system in big endian mode running NetBSD.  To build the
documentation you will need Texinfo version 4.2 (NetBSD 1.5.1 included
Texinfo version 3.12).

powerpc-*-eabiaix
=================

   Embedded PowerPC system in big endian mode with `-mcall-aix'
selected as the default.

s390-*-linux*
=============

   S/390 system running Linux for S/390.

s390x-*-linux*
==============

   zSeries system (64-bit) running Linux for zSeries.

*-*-solaris2*
=============

   Sun does not ship a C compiler with Solaris 2.  To bootstrap and
install GCC you first have to install a pre-built compiler, see our
binaries page for details.

   The Solaris 2 `/bin/sh' will often fail to configure `libstdc++-v3',
`boehm-gc' or `libjava'.  We therefore recommend to use the following
sequence of commands to bootstrap and install GCC:

        % CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/ksh
        % export CONFIG_SHELL
        % SRCDIR/configure [OPTIONS] [TARGET]
        % gmake bootstrap
        % gmake install

   As explained in the build instructions, we recommend to use GNU
make, which we call `gmake' here to distinguish it from Sun make.

   Solaris 2 comes with a number of optional OS packages.  Some of these
are needed to use GCC fully, namely `SUNWarc', `SUNWbtool', `SUNWesu',
`SUNWhea', `SUNWlibm', `SUNWsprot', and `SUNWtoo'.  If you did not
install all optional packages when installing Solaris 2, you will need
to verify that the packages that GCC needs are installed.

   To check whether an optional package is installed, use the `pkginfo'
command.  To add an optional package, use the `pkgadd' command.  For
further details, see the Solaris 2 documentation.

   Trying to use the linker and other tools in `/usr/ucb' to install
GCC has been observed to cause trouble.  For example, the linker may
hang indefinitely.  The fix is to remove `/usr/ucb' from your `PATH'.

   The build process works more smoothly with the legacy Sun tools so,
if you have `/usr/xpg4/bin' in your `PATH', we recommend that you place
`/usr/bin' before `/usr/xpg4/bin' for the duration of the build.

   All releases of GNU binutils prior to 2.11.2 have known bugs on this
platform.  We recommend the use of GNU binutils 2.11.2 or the vendor
tools (Sun `as', Sun `ld').

   Sun bug 4296832 turns up when compiling X11 headers with GCC 2.95 or
newer: `g++' will complain that types are missing.  These headers assume
that omitting the type means `int'; this assumption worked for C89 but
is wrong for C++, and is now wrong for C99 also.

   `g++' accepts such (invalid) constructs with the option
`-fpermissive'; it will assume that any missing type is `int' (as
defined by C89).

   There are patches for Solaris 2.6 (105633-56 or newer for SPARC,
106248-42 or newer for Intel), Solaris 7 (108376-21 or newer for SPARC,
108377-20 for Intel), and Solaris 8 (108652-24 or newer for SPARC,
108653-22 for Intel) that fix this bug.

sparc-sun-solaris2*
===================

   When GCC is configured to use binutils 2.11.2 or later the binaries
produced are smaller than the ones produced using Sun's native tools;
this difference is quite significant for binaries containing debugging
information.

   Sun `as' 4.x is broken in that it cannot cope with long symbol names.
A typical error message might look similar to the following:

     /usr/ccs/bin/as: "/var/tmp/ccMsw135.s", line 11041: error:
       can't compute value of an expression involving an external symbol.

   This is Sun bug 4237974.  This is fixed with patch 108908-02 for
Solaris 2.6 and has been fixed in later (5.x) versions of the assembler,
starting with Solaris 7.

   Starting with Solaris 7, the operating system is capable of executing
64-bit SPARC V9 binaries.  GCC 3.1 and later properly supports this;
the `-m64' option enables 64-bit code generation.  However, if all you
want is code tuned for the UltraSPARC CPU, you should try the
`-mtune=ultrasparc' option instead, which produces code that, unlike
full 64-bit code, can still run on non-UltraSPARC machines.

   When configuring on a Solaris 7 or later system that is running a
kernel that supports only 32-bit binaries, one must configure with
`--disable-multilib', since we will not be able to build the 64-bit
target libraries.

sparc-sun-solaris2.7
====================

   Sun patch 107058-01 (1999-01-13) for Solaris 7/SPARC triggers a bug
in the dynamic linker.  This problem (Sun bug 4210064) affects GCC 2.8
and later, including all EGCS releases.  Sun formerly recommended
107058-01 for all Solaris 7 users, but around 1999-09-01 it started to
recommend it only for people who use Sun's compilers.

   Here are some workarounds to this problem:
   * Do not install Sun patch 107058-01 until after Sun releases a
     complete patch for bug 4210064.  This is the simplest course to
     take, unless you must also use Sun's C compiler.  Unfortunately
     107058-01 is preinstalled on some new Solaris 7-based hosts, so
     you may have to back it out.

   * Copy the original, unpatched Solaris 7 `/usr/ccs/bin/as' into
     `/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.7/3.1/as', adjusting
     the latter name to fit your local conventions and software version
     numbers.

   * Install Sun patch 106950-03 (1999-05-25) or later.  Nobody with
     both 107058-01 and 106950-03 installed has reported the bug with
     GCC and Sun's dynamic linker.  This last course of action is
     riskiest, for two reasons.  First, you must install 106950 on all
     hosts that run code generated by GCC; it doesn't suffice to
     install it only on the hosts that run GCC itself.  Second, Sun
     says that 106950-03 is only a partial fix for bug 4210064, but Sun
     doesn't know whether the partial fix is adequate for GCC.
     Revision -08 or later should fix the bug.  The current (as of
     2001-09-24) revision is -14, and is included in the Solaris 7
     Recommended Patch Cluster.

   GCC 3.3 triggers a bug in version 5.0 Alpha 03/27/98 of the Sun
assembler, which causes a bootstrap failure when linking the 64-bit
shared version of libgcc. A typical error message is:

     ld: fatal: relocation error: R_SPARC_32: file libgcc/sparcv9/_muldi3.o:
       symbol <unknown>:  offset 0xffffffff7ec133e7 is non-aligned.

   This bug has been fixed in the final 5.0 version of the assembler.

sparc-sun-sunos4*
=================

   Support for this system is obsoleted in GCC 3.3.

   A bug in the SunOS 4 linker will cause it to crash when linking
`-fPIC' compiled objects (and will therefore not allow you to build
shared libraries).

   To fix this problem you can either use the most recent version of
binutils or get the latest SunOS 4 linker patch (patch ID 100170-10)
from Sun's patch site.

   Sometimes on a Sun 4 you may observe a crash in the program
`genflags' or `genoutput' while building GCC.  This is said to be due
to a bug in `sh'.  You can probably get around it by running `genflags'
or `genoutput' manually and then retrying the `make'.

sparc-unknown-linux-gnulibc1
============================

   Support for this system is obsoleted in GCC 3.3.

   It has been reported that you might need binutils 2.8.1.0.23 for
this platform, too.

sparc-*-linux*
==============

   GCC versions 3.0 and higher require binutils 2.11.2 and glibc 2.2.4
or newer on this platform.  All earlier binutils and glibc releases
mishandled unaligned relocations on `sparc-*-*' targets.

sparc64-*-solaris2*
===================

   The following compiler flags must be specified in the configure step
in order to bootstrap this target with the Sun compiler:

        % CC="cc -xildoff -xarch=v9" SRCDIR/configure [OPTIONS] [TARGET]

   `-xildoff' turns off the incremental linker, and `-xarch=v9'
specifies the SPARC-V9 architecture to the Sun linker and assembler.

sparcv9-*-solaris2*
===================

   This is a synonym for sparc64-*-solaris2*.

*-*-sysv*
=========

   On System V release 3, you may get this error message while linking:

     ld fatal: failed to write symbol name SOMETHING
      in strings table for file WHATEVER

   This probably indicates that the disk is full or your ulimit won't
allow the file to be as large as it needs to be.

   This problem can also result because the kernel parameter `MAXUMEM'
is too small.  If so, you must regenerate the kernel and make the value
much larger.  The default value is reported to be 1024; a value of 32768
is said to work.  Smaller values may also work.

   On System V, if you get an error like this,

     /usr/local/lib/bison.simple: In function `yyparse':
     /usr/local/lib/bison.simple:625: virtual memory exhausted

that too indicates a problem with disk space, ulimit, or `MAXUMEM'.

   On a System V release 4 system, make sure `/usr/bin' precedes
`/usr/ucb' in `PATH'.  The `cc' command in `/usr/ucb' uses libraries
which have bugs.

vax-dec-ultrix
==============

   Don't try compiling with VAX C (`vcc').  It produces incorrect code
in some cases (for example, when `alloca' is used).

xtensa-*-elf
============

   This target is intended for embedded Xtensa systems using the
`newlib' C library.  It uses ELF but does not support shared objects.
Designed-defined instructions specified via the Tensilica Instruction
Extension (TIE) language are only supported through inline assembly.

   The Xtensa configuration information must be specified prior to
building GCC.  The `gcc/config/xtensa/xtensa-config.h' header file
contains the configuration information.  If you created your own Xtensa
configuration with the Xtensa Processor Generator, the downloaded files
include a customized copy of this header file, which you can use to
replace the default header file.

xtensa-*-linux*
===============

   This target is for Xtensa systems running GNU/Linux.  It supports ELF
shared objects and the GNU C library (glibc).  It also generates
position-independent code (PIC) regardless of whether the `-fpic' or
`-fPIC' options are used.  In other respects, this target is the same
as the `xtensa-*-elf' target.

Microsoft Windows (32-bit)
==========================

   A port of GCC 2.95.2 and 3.x is included with the Cygwin environment.

   Current (as of early 2001) snapshots of GCC will build under Cygwin
without modification.

   GCC does not currently build with Microsoft's C++ compiler and there
are no plans to make it do so.

OS/2
====

   GCC does not currently support OS/2.  However, Andrew Zabolotny has
been working on a generic OS/2 port with pgcc.  The current code can be
found at http://www.goof.com/pcg/os2/.

   An older copy of GCC 2.8.1 is included with the EMX tools available
at ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/devtools/emx+gcc/.

Older systems
=============

   GCC contains support files for many older (1980s and early 1990s)
Unix variants.  For the most part, support for these systems has not
been deliberately removed, but it has not been maintained for several
years and may suffer from bitrot.

   Starting with GCC 3.1, each release has a list of "obsoleted"
systems.  Support for these systems is still present in that release,
but `configure' will fail unless the `--enable-obsolete' option is
given.  Unless a maintainer steps forward, support for these systems
will be removed from the next release of GCC.

   Support for old systems as hosts for GCC can cause problems if the
workarounds for compiler, library and operating system bugs affect the
cleanliness or maintainability of the rest of GCC.  In some cases, to
bring GCC up on such a system, if still possible with current GCC, may
require first installing an old version of GCC which did work on that
system, and using it to compile a more recent GCC, to avoid bugs in the
vendor compiler.  Old releases of GCC 1 and GCC 2 are available in the
`old-releases' directory on the GCC mirror sites.  Header bugs may
generally be avoided using `fixincludes', but bugs or deficiencies in
libraries and the operating system may still cause problems.

   Support for older systems as targets for cross-compilation is less
problematic than support for them as hosts for GCC; if an enthusiast
wishes to make such a target work again (including resurrecting any of
the targets that never worked with GCC 2, starting from the last CVS
version before they were removed), patches following the usual
requirements would be likely to be accepted, since they should not
affect the support for more modern targets.

   For some systems, old versions of GNU binutils may also be useful,
and are available from `pub/binutils/old-releases' on
sources.redhat.com mirror sites.

   Some of the information on specific systems above relates to such
older systems, but much of the information about GCC on such systems
(which may no longer be applicable to current GCC) is to be found in
the GCC texinfo manual.

all ELF targets (SVR4, Solaris 2, etc.)
=======================================

   C++ support is significantly better on ELF targets if you use the
GNU linker; duplicate copies of inlines, vtables and template
instantiations will be discarded automatically.

Old installation documentation
******************************

   Note most of this information is out of date and superseded by the
previous chapters of this manual.  It is provided for historical
reference only, because of a lack of volunteers to merge it into the
main manual.

* Menu:

* Configurations::    Configurations Supported by GNU CC.
* Cross-Compiler::   Building and installing a cross-compiler.
* VMS Install::   See below for installation on VMS.

   Here is the procedure for installing GNU CC on a GNU or Unix system.
See *Note VMS Install::, for VMS systems.

  1. If you have chosen a configuration for GNU CC which requires other
     GNU tools (such as GAS or the GNU linker) instead of the standard
     system tools, install the required tools in the build directory
     under the names `as', `ld' or whatever is appropriate.

     Alternatively, you can do subsequent compilation using a value of
     the `PATH' environment variable such that the necessary GNU tools
     come before the standard system tools.

  2. Specify the host, build and target machine configurations.  You do
     this when you run the `configure' script.

     The "build" machine is the system which you are using, the "host"
     machine is the system where you want to run the resulting compiler
     (normally the build machine), and the "target" machine is the
     system for which you want the compiler to generate code.

     If you are building a compiler to produce code for the machine it
     runs on (a native compiler), you normally do not need to specify
     any operands to `configure'; it will try to guess the type of
     machine you are on and use that as the build, host and target
     machines.  So you don't need to specify a configuration when
     building a native compiler unless `configure' cannot figure out
     what your configuration is or guesses wrong.

     In those cases, specify the build machine's "configuration name"
     with the `--host' option; the host and target will default to be
     the same as the host machine.  (If you are building a
     cross-compiler, see *Note Cross-Compiler::.)

     Here is an example:

          ./configure --host=sparc-sun-sunos4.1

     A configuration name may be canonical or it may be more or less
     abbreviated.

     A canonical configuration name has three parts, separated by
     dashes.  It looks like this: `CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM'.  (The three
     parts may themselves contain dashes; `configure' can figure out
     which dashes serve which purpose.)  For example,
     `m68k-sun-sunos4.1' specifies a Sun 3.

     You can also replace parts of the configuration by nicknames or
     aliases.  For example, `sun3' stands for `m68k-sun', so
     `sun3-sunos4.1' is another way to specify a Sun 3.

     You can specify a version number after any of the system types,
     and some of the CPU types.  In most cases, the version is
     irrelevant, and will be ignored.  So you might as well specify the
     version if you know it.

     See *Note Configurations::, for a list of supported configuration
     names and notes on many of the configurations.  You should check
     the notes in that section before proceeding any further with the
     installation of GNU CC.

Configurations Supported by GNU CC
==================================

   Here are the possible CPU types:

     1750a, a29k, alpha, arm, avr, cN, clipper, dsp16xx, elxsi, fr30,
     h8300, hppa1.0, hppa1.1, i370, i386, i486, i586, i686, i786, i860,
     i960, ip2k, m32r, m68000, m68k, m6811, m6812, m88k, mcore, mips,
     mipsel, mips64, mips64el, mn10200, mn10300, ns32k, pdp11, powerpc,
     powerpcle, romp, rs6000, sh, sparc, sparclite, sparc64, v850, vax,
     we32k.

   Here are the recognized company names.  As you can see, customary
abbreviations are used rather than the longer official names.

     acorn, alliant, altos, apollo, apple, att, bull, cbm, convergent,
     convex, crds, dec, dg, dolphin, elxsi, encore, harris, hitachi,
     hp, ibm, intergraph, isi, mips, motorola, ncr, next, ns, omron,
     plexus, sequent, sgi, sony, sun, tti, unicom, wrs.

   The company name is meaningful only to disambiguate when the rest of
the information supplied is insufficient.  You can omit it, writing
just `CPU-SYSTEM', if it is not needed.  For example, `vax-ultrix4.2'
is equivalent to `vax-dec-ultrix4.2'.

   Here is a list of system types:

     386bsd, aix, acis, amigaos, aos, aout, aux, bosx, bsd, clix, coff,
     ctix, cxux, dgux, dynix, ebmon, ecoff, elf, esix, freebsd, hms,
     genix, gnu, linux, linux-gnu, hiux, hpux, iris, irix, isc, luna,
     lynxos, mach, minix, msdos, mvs, netbsd, newsos, nindy, ns, osf,
     osfrose, ptx, riscix, riscos, rtu, sco, sim, solaris, sunos, sym,
     sysv, udi, ultrix, unicos, uniplus, unos, vms, vsta, vxworks,
     winnt, xenix.

You can omit the system type; then `configure' guesses the operating
system from the CPU and company.

   You can add a version number to the system type; this may or may not
make a difference.  For example, you can write `bsd4.3' or `bsd4.4' to
distinguish versions of BSD.  In practice, the version number is most
needed for `sysv3' and `sysv4', which are often treated differently.

   `linux-gnu' is the canonical name for the GNU/Linux target; however
GNU CC will also accept `linux'.  The version of the kernel in use is
not relevant on these systems.  A suffix such as `libc1' or `aout'
distinguishes major versions of the C library; all of the suffixed
versions are obsolete.

   If you specify an impossible combination such as `i860-dg-vms', then
you may get an error message from `configure', or it may ignore part of
the information and do the best it can with the rest.  `configure'
always prints the canonical name for the alternative that it used.  GNU
CC does not support all possible alternatives.

   Often a particular model of machine has a name.  Many machine names
are recognized as aliases for CPU/company combinations.  Thus, the
machine name `sun3', mentioned above, is an alias for `m68k-sun'.
Sometimes we accept a company name as a machine name, when the name is
popularly used for a particular machine.  Here is a table of the known
machine names:

     3300, 3b1, 3bN, 7300, altos3068, altos, apollo68, att-7300,
     balance, convex-cN, crds, decstation-3100, decstation, delta,
     encore, fx2800, gmicro, hp7NN, hp8NN, hp9k2NN, hp9k3NN, hp9k7NN,
     hp9k8NN, iris4d, iris, isi68, m3230, magnum, merlin, miniframe,
     mmax, news-3600, news800, news, next, pbd, pc532, pmax, powerpc,
     powerpcle, ps2, risc-news, rtpc, sun2, sun386i, sun386, sun3,
     sun4, symmetry, tower-32, tower.

Remember that a machine name specifies both the cpu type and the company
name.  If you want to install your own homemade configuration files,
you can use `local' as the company name to access them.  If you use
configuration `CPU-local', the configuration name without the cpu prefix
is used to form the configuration file names.

   Thus, if you specify `m68k-local', configuration uses files
`m68k.md', `local.h', `m68k.c', `xm-local.h', `t-local', and `x-local',
all in the directory `config/m68k'.

   Here is a list of configurations that have special treatment or
special things you must know:

`vax-dec-vms'

     VMS.

Building and Installing a Cross-Compiler
========================================

   GNU CC can function as a cross-compiler for many machines, but not
all.

   * Cross-compilers for the Mips as target using the Mips assembler
     currently do not work, because the auxiliary programs
     `mips-tdump.c' and `mips-tfile.c' can't be compiled on anything
     but a Mips.  It does work to cross compile for a Mips if you use
     the GNU assembler and linker.

   * Cross-compilers between machines with different floating point
     formats have not all been made to work.  GNU CC now has a floating
     point emulator with which these can work, but each target machine
     description needs to be updated to take advantage of it.

   * Cross-compilation between machines of different word sizes is
     somewhat problematic and sometimes does not work.

   Since GNU CC generates assembler code, you probably need a
cross-assembler that GNU CC can run, in order to produce object files.
If you want to link on other than the target machine, you need a
cross-linker as well.  You also need header files and libraries suitable
for the target machine that you can install on the host machine.

* Menu:

* Steps of Cross::      Using a cross-compiler involves several steps
                          that may be carried out on different machines.

File: gccinstall.info,  Node: Steps of Cross,  Next: Configure Cross,  Up: Cross-Compiler

Steps of Cross-Compilation
--------------------------

   To compile and run a program using a cross-compiler involves several
steps:

   * Run the cross-compiler on the host machine to produce assembler
     files for the target machine.  This requires header files for the
     target machine.

   * Assemble the files produced by the cross-compiler.  You can do this
     either with an assembler on the target machine, or with a
     cross-assembler on the host machine.

   * Link those files to make an executable.  You can do this either
     with a linker on the target machine, or with a cross-linker on the
     host machine.  Whichever machine you use, you need libraries and
     certain startup files (typically `crt....o') for the target
     machine.

   It is most convenient to do all of these steps on the same host
machine, since then you can do it all with a single invocation of GNU
CC.  This requires a suitable cross-assembler and cross-linker.  For
some targets, the GNU assembler and linker are available.


File: gccinstall.info,  Node: Configure Cross,  Next: Tools and Libraries,  Prev: Steps of Cross,  Up: Cross-Compiler

Configuring a Cross-Compiler
----------------------------

   To build GNU CC as a cross-compiler, you start out by running
`configure'.  Use the `--target=TARGET' to specify the target type.  If
`configure' was unable to correctly identify the system you are running
on, also specify the `--build=BUILD' option.  For example, here is how
to configure for a cross-compiler that produces code for an HP 68030
system running BSD on a system that `configure' can correctly identify:

     ./configure --target=m68k-hp-bsd4.3


File: gccinstall.info,  Node: Tools and Libraries,  Next: Cross Headers,  Prev: Configure Cross,  Up: Cross-Compiler

Tools and Libraries for a Cross-Compiler
----------------------------------------

   If you have a cross-assembler and cross-linker available, you should
install them now.  Put them in the directory `/usr/local/TARGET/bin'.
Here is a table of the tools you should put in this directory:

`as'
     This should be the cross-assembler.

`ld'
     This should be the cross-linker.

`ar'
     This should be the cross-archiver: a program which can manipulate
     archive files (linker libraries) in the target machine's format.

`ranlib'
     This should be a program to construct a symbol table in an archive
     file.

   The installation of GNU CC will find these programs in that
directory, and copy or link them to the proper place to for the
cross-compiler to find them when run later.

   The easiest way to provide these files is to build the Binutils
package and GAS.  Configure them with the same `--host' and `--target'
options that you use for configuring GNU CC, then build and install
them.  They install their executables automatically into the proper
directory.  Alas, they do not support all the targets that GNU CC
supports.

   If you want to install libraries to use with the cross-compiler,
such as a standard C library, put them in the directory
`/usr/local/TARGET/lib'; installation of GNU CC copies all the files in
that subdirectory into the proper place for GNU CC to find them and
link with them.  Here's an example of copying some libraries from a
target machine:

     ftp TARGET-MACHINE
     lcd /usr/local/TARGET/lib
     cd /lib
     get libc.a
     cd /usr/lib
     get libg.a
     get libm.a
     quit

The precise set of libraries you'll need, and their locations on the
target machine, vary depending on its operating system.

   Many targets require "start files" such as `crt0.o' and `crtn.o'
which are linked into each executable; these too should be placed in
`/usr/local/TARGET/lib'.  There may be several alternatives for
`crt0.o', for use with profiling or other compilation options.  Check
your target's definition of `STARTFILE_SPEC' to find out what start
files it uses.  Here's an example of copying these files from a target
machine:

     ftp TARGET-MACHINE
     lcd /usr/local/TARGET/lib
     prompt
     cd /lib
     mget *crt*.o
     cd /usr/lib
     mget *crt*.o
     quit


File: gccinstall.info,  Node: Cross Headers,  Next: Build Cross,  Prev: Tools and Libraries,  Up: Cross-Compiler

Cross-Compilers and Header Files
--------------------------------

   If you are cross-compiling a standalone program or a program for an
embedded system, then you may not need any header files except the few
that are part of GNU CC (and those of your program).  However, if you
intend to link your program with a standard C library such as `libc.a',
then you probably need to compile with the header files that go with
the library you use.

   The GNU C compiler does not come with these files, because (1) they
are system-specific, and (2) they belong in a C library, not in a
compiler.

   If the GNU C library supports your target machine, then you can get
the header files from there (assuming you actually use the GNU library
when you link your program).

   If your target machine comes with a C compiler, it probably comes
with suitable header files also.  If you make these files accessible
from the host machine, the cross-compiler can use them also.

   Otherwise, you're on your own in finding header files to use when
cross-compiling.

   When you have found suitable header files, you should put them in the
directory `/usr/local/TARGET/include', before building the cross
compiler.  Then installation will run fixincludes properly and install
the corrected versions of the header files where the compiler will use
them.

   Provide the header files before you build the cross-compiler, because
the build stage actually runs the cross-compiler to produce parts of
`libgcc.a'.  (These are the parts that _can_ be compiled with GNU CC.)
Some of them need suitable header files.

   Here's an example showing how to copy the header files from a target
machine.  On the target machine, do this:

     (cd /usr/include; tar cf - .) > tarfile

   Then, on the host machine, do this:

     ftp TARGET-MACHINE
     lcd /usr/local/TARGET/include
     get tarfile
     quit
     tar xf tarfile


File: gccinstall.info,  Node: Build Cross,  Prev: Cross Headers,  Up: Cross-Compiler

Actually Building the Cross-Compiler
------------------------------------

   Now you can proceed just as for compiling a single-machine compiler
through the step of building stage 1.

   Do not try to build stage 2 for a cross-compiler.  It doesn't work to
rebuild GNU CC as a cross-compiler using the cross-compiler, because
that would produce a program that runs on the target machine, not on the
host.  For example, if you compile a 386-to-68030 cross-compiler with
itself, the result will not be right either for the 386 (because it was
compiled into 68030 code) or for the 68030 (because it was configured
for a 386 as the host).  If you want to compile GNU CC into 68030 code,
whether you compile it on a 68030 or with a cross-compiler on a 386, you
must specify a 68030 as the host when you configure it.

   To install the cross-compiler, use `make install', as usual.

Installing GNU CC on VMS
========================

   The VMS version of GNU CC is distributed in a backup saveset
containing both source code and precompiled binaries.

   To install the `gcc' command so you can use the compiler easily, in
the same manner as you use the VMS C compiler, you must install the VMS
CLD file for GNU CC as follows:

  1. Define the VMS logical names `GNU_CC' and `GNU_CC_INCLUDE' to
     point to the directories where the GNU CC executables
     (`gcc-cpp.exe', `gcc-cc1.exe', etc.) and the C include files are
     kept respectively.  This should be done with the commands:

          $ assign /system /translation=concealed -
            disk:[gcc.] gnu_cc
          $ assign /system /translation=concealed -
            disk:[gcc.include.] gnu_cc_include

     with the appropriate disk and directory names.  These commands can
     be placed in your system startup file so they will be executed
     whenever the machine is rebooted.  You may, if you choose, do this
     via the `GCC_INSTALL.COM' script in the `[GCC]' directory.

  2. Install the `GCC' command with the command line:

          $ set command /table=sys$common:[syslib]dcltables -
            /output=sys$common:[syslib]dcltables gnu_cc:[000000]gcc
          $ install replace sys$common:[syslib]dcltables

  3. To install the help file, do the following:

          $ library/help sys$library:helplib.hlb gcc.hlp

     Now you can invoke the compiler with a command like `gcc /verbose
     file.c', which is equivalent to the command `gcc -v -c file.c' in
     Unix.

   If you wish to use GNU C++ you must first install GNU CC, and then
perform the following steps:

  1. Define the VMS logical name `GNU_GXX_INCLUDE' to point to the
     directory where the preprocessor will search for the C++ header
     files.  This can be done with the command:

          $ assign /system /translation=concealed -
            disk:[gcc.gxx_include.] gnu_gxx_include

     with the appropriate disk and directory name.  If you are going to
     be using a C++ runtime library, this is where its install
     procedure will install its header files.

  2. Obtain the file `gcc-cc1plus.exe', and place this in the same
     directory that `gcc-cc1.exe' is kept.

     The GNU C++ compiler can be invoked with a command like `gcc /plus
     /verbose file.cc', which is equivalent to the command `g++ -v -c
     file.cc' in Unix.

   We try to put corresponding binaries and sources on the VMS
distribution tape.  But sometimes the binaries will be from an older
version than the sources, because we don't always have time to update
them.  (Use the `/version' option to determine the version number of
the binaries and compare it with the source file `version.c' to tell
whether this is so.)  In this case, you should use the binaries you get
to recompile the sources.  If you must recompile, here is how:

  1. Execute the command procedure `vmsconfig.com' to set up the files
     `tm.h', `config.h', `aux-output.c', and `md.', and to create files
     `tconfig.h' and `hconfig.h'.  This procedure also creates several
     linker option files used by `make-cc1.com' and a data file used by
     `make-l2.com'.

          $ @vmsconfig.com

  2. Setup the logical names and command tables as defined above.  In
     addition, define the VMS logical name `GNU_BISON' to point at the
     to the directories where the Bison executable is kept.  This
     should be done with the command:

          $ assign /system /translation=concealed -
            disk:[bison.] gnu_bison

     You may, if you choose, use the `INSTALL_BISON.COM' script in the
     `[BISON]' directory.

  3. Install the `BISON' command with the command line:

          $ set command /table=sys$common:[syslib]dcltables -
            /output=sys$common:[syslib]dcltables -
            gnu_bison:[000000]bison
          $ install replace sys$common:[syslib]dcltables

  4. Type `@make-gcc' to recompile everything, or submit the file
     `make-gcc.com' to a batch queue.  If you wish to build the GNU C++
     compiler as well as the GNU CC compiler, you must first edit
     `make-gcc.com' and follow the instructions that appear in the
     comments.

  5. In order to use GCC, you need a library of functions which GCC
     compiled code will call to perform certain tasks, and these
     functions are defined in the file `libgcc2.c'.  To compile this
     you should use the command procedure `make-l2.com', which will
     generate the library `libgcc2.olb'.  `libgcc2.olb' should be built
     using the compiler built from the same distribution that
     `libgcc2.c' came from, and `make-gcc.com' will automatically do
     all of this for you.

     To install the library, use the following commands:

          $ library gnu_cc:[000000]gcclib/delete=(new,eprintf)
          $ library gnu_cc:[000000]gcclib/delete=L_*
          $ library libgcc2/extract=*/output=libgcc2.obj
          $ library gnu_cc:[000000]gcclib libgcc2.obj

     The first command simply removes old modules that will be replaced
     with modules from `libgcc2' under different module names.  The
     modules `new' and `eprintf' may not actually be present in your
     `gcclib.olb'--if the VMS librarian complains about those modules
     not being present, simply ignore the message and continue on with
     the next command.  The second command removes the modules that
     came from the previous version of the library `libgcc2.c'.

     Whenever you update the compiler on your system, you should also
     update the library with the above procedure.

  6. You may wish to build GCC in such a way that no files are written
     to the directory where the source files reside.  An example would
     be the when the source files are on a read-only disk.  In these
     cases, execute the following DCL commands (substituting your
     actual path names):

          $ assign dua0:[gcc.build_dir.]/translation=concealed, -
                   dua1:[gcc.source_dir.]/translation=concealed  gcc_build
          $ set default gcc_build:[000000]

     where the directory `dua1:[gcc.source_dir]' contains the source
     code, and the directory `dua0:[gcc.build_dir]' is meant to contain
     all of the generated object files and executables.  Once you have
     done this, you can proceed building GCC as described above.  (Keep
     in mind that `gcc_build' is a rooted logical name, and thus the
     device names in each element of the search list must be an actual
     physical device name rather than another rooted logical name).

  7. *If you are building GNU CC with a previous version of GNU CC, you
     also should check to see that you have the newest version of the
     assembler*.  In particular, GNU CC version 2 treats global constant
     variables slightly differently from GNU CC version 1, and GAS
     version 1.38.1 does not have the patches required to work with GCC
     version 2.  If you use GAS 1.38.1, then `extern const' variables
     will not have the read-only bit set, and the linker will generate
     warning messages about mismatched psect attributes for these
     variables.  These warning messages are merely a nuisance, and can
     safely be ignored.

  8. If you want to build GNU CC with the VAX C compiler, you will need
     to make minor changes in `make-cccp.com' and `make-cc1.com' to
     choose alternate definitions of `CC', `CFLAGS', and `LIBS'.  See
     comments in those files.  However, you must also have a working
     version of the GNU assembler (GNU as, aka GAS) as it is used as
     the back end for GNU CC to produce binary object modules and is
     not included in the GNU CC sources.  GAS is also needed to compile
     `libgcc2' in order to build `gcclib' (see above); `make-l2.com'
     expects to be able to find it operational in
     `gnu_cc:[000000]gnu-as.exe'.

     To use GNU CC on VMS, you need the VMS driver programs `gcc.exe',
     `gcc.com', and `gcc.cld'.  They are distributed with the VMS
     binaries (`gcc-vms') rather than the GNU CC sources.  GAS is also
     included in `gcc-vms', as is Bison.

     Once you have successfully built GNU CC with VAX C, you should use
     the resulting compiler to rebuild itself.  Before doing this, be
     sure to restore the `CC', `CFLAGS', and `LIBS' definitions in
     `make-cccp.com' and `make-cc1.com'.  The second generation
     compiler will be able to take advantage of many optimizations that
     must be suppressed when building with other compilers.

   Under previous versions of GNU CC, the generated code would
occasionally give strange results when linked with the sharable
`VAXCRTL' library.  Now this should work.

   Even with this version, however, GNU CC itself should not be linked
with the sharable `VAXCRTL'.  The version of `qsort' in `VAXCRTL' has a
bug (known to be present in VMS versions V4.6 through V5.5) which
causes the compiler to fail.

   The executables are generated by `make-cc1.com' and `make-cccp.com'
use the object library version of `VAXCRTL' in order to make use of the
`qsort' routine in `gcclib.olb'.  If you wish to link the compiler
executables with the shareable image version of `VAXCRTL', you should
edit the file `tm.h' (created by `vmsconfig.com') to define the macro
`QSORT_WORKAROUND'.

   `QSORT_WORKAROUND' is always defined when GNU CC is compiled with
VAX C, to avoid a problem in case `gcclib.olb' is not yet available.

******************************

                      Version 1.2, November 2002
     Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warrany Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

   To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
       A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
