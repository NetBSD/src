1996-06-18 15:12  Ulrich Drepper  <drepper@cygnus.com>

	* gettextize.in (aclocal_version): new variable.  Value determined
	by configure.  This finally makes the check of the aclocal.m4
	version number correct because this number need not be the same as
	the version number of the package.

1996-06-06 02:02  Ulrich Drepper  <drepper@cygnus.com>

	* gettextize.in: Rewrite copying now that files are kept in

1996-06-05 16:36  Ulrich Drepper  <drepper@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.am (DISTCLEANFILES): Renamed from CLEANFILES and

	* po-mode.el: * Let po-show-source-context update
	po-reference-cursor itself, and display to the minibuffer the
	relative and maximum position of the shown reference in the list
	of collected references.  Callers adjusted accordingly.
	. Do not generate tildes while reconstructing non-obsolete
	comments.
	. Do merge attributes on a single `#,' line.  Using the non-regexp
	version of the search was causing the generation of another one.
	. Remove a spurious trailing comma while removing the last
	attribute.
	. Limit the search for source references to the msgstr line.  This
	does not correct any bug, but is more consistent.

1996-03-31 23:32  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* po-mode.el: * Small corrections to the help page.  Reported by
	Karl Eichwalder.

	were not consistent.  Reported by Karl Eichwalder.

	* Repair RET, completely broken for multi-lines, maybe showing a
	regexp bug in Emacs(?).  See the FIXME in po-extract-unquoted.
	Reported by Karl Eichwalder.

1996-03-31 22:36  Ulrich Drepper  <drepper@myware>

	* gettextize.in (prefix): Define from @prefix@.  Is used in

	Reported by Karl Eichwalder.

	* Rename po-auto-select to po-auto-select-entry.

	* Revise text of all disruptive questions, try to alleviate
	them, avoid them if possible.  Clear the message area sometimes.

	* Correct a bug by which `#! fuzzy' was inserted before the
	white line, instead of after, for PO files having no `#' line
	of any kind.

	* Correct the message count updating in po-kill-msgstr and
	po-yank-msgstr.

	* Allow for po-auto-edit-with-msgid to work, when
	po-edit-msgstr was called on an untranslated immediately after
	loading a PO file.

	* po-quit may select all kind of not fully processed entries,
	rather than just untranslate ones.

	Rebound commands:
	* TAB moves to LFD for po-msgid-to-msgstr.
	* z moves to DEL for po-fade-out-entry.

	New commands:
	* TAB is po-unfuzzy.
	* SPC is po-auto-select.
	* t is po-next-translated entry.
	* M-t is po-previous-translated-entry.
	* E is po-edit-out-full.

	Improved commands:
	* DEL (po-fade-out-entry) makes the entry fuzzy as first step,
	and request confirmation for some transitions.
	* LFD (po-msgid-to-msgstr) requests confirmation if entry was
	already translated.
	* v (po-validate): Pass the -v flag to msgfmt.
	* q (po-confirm-and-quit): Use milder confirmation.
	* Implemented variables po-auto-edit-with-msgid,
	po-auto-fuzzy-on-edit, po-auto-select-on-unfuzzy, and
	po-auto-replace-revision-date.

	PO header management:
	* PO-Revision-Date might be automatically updated.
	Reported by Karl Eichwalder.
	* A normalized PO file header is automatically created if it
	not exists.  Any previous PO file header is kept, obsoleted.

	Various internal cleanups:
	* Revised the PO mode summary display.
	* ...-hooks renamed ...-hook, per word of Richard Stallman.
	* po-obsolete-flag replaced by more general po-entry-type.
	* po-appropriate-counter, po-increase-appropriate-counter and
	po-decrease-appropriate-counter are replaced by	po-type-counter,
	po-decrease-type-counter and po-increase-type-counter.
	Overall counting logic revised and cleaned up.
	* The concept of being after last entry disappears.  Being
	after last entry is equivalent to being on last entry.  And
	since there is at least the PO header entry, and an empty PO
	file is not possible anymore: simplified code accordingly.
	* po-add-attribute, po-delete-attribute: New functions.
	* po-offer-validation disappears, as (buffer-modified-p) may
	be used instead.

1996-03-14 16:55  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	for PO editing mode, besides .po and .pox.
	* PO mode help display has been revised to fit in 23 lines,

	initially suggests using `h' or `?' for documentation.
	* Many variables and functions have been renamed for more
	clarity and consistency, too numerous to be detailed here.
	* Reorganization of key-bindings.  This restores to M-w and M-y
	their usual meaning, and free some keys for to-be-implemented
	commands: the a/M-a/A/M-A series for auxiliary files, c/M-c
	for compendium files, and l/M-l/L/M-L series for lexicon files.
	. Commands u, v, o and q have been renamed U, V, O and Q
	  (po-undo, po-validate, po-other-window and po-quit).
	. Command v replaces old command V (po-mode-version).
	. u and SPC replace e (po-next-untranslated-entry).
	  M-u replaces M-e (po-previous-untranslated-entry).
	. o replaces M-n and M-SPC (po-next-obsolete-entry).
	  M-o replaces M-p and M-DEL (po-previous-obsolete-entry).
	. SPC, DEL, and M-RET are no more po-next-entry,
	  po-previous-entry and po-edit-comment.
	. r replaces l (po-pop-location).
	. s (po-cycle-source-reference) replaces c (po-cycle-reference).
	  M-s (po-select-source-reference) replaces M-c (po-select-reference).
	  S (po-consider-source-path) replaces d (po-add-path).
	  M-S (po-ignore-source-path) replaces M-d (po-delete-path).
	. K, W and Y replace M-k, M-w and M-y (po-kill-comment,
	  po-kill-ring-save-comment and po-yank-comment).
	* New command q (po-confirm-and-quit).
