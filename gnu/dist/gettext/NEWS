Version 0.10.35 - April 1998, by Ulrich Drepper

* by default the emulation of gettext using the catgets() functions of
  the C library is not selected anymore.  GNU gettext has so many nice
  extensions that this became unreasonable.  Using --with-catgets the
  emulation still can be requested.

* extend xgettext program to handle other file formats other than C/C++.
  For now it also handles PO file.  Using this feature one can concatenate
  arbitrary PO files.

* Tcl module with gettext interface

* Korean translation by Bang Jun Young

* xgettext writes to stdout when default domain name is set to -

* codeset name normalization

* msgmerge program now has all features tupdate has (and more).
  tupdate itself will be removed soon

* po/Makefile.in.in now uses msgmerge instead of tupdate

* escape notation in .po files are only used when explicitly selected

* changed interface of msgunfmt to conform to GNU coding standard

* msgmerge now knows how to handle obsolete entries.  If a formerly obsolete
  entry is used again msgmerge will find it

* better implementation of comment extraction in xgettext.

* better C format string implementation.  The xgettext will classify
  strings as being a format string, or not, in the .po file.  The
  programmer can override the decision explicitly for each string
  by specifying `xgettext:c-format' and `xgettext:no-c-format'
  respectively in a C comment preceding the string.

* msgmerge program now always produces output.  Fuzzy or non-existing
  translations are no reason for holding back the result.

* reasonable header entry format implemented

* Norwegian translation by Karl Anders Øygard

* Configure command line option `--with-gnu-gettext' is renamed to
  `--with-included-gettext'

* gettextize now can determine whether the aclocal.m4 of the project
  is sufficent

* use automake for Makefile.in generation

* by default now only c-format is emitted in xgettext.  If using the new
  --debug option one can enable printing possible-c-format to see who
  decided about the string: xgettext or the programmer

* the installed libintl.h file no longer depends on HAVE_LOCALE_H being
  defined.  After running configure we know whether this file exists.

* wrapping of lines in PO file output finally enabled.
  A new special comment no-wrap prevents wrapping.

* add --statistics option to msgfmt to get information about number of
  translated, untranslated, and fuzzy messages

* change behaviour of --verbose option to msgfmt.  This no longer
  causes the check on the messages to be performed.  The check for leading
  and trailing \n is always performed and the check of the format specifiers
  is performed when --check is given.

* shared library support based On Gord Matzigkeit's libtool package

* msgcomm program by Peter Miller to extract messages shared by input
  files

* many more translations.

Version 0.10 - December 1995, by Ulrich Drepper

* implement --shell-script option for gettext program

* implement object-oriented, lazy message handling :-)
  Consult the manual for more/any information

* implement locale name aliasing, similar to the one used
  in the X Window System

* support for GNU gettext sources in central place to support
  use in development environments of other projects

* implement CEN syntax for environment variable values

* msgcmp program to find matches in two .po files

* programs now have exit status != 0 if errors occured

* libintl.a is now selfcontained and can be used without context in
  other projects (even on systems missing alloca)

* gettextize now automatically runs config.status

* swedish message catalog

* new options for xgettext: -D/--directory to change in specified directory
  before processing the input files and -f/--files-from to specify file from
  which the names of the input files are read.
  The later option in necessary for large projects such as GNU C Library.

* new programs msgmerge and msgunfmt by Peter Miller.  The code of the other
  programs is now also much cleaner.

Version 0.9 - August 1995, by Ulrich Drepper

* again many improvements on the manual

* norwegian message catalog

* compilation now works with --disable-nls

* better checks

Version 0.8 - July 1995, by Ulrich Drepper

* much improved manual (although still far from being complete)

* improved PO mode; it now can prepare C sources for use with gettext
  by marking translatable strings

* better support for sparse System V systems

* check goal (kind of)

* more input tests and warnings

* better support for integration in other packages

* many bugs fixed

Version 0.7 - June 1995, by Ulrich Drepper

* New GNU package providing functionality to internationalize and
localize other programs.

* Implementation of the Uniforum(*) proposal for internationalization
on top of X/Open(*) style catgets functions.

* Complete implementation of the Uniforum functions for system
lacking either of them or those who which to have a different
implementation with many advantages.

* Implementation of the three tools for message catalog handling
described in the Uniforum.

* Emacs po-mode for handling portable message object files which are
the basis of the work of the package.


(*) Some history:  The POSIX working groups have so far been unable to
agree on one set of message catalog handling functions for the C Library.
For now there are competing proposals, one by the Uniforum group, led by
Sun, and the other by X/Open.  Although the latter is surely implemented
on more systems, it is not perceived as the clear leader.
