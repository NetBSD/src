TAPE_FILE=/dev/nrsmt0

# Command to obtain status of tape drive, including error count.
# On some tape drives there may not be such a command;
# then simply use `TAPE_STATUS=false'.
#
# Might also consider
#    TAPE_STATUS="mt -f ${TAPE_FILE} status"

# Name of temporary file to hold volume numbers.  This needs to be accessible

# Script to be run when it's time to insert a new tape in for the next
# volume.  Administrators may want to tailor this script for their site. 
# If this variable isn't set, tar will use some default behavior which is
# probably defined in the manual. 
#DUMP_REMIND_SCRIPT='rsh apple-gunkies /home/gd2/dump/dump-remind'

# List of file systems to be dumped.
# Actually, any directory may be used, but if it has subdirectories on
# other file systems, they are not included.
# The host name specifies which host to run tar on.
# It should normally be the host that actually has the file system.
# If GNU tar is not installed on that machine, then you can specify some
# other host which can access the file system through NFS.
# Although these are arranged one per line, that is not mandatory.
# It does not work to use # for comments within the string.
