Despite a serious lack of sex-appeal, email via UUCP over TCP is a practical
option for sites without permanent Internet connection, and for sites without a
fixed IP address. For first-hand information, see the following guides:

  * Jim Seymour's guide for using UUCP over TCP at http://jimsun.LinxNet.com/
    jdp/uucp_over_tcp/index.html,
  * Craig Sanders's guide for SSL-encrypted UUCP over TCP using stunnel at
    http://taz.net.au/postfix/uucp/.

Here's a graphical description of what this document is about:

    Local network <--->  UUCP   <--- UUCP ---> to UUCP  <---> Internet

Here is how to set up a machine that sits on the Internet and that forwards
mail to a LAN that is connected via UUCP. See the LAN to UUCP gateway section
for the other side of the story.

  * You need an rrmmaaiill program that extracts the sender address from mail that
    arrives via UUCP, and that feeds the mail into the Postfix sseennddmmaaiill
    command. Most UNIX systems come with an rrmmaaiill utility. If you're in a
    pinch, try the one bundled with the Postfix source code in the aauuxxiilliiaarryy//
    rrmmaaiill directory.

  * Define a pipe(8) based mail delivery transport for delivery via UUCP:

    /etc/postfix/master.cf:
        uucp      unix  -       n       n       -       -       pipe
          flags=F user=uucp argv=uux -r -n -z -a$sender - $nexthop!rmail
    ($recipient)

    This runs the uuuuxx command to place outgoing mail into the UUCP queue after
    replacing $nexthop by the next-hop hostname (the receiving UUCP host) and
    after replacing $recipient by the recipients. The pipe(8) delivery agent
    executes the uuuuxx command without assistance from the shell, so there are no
    problems with shell meta characters in command-line parameters.

  * Specify that mail for example.com, should be delivered via UUCP, to a host
    named uucp-host:

    /etc/postfix/transport:
        example.com     uucp:uucp-host
        .example.com    uucp:uucp-host

    See the transport(5) manual page for more details.

  * Execute the command "ppoossttmmaapp //eettcc//ppoossttffiixx//ttrraannssppoorrtt" whenever you change
    the ttrraannssppoorrtt file.

  * Enable ttrraannssppoorrtt table lookups:

    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport

    Specify ddbbmm instead of hhaasshh if your system uses ddbbmm files instead of ddbb
    files. To find out what map types Postfix supports, use the command
    "ppoossttccoonnff --mm".

  * Add example.com to the list of domains that your site is willing to relay
    mail for.

    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        relay_domains = example.com ...other relay domains...

    See the relay_domains configuration parameter description for details.

  * Execute the command "ppoossttffiixx rreellooaadd" to make the changes effective.

Here is how to relay mail from a LAN via UUCP to the Internet. See the Internet
to UUCP gateway section for the other side of the story.

  * You need an rrmmaaiill program that extracts the sender address from mail that
    arrives via UUCP, and that feeds the mail into the Postfix sseennddmmaaiill
    command. Most UNIX systems come with an rrmmaaiill utility. If you're in a
    pinch, try the one bundled with the Postfix source code in the aauuxxiilliiaarryy//
    rrmmaaiill directory.

  * Specify that all remote mail must be sent via the uuuuccpp mail transport to
    your UUCP gateway host, say, uucp-gateway:

    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        relayhost = uucp-gateway
        default_transport = uucp

    Postfix 2.0 and later also allows the following more succinct form:

    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        default_transport = uucp:uucp-gateway

  * Define a pipe(8) based message delivery transport for mail delivery via
    UUCP:

    /etc/postfix/master.cf:
        uucp      unix  -       n       n       -       -       pipe
          flags=F user=uucp argv=uux -r -n -z -a$sender - $nexthop!rmail
    ($recipient)

    This runs the uuuuxx command to place outgoing mail into the UUCP queue. It
    substitutes the next-hop hostname (uucp-gateway, or whatever you specified)
    and the recipients before executing the command. The uuuuxx command is
    executed without assistance from the shell, so there are no problems with
    shell meta characters.

  * Execute the command "ppoossttffiixx rreellooaadd" to make the changes effective.
