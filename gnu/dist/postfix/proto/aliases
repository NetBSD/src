# NAME
#	aliases 5
# SUMMARY
#	format of the Postfix alias database
# SYNOPSIS
# .fi
#	\fBnewaliases\fR
# DESCRIPTION
#	The \fBaliases\fR table provides a system-wide mechanism to
#	redirect mail for local recipients. The redirections are
#	processed by the Postfix \fBlocal\fR(8) delivery agent.
#
#	Normally, the \fBaliases\fR table is specified as a text file
#	that serves as input to the \fBpostalias\fR(1) command. The
#	result, an indexed file in \fBdbm\fR or \fBdb\fR format, is
#	used for fast lookup by the mail system. Execute the command
#	\fBnewaliases\fR in order to rebuild the indexed file after
#	changing the Postfix alias database.
#
#	The input and output file formats are expected to be compatible
#	with Sendmail version 8, and are expected to be suitable for the
#	use as NIS maps.
#
#	Users can control delivery of their own mail by setting
#	up \fB.forward\fR files in their home directory.
#	Lines in per-user \fB.forward\fR files have the same syntax
#	as the right-hand side of \fBaliases\fR entries.
#
#	The format of the alias database input file is as follows:
# .IP \(bu
#	An alias definition has the form
# .sp
# .ti +5
#	\fIname\fR: \fIvalue1\fR, \fIvalue2\fR, \fI...\fR
# .IP \(bu
#	Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored, as
#	are lines whose first non-whitespace character is a `#'.
# .IP \(bu
#	A logical line starts with non-whitespace text. A line that
#	starts with whitespace continues a logical line.
# .PP
#	The \fIname\fR is a local address (no domain part).
#	Use double quotes when the name contains any special characters
#	such as whitespace, `#', `:', or `@'. The \fIname\fR is folded to
#	lowercase, in order to make database lookups case insensitive.
# .PP
#	In addition, when an alias exists for \fBowner-\fIname\fR, delivery
#	diagnostics are directed to that address, instead of to the originator.
#	This is typically used to direct delivery errors to the owner of
#	a mailing list, who is in a better position to deal with mailing
#	list delivery problems than the originator of the undelivered mail.
# .PP
#	The \fIvalue\fR contains one or more of the following:
# .IP \fIaddress\fR
#	Mail is forwarded to \fIaddress\fR, which is compatible
#	with the RFC 822 standard.
# .IP \fI/file/name\fR
#	Mail is appended to \fI/file/name\fR. See \fBlocal\fR(8)
#	for details of delivery to file.
#	Delivery is not limited to regular files.  For example, to dispose
#	of unwanted mail, deflect it to \fB/dev/null\fR.
# .IP "|\fIcommand\fR"
#	Mail is piped into \fIcommand\fR. Commands that contain special
#	characters, such as whitespace, should be enclosed between double
#	quotes. See \fBlocal\fR(8) for details of delivery to command.
# .sp
#	When the command fails, a limited amount of command output is
#	mailed back to the sender.  The file \fB/usr/include/sysexits.h\fR
#	defines the expected exit status codes. For example, use
#	\fB|"exit 67"\fR to simulate a "user unknown" error, and
#	\fB|"exit 0"\fR to implement an expensive black hole.
# .IP \fB:include:\fI/file/name\fR
#	Mail is sent to the destinations listed in the named file.
#	Lines in \fB:include:\fR files have the same syntax
#	as the right-hand side of alias entries.
# .sp
#	A destination can be any destination that is described in this
#	manual page. However, delivery to "|\fIcommand\fR" and
#	\fI/file/name\fR is disallowed by default. To enable, edit the
#	\fBallow_mail_to_commands\fR and \fBallow_mail_to_files\fR
#	configuration parameters.
# ADDRESS EXTENSION
# .ad
# .fi
#	When alias database search fails, and the recipient localpart
#	contains the optional recipient delimiter (e.g., \fIuser+foo\fR),
#	the search is repeated for the unextended address (e.g., \fIuser\fR).
# CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
# .ad
# .fi
#	The following \fBmain.cf\fR parameters are especially relevant to
#	this topic. See the Postfix \fBmain.cf\fR file for syntax details
#	and for default values. Use the \fBpostfix reload\fR command after
#	a configuration change.
# .IP \fBalias_maps\fR
#	List of alias databases.
# .IP \fBallow_mail_to_commands\fR
#	Restrict the usage of mail delivery to external command.
# .IP \fBallow_mail_to_files\fR
#	Restrict the usage of mail delivery to external file.
# .IP \fBexpand_owner_alias\fR
#	When delivering to an alias that has an \fBowner-\fR companion alias,
#	set the envelope sender address to the right-hand side of the
#	owner alias, instead using of the left-hand side address.
# .IP \fBowner_request_special\fR
#	Give special treatment to \fBowner-\fIxxx\fR and \fIxxx\fB-request\fR
#	addresses.
# .IP \fBrecipient_delimiter\fR
#	Delimiter that separates recipients from address extensions.
