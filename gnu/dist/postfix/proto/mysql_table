# NAME
#	mysql_table 5
# SUMMARY
#	Postfix MySQL client configuration
# SYNOPSIS
#	\fBpostmap -q "\fIstring\fB" mysql:/etc/postfix/filename\fR
#
#	\fBpostmap -q - mysql:/etc/postfix/\fIfilename\fR <\fIinputfile\fR
# DESCRIPTION
#	The Postfix mail system uses optional tables for address
#	rewriting or mail routing. These tables are usually in
#	\fBdbm\fR or \fBdb\fR format.
#
#	Alternatively, lookup tables can be specified as MySQL databases.
#	In order to use MySQL lookups, define a MySQL source as a lookup
#	table in main.cf, for example:
# .ti +4
#	alias_maps = mysql:/etc/mysql-aliases.cf
#
#	The file /etc/postfix/mysql-aliases.cf has the same format as
#	the Postfix main.cf file, and can specify the parameters
#	described below.
# ALTERNATIVE CONFIGURATION
# .ad
# .fi
#	For compatibility with other Postfix lookup tables, MySQL
#	parameters can also be defined in main.cf.  In order to do that,
#	specify as MySQL source a name that doesn't begin with a slash
#	or a dot.  The MySQL parameters will then be accessible as the
#	name you've given the source in its definition, an underscore,
#	and the name of the parameter.	For example, if the map is
#	specified as "mysql:\fImysqlname\fR", the parameter "hosts"
#	below would be defined in main.cf as "\fImysqlname\fR_hosts".
#
#	Note: with this form, the passwords for the MySQL sources are
#	written in main.cf, which is normally world-readable.  Support
#	for this form will be removed in a future Postfix version.
# LIST MEMBERSHIP
# .ad
# .fi
#	When using SQL to store lists such as $mynetworks,
#	$mydestination, $relay_domains, $local_recipient_maps,
#	etc., it is important to understand that the table must
#	store each list member as a separate key. The table lookup
#	verifies the *existence* of the key. See "Postfix lists
#	versus tables" in the DATABASE_README document for a
#	discussion.
#
#	Do NOT create tables that return the full list of domains
#	in $mydestination or $relay_domains etc., or IP addresses
#	in $mynetworks.
#
#	DO create tables with each matching item as a key and with
#	an arbitrary value. With SQL databases it is not uncommon to
#	return the key itself or a constant value.
# MYSQL PARAMETERS
# .ad
# .fi
# .IP "\fBhosts\fR"
#	The hosts that Postfix will try to connect to and query from.
#	Specify \fIunix:\fR for UNIX domain sockets, \fIinet:\fR for TCP
#	connections (default).  Example:
# .ti +4
#	hosts = host1.some.domain host2.some.domain
# .ti +4
#	hosts = unix:/file/name
#
#	The hosts are tried in random order, with all connections over
#	UNIX domain sockets being tried before those over TCP.	The
#	connections are automatically closed after being idle for about
#	1 minute, and are re-opened as necessary. Postfix versions 2.0
#	and earlier do not randomize the host order.
#
#	NOTE: if you specify localhost as a hostname (even if you
#	prefix it with \fIinet:\fR), MySQL will connect to the default
#	UNIX domain socket.  In order to instruct MySQL to connect to
#	localhost over TCP you have to specify
# .ti +4
#	hosts = 127.0.0.1
# .IP "\fBuser, password\fR"
#	The user name and password to log into the mysql server.
#	Example:
# .in +4
#	user = someone
# .br
#	password = some_password
# .in -4
# .IP "\fBdbname\fR"
#	The database name on the servers. Example:
# .ti +4
#	dbname = customer_database
# .PP
#	The following parameters are used to fill in a SELECT
#	query template of the form:
# .ti +4
#	select [\fBselect_field\fR] from [\fBtable\fR] where 
# .ti +8
#	[\fBwhere_field\fR] = '$lookup' [\fBadditional_conditions\fR]
#
#	$lookup contains the search string, and is escaped so if
#	it contains single quotes or other odd characters, it will
#	not cause a parse error, or worse, a security problem.
# .IP "\fBselect_field\fR"
#	The SQL "select" parameter. Example:
# .ti +4
#	select_field = forw_addr
# .IP "\fBtable\fR"
#	The SQL "select .. from" table name. Example:
# .ti +4
#	table = mxaliases
# .IP "\fBwhere_field\fR
#	The SQL "select .. where" parameter. Example:
# .ti +4
#	where_field = alias
# .IP "\fBadditional_conditions\fR
#	Additional conditions to the SQL query. Example:
# .ti +4
#	additional_conditions = and status = 'paid'
