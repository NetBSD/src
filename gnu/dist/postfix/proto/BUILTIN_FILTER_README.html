Postfix Built-in Content Inspection</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Built-in content inspection introduction </h2>

<p> Postfix supports a built-in filter mechanism that examines
message header and message body content, one line at a time, before
it is stored in the Postfix queue. The filter is usually implemented
with POSIX or PCRE regular expressions, as described in the
header_checks(5) manual page. </p>

<p>  The original purpose of the built-in filter is to stop an
outbreak of specific email worms or viruses, and it does this job
well. The filter has also helped to block bounced junk email,
bounced email from worms or viruses, and notifications from virus
detection systems.  Information about this secondary application
is given in the BACKSCATTER_README document.  </p>

<p> Because the built-in filter is optimized for stopping specific
worms and virus outbreaks, it has <a href="#limitations">limitations</a>
that make it NOT suitable for general junk email and virus detection.
For that, you should use one of the external content inspection
methods that are described in the FILTER_README, SMTPD_PROXY_README
and MILTER_README documents.  </p>

<p> The following diagram gives an over-all picture of how Postfix
built-in content inspection works: </p>

<p> The picture makes clear that the filter works while Postfix is
receiving new mail.  This means that Postfix can reject mail from
the network without having to return undeliverable mail to the
originator address (which is often spoofed anyway). However, this
ability comes at a price:  if mail inspection takes too much time,
then the remote client will time out, and the client may send the
same message repeatedly. </p>

<h2><a name="what">What mail is subjected to header/body checks </a></h2>

<p> Postfix header/body checks are implemented by the cleanup(8)
server before it injects mail into the incoming queue.  The diagram
below zooms in on the cleanup(8) server, and shows that this server
handles mail from many different sources. In order to keep the
diagram readable, the sources of postmaster notifications are not
shown, because they can be produced by many Postfix daemon processes.

<p> For efficiency reasons, only mail that enters from outside of
Postfix is inspected with header/body checks. It would be inefficient
to filter already filtered mail again, and it would be undesirable
to block postmaster notifications.  The table below summarizes what
mail is and is not subject to header/body checks. </p>

<blockquote>

<table border="1">

<tr> <th> Message type </th> <th> Source </th> <th> Header/body checks? </th> </tr>

<tr> <td> Undeliverable mail </td> <td> bounce(8) </td> <td> No </td> </tr>

<tr> <td> Network mail </td> <td> smtpd(8) </td> <td> Configurable </td> </tr>

<tr> <td> Network mail </td> <td> qmqpd(8) </td>  <td> Configurable </td> </tr>

<tr> <td> Local submission </td> <td> pickup(8) </td>  <td> Configurable </td> </tr>

<tr> <td> Local forwarding </td> <td> local(8) </td> <td> No </td> </tr>

<tr> <td> Postmaster notice </td> <td> many </td> <td> No </td> </tr>

<p> How does Postfix decide what mail needs to be filtered? It
would be clumsy to make the decision in the cleanup(8) server, as
this program receives mail from so many different sources.  Instead,
header/body checks are requested by the source.  Examples of how
to turn off header/body checks for mail received with smtpd(8),
qmqpd(8) or pickup(8) are given below under "<a
href="#remote_only">Configuring header/body checks for mail from
outside users only</a>" and "<a href="#domain_except">Configuring
header/body checks for mail to some domains only</a>".  </p>

<h2><a name="limitations">Limitations of Postfix header/body checks </a></h2>

<ul> 

<li> <p> Header/body checks do not decode message headers or message
body content. For example, if text in the message body is BASE64
encoded (RFC 2045) then your regular expressions will have to match
the BASE64 encoded form. Likewise, message headers with encoded
non-ASCII characters (RFC 2047) need to be matched in their encoded
form. </p>

<li> <p> Header/body checks cannot filter on a combination of
message headers or body lines. Header/body checks examine content
one message header at a time, or one message body line at a time,
and cannot carry a decision over to the next message header or body
line.  </p>

<li> <p> Header/body checks cannot depend on the recipient of a
message.  </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> One message can have multiple recipients, and all recipients
of a message receive the same treatment. Workarounds have been
proposed that involve selectively deferring some recipients of
multi-recipient mail, but that results in poor SMTP performance
and does not work for non-SMTP mail.  </p>

<li> <p> Some sources of mail send the headers and content ahead
of the recipient information. It would be inefficient to buffer up
an entire message before deciding if it needs to be filtered, and
it would be clumsy to filter mail and to buffer up all the actions
until it is known whether those actions need to be executed.  </p>

</ul>

<li> <p> Despite warnings, some people try to use the built-in
filter feature for general junk email and/or virus blocking, using
hundreds or even thousands of regular expressions. This can result
in catastrophic performance failure. The symptoms are as follows:
</p>

<ul>

<li> <p> The cleanup(8) processes use up all available CPU time in
order to process the regular expressions, and/or they use up all
available memory so that the system begins to swap. This slows down
all incoming mail deliveries.  </p>

<li> <p> As Postfix needs more and more time to receive an email
message, the number of simultaneous SMTP sessions increases to the
point that the SMTP server process limit is reached. </p>

<li> <p> While all SMTP server processes are waiting for the
cleanup(8) servers to finish, new SMTP clients have to wait until
an SMTP server process becomes available. This causes mail deliveries
to time out before they have even begun.  </p>

</ul>

<p> The remedy for this type of performance problem is simple:
don't use header/body checks for general junk email and/or virus
blocking, and don't filter mail before it is queued.  When performance
is a concern, use an external content filter that runs after mail
is queued, as described in the FILTER_README document. </p>

</ul>

<h2><a name="daily">Preventing daily mail status reports from being blocked </a></h2>

<p>The following is quoted from Jim Seymour's Pflogsumm FAQ at
http://jimsun.linxnet.com/downloads/pflogsumm-faq.txt. Pflogsumm
is a program that analyzes Postfix logs, including the logging from
rejected mail. If these logs contain text that was rejected by
Postfix body_checks patterns, then the logging is also likely to
be rejected by those same body_checks patterns. This problem does
not exist with header_checks patterns, because those are not applied
to the text that is part of the mail status report. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>You configure Postfix to do body checks, Postfix does its thing,
Pflogsumm reports it and Postfix catches the same string in the
Pflogsumm report.  There are several solutions to this. </p>

<p> Wolfgang Zeikat contributed this: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use MIME::Lite;

### Create a new message:
$msg = MIME::Lite-&gt;new(
    From     =&gt; 'your@send.er',
    To       =&gt; 'your@recipie.nt',
    # Cc     =&gt; 'some@other.com, some@more.com',
    Subject  =&gt; 'pflogsumm',
    Date     =&gt; `date`,
    Type     =&gt; 'text/plain',
    Encoding =&gt; 'base64',
    Path     =&gt; '/tmp/pflogg',
);

$msg-&gt;send;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> Where "/tmp/pflogg" is the output of Pflogsumm.  This puts Pflogsumm's
output in a base64 MIME attachment. </p>

</blockquote>

<p> Note by Wietse: if you run this on a machine that is accessible
by untrusted users, it is safer to store the Pflogsumm report in
a directory that is not world writable. </p>

<blockquote>

<p> In a follow-up to a thread in the postfix-users mailing list, Ralf
Hildebrandt noted: </p>

<blockquote> <p> "mpack does the same thing." </p> </blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p> And it does. Which tool one should use is a matter of preference.
</p>

<p> Other solutions involve additional body_checks rules that make
exceptions for daily mail status reports, but this is not recommended.
Such rules slow down all mail and complicate Postfix maintenance.

<h2><a name="remote_only">Configuring header/body checks for mail from outside users only</a></h2>

<p> The following information applies to Postfix 2.1. Earlier

</p>

<p> The easiest approach is to configure ONE Postfix instance with
multiple SMTP server IP addresses in master.cf: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Two SMTP server IP addresses for mail from inside users
only, with header/body filtering turned off, and a local mail pickup
service with header/body filtering turned off.  </p>

    1.2.3.5:smtp  inet  n       -       n       -       -       smtpd
</pre>

</ul>

<h2><a name="domain_except">Configuring header/body checks for mail to some domains only</a></h2>

<p> The following information applies to Postfix 2.1. Earlier
Postfix versions do not support the receive_override_options feature.
</p>

<p> If you are MX service provider and want to apply disable
head/body checks for some domains, you can configure ONE Postfix
instance with multiple SMTP server IP addresses in master.cf. Each
address provides a different service. </p>

<blockquote>

<pre>

    # SMTP service for domains with header/body checks turned on.
    1.2.3.4:smtp  inet  n       -       n       -       -       smtpd

<p> Once this is set up you can configure MX records in the DNS
that route each domain to the proper SMTP server instance. </p>
