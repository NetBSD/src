# NAME
#	access 5
# SUMMARY
#	format of Postfix access table
# SYNOPSIS
#	\fBpostmap /etc/postfix/access\fR
# DESCRIPTION
#	The optional \fBaccess\fR table directs the Postfix SMTP server
#	to selectively reject or accept mail from or to specific hosts,
#	domains, networks, host addresses or mail addresses.
#
#	Normally, the \fBaccess\fR table is specified as a text file
#	that serves as input to the \fBpostmap\fR(1) command.
#	The result, an indexed file in \fBdbm\fR or \fBdb\fR format,
#	is used for fast searching by the mail system. Execute the command
#	\fBpostmap /etc/postfix/access\fR in order to rebuild the indexed
#	file after changing the access table.
#
#	When the table is provided via other means such as NIS, LDAP
#	or SQL, the same lookups are done as for ordinary indexed files.
#
#	Alternatively, the table can be provided as a regular-expression
#	map where patterns are given as regular expressions. In that case,
#	the lookups are done in a slightly different way as described below.
# TABLE FORMAT
# .ad
# .fi
#	The format of the access table is as follows:
# .IP "blanks and comments"
#	Blank lines are ignored, as are lines beginning with `#'.
# .IP "leading whitespace"
#	Lines that begin with whitespace continue the previous line.
# .IP "\fIpattern action\fR"
#	When \fIpattern\fR matches a mail address, domain or host address,
#	perform the corresponding \fIaction\fR.
# PATTERNS
# .ad
# .fi
#	With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from networked
#	tables such as NIS, LDAP or SQL, patterns are tried in the order as
#	listed below:
# .IP \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR
#	Matches the specified mail address.
# .IP \fIdomain.name\fR
#	Matches the \fIdomain.name\fR itself and any subdomain thereof,
#	either in hostnames or in mail addresses. Top-level domains will
#	never be matched.
# .IP \fIuser\fR@
#	Matches all mail addresses with the specified user part.
# .IP \fInet.work.addr.ess\fR
# .IP \fInet.work.addr\fR
# .IP \fInet.work\fR
# .IP \fInet\fR
#	Matches any host address in the specified network. A network
#	address is a sequence of one or more octets separated by ".".
# ACTIONS
# .ad
# .fi
# .IP "[\fB45\fR]\fIXX text\fR"
#	Reject the address etc. that matches the pattern, and respond with
#	the numerical code and text.
# .IP \fBREJECT\fR
#	Reject the address etc. that matches the pattern. A generic
#	error response message is generated.
# .IP \fBOK\fR
#	Accept the address etc. that matches the pattern.
# .IP \fIrestriction...\fR
#	Apply the named UCE restriction (\fBpermit\fR, \fRreject\fR,
#	\fBreject_unauth_destination\fR, and so on).
# REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES
# .ad
# .fi
#	This section describes how the table lookups change when the table
#	is given in the form of regular expressions. For a description of
#	regular expression lookup table syntax, see \fBregexp_table\fR(5)
#	or \fBpcre_table\fR(5).
#
#	Each pattern is a regular expression that is applied to the entire
#	string being looked up. Depending on the application, that string
#	is an entire client hostname, an entire client IP address, or an
#	entire mail address. Thus, no parent domain or parent network search
#	is done, and \fIuser@domain\fR mail addresses are not broken up into
#	their \fIuser@\fR and \fIdomain\fR constituent parts.
#
#	Patterns are applied in the order as specified in the table, until a
#	pattern is found that matches the search string.
#
#	Actions are the same as with normal indexed file lookups, with
#	the additional feature that parenthesized substrings from the
#	pattern can be interpolated as \fB$1\fR, \fB$2\fR and so on.
# BUGS
#	The table format does not understand quoting conventions.
