# NAME
#	regexp_table 5
# SUMMARY
#	format of Postfix regular expression tables
# SYNOPSIS
#	regexp:/etc/postfix/filename
# DESCRIPTION
#	The Postfix mail system uses optional tables for address
#	rewriting or mail routing. These tables are usually in
#	\fBdbm\fR or \fBdb\fR format. Alternatively, lookup tables
#	can be specified in POSIX regular expression form.
#
#	To find out what types of lookup tables your Postfix system
#	supports use the \fBpostconf -m\fR command.
#
#	The general form of a Postfix regular expression table is:
# .IP "blanks and comments"
#	Blank lines are ignored, as are lines beginning with `#'.
# .IP "leading whitespace"
#	Lines that begin with whitespace continue the previous line.
# .IP "\fIpattern result\fR"
#	When \fIpattern\fR matches a search string, use the corresponding
#	\fIresult\fR. A line that starts with white space continues the
#	preceding line.
# .IP "\fIpattern1!pattern2 result\fR"
#	Matches \fIpattern1\fR but not \fIpattern2\fR.
# .PP
#	Each pattern is a regular expression enclosed by a pair of delimiters.
#	The regular expression syntax is described in \fIre_format\fR(7).
#	The expression delimiter can be any character, except whitespace
#	or characters that have special meaning (traditionally the forward
#	slash is used). The regular expression can contain whitespace.
#
#	By default, matching is case-insensitive, although following
#	the second slash with an `i' flag will reverse this. Other flags
#	are `x' (disable extended expression syntax), and `m' (enable
#	multi-line mode).
#
#	Each pattern is applied to the entire string being looked up.
#	Depending on the application, that string is an entire client
#	hostname, an entire client IP address, or an entire mail address.
#	Thus, no parent domain or parent network search is done, and
#	\fIuser@domain\fR mail addresses are not broken up into their
#	\fIuser\fR and \fIdomain\fR constituent parts, nor is \fIuser+foo\fR
#	broken up into \fIuser\fR and \fIfoo\fR.
#
#	Patterns are applied in the order as specified in the table, until a
#	pattern is found that matches the search string.
#
#	Substitution of sub-strings from the matched expression is
#	possible using $1, $2, etc.. The macros in the replacement string
#	may need to be written as ${n} or $(n) if they aren't followed
#	by whitespace.
# EXAMPLES
#	# Disallow sender-specified routing. This is a must if you relay mail
#	# for other domains.
#	/[%!@].*[%!@]/            550 Sender-specified routing rejected
#
#	# Postmaster is OK, that way they can talk to us about how to fix
#	# their problem.
#	/^postmaster@.*$/         OK
#
#	# Protect your outgoing majordomo exploders
#	/^(.*)-outgoing@(.*)$/!/^owner-.*/      550 Use ${1}@${2} instead
