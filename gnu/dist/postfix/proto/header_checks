# DESCRIPTION
#	Postfix provides a simple built-in content inspection mechanism that
#	examines incoming mail one message header or one message body line
#	at a time. Each input is compared against a list of patterns, and
#	when a match is found the corresponding action is executed.
#	This feature is implemented by the Postfix \fBcleanup\fR(8) server.
#
#	For examples, see the EXAMPLES section at the end of this
#	manual page.
#
#	Postfix header or body_checks are designed to stop a flood of mail
#	from worms or viruses; they do not decode attachments, and they do
#	not unzip archives. See the documents referenced below in the README
#	FILES section if you need more sophisticated content analysis.
#
#	Postfix supports four built-in content inspection classes:
# .IP \fBheader_checks\fR
#	These are applied to initial message headers (except for
#	the headers that are processed with \fBmime_header_checks\fR).
# .IP "\fBmime_header_checks\fR (default: \fB$header_checks\fR)"
#	These are applied to MIME related message headers only.
# .sp
#	This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.
# .IP "\fBnested_header_checks\fR (default: \fB$header_checks\fR)"
#	These are applied to message headers of attached email
#	messages (except for the headers that are processed with
#	\fBmime_header_checks\fR).
# .sp
#	This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.
# .IP \fBbody_checks\fR
#	These are applied to all other content, including multi-part
#	message boundaries.
# .sp
#	With Postfix versions before 2.0, all content after the initial
#	message headers is treated as body content.
# .PP
#	Note: message headers are examined one logical header at a time,
#	even when a message header spans multiple lines. Body lines are
#	always examined one line at a time.
# TABLE FORMAT
# .ad
# .fi
#	This document assumes that header and body_checks rules are specified
#	in the form of Postfix regular expression lookup tables. Usually the
#	best performance is obtained with \fBpcre\fR (Perl Compatible Regular
#	Expression) tables, but the slower \fBregexp\fR (POSIX regular
#	expressions) support is more widely available.
#	Use the command \fBpostconf -m\fR to find out what lookup table
#	types your Postfix system supports.
#
#	The general format of Postfix regular expression tables is
#	given below.
#	For a discussion of specific pattern or flags syntax,
#	see \fBpcre_table\fR(5) or \fBregexp_table\fR(5), respectively.
# .IP "\fB/\fIpattern\fB/\fIflags action\fR"
#	When \fIpattern\fR matches the input string, execute
#	the corresponding \fIaction\fR. See below for a list
#	of possible actions.
# .IP "\fB!/\fIpattern\fB/\fIflags action\fR"
#	When \fIpattern\fR does \fBnot\fR match the input string,
#	execute the corresponding \fIaction\fR.
# .IP "\fBif /\fIpattern\fB/\fIflags\fR"
# .IP "\fBendif\fR"
#	Match the input string against the patterns between \fBif\fR
#	and \fBendif\fR, if and only if the input string also matches
#	\fIpattern\fR. The \fBif\fR..\fBendif\fR can nest.
# .sp
#	Note: do not prepend whitespace to patterns inside
#	\fBif\fR..\fBendif\fR.
# .IP "\fBif !/\fIpattern\fB/\fIflags\fR"
# .IP "\fBendif\fR"
#	Match the input string against the patterns between \fBif\fR
#	and \fBendif\fR, if and only if the input string does \fBnot\fR
#	match \fIpattern\fR. The \fBif\fR..\fBendif\fR can nest.
# .IP "blank lines and comments"
#	Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored, as
#	are lines whose first non-whitespace character is a `#'.
# .IP "multi-line text"
#	A pattern/action line starts with non-whitespace text. A line that
#	starts with whitespace continues a logical line.
# TABLE SEARCH ORDER
# .ad
# .fi
#	For each line of message input, the patterns are applied in the
#	order as specified in the table. When a pattern is found that matches
#	the input line, the corresponding action is executed and then the
#	next input line is inspected.
# TEXT SUBSTITUTION
# .ad
# .fi
#	Substitution of substrings from the matched expression into the
#	\fIaction\fR
#	string is possible using the conventional Perl syntax ($1, $2, etc.).
#	The macros in the result string may need to be written as ${n}
#	or $(n) if they aren't followed by whitespace.
#
#	Note: since negated patterns (those preceded by \fB!\fR) return a
#	result when the expression does not match, substitutions are not
#	available for negated patterns.
# ACTIONS
# .ad
# .fi
#	Action names are case insensitive. They are shown in upper case
#	for consistency with other Postfix documentation.
# .IP "\fBDISCARD \fIoptional text...\fR"
#	Claim successful delivery and silently discard the message.
#	Log the optional text if specified, otherwise log a generic
#	message.
# .sp
#	Note: this action disables further header or body_checks inspection
#	of the current message and affects all recipients.
# .sp
#	This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.
# .IP \fBDUNNO\fR
#	Pretend that the input line did not match any pattern, and inspect the
#	next input line. This action can be used to shorten the table search.
# .sp
#	For backwards compatibility reasons, Postfix also accepts
#	\fBOK\fR but it is (and always has been) treated as \fBDUNNO\fR.
# .sp
#	This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.
# .IP "\fBFILTER \fItransport:destination\fR"
#	Write a content filter request to the queue file and
#	inspect the next input line.
#	After the complete message is received it will be sent through
#	the specified external content filter.  More information about
#	external content filters is in the Postfix FILTER_README file.
# .sp
#	Note: this action overrides the \fBmain.cf content_filter\fR setting,
#	and affects all recipients of the message. In the case that multiple
#	\fBFILTER\fR actions fire, only the last one is executed.
# .sp
#	This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.
# .IP "\fBHOLD \fIoptional text...\fR"
#	Arrange for the message to be placed on the \fBhold\fR queue,
#	and inspect the next input line.  The message remains on \fBhold\fR
#	until someone either deletes it or releases it for delivery.
#	Log the optional text if specified, otherwise log a generic
#	message.
#
#	Mail that is placed on hold can be examined with the
#	\fBpostcat\fR(1) command, and can be destroyed or released with
#	the \fBpostsuper\fR(1) command.
# .sp
#	Note: this action affects all recipients of the message.
# .sp
#	This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.
# .IP \fBIGNORE\fR
#	Delete the current line from the input and inspect
#	the next input line.
# .IP "\fBPREPEND \fItext...\fR"
#	Prepend one line with the specified text and inspect the next
#	input line.
# .sp
#	Note: the prepended text is output immediately before the
#	input that triggered the \fBPREPEND\fR action. A body action
#	cannot prepend a message header.
# .sp
#	Note: this action cannot be used to prepend multi-line text.
# .sp
#	This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.
# .IP "\fBREDIRECT \fIuser@domain\fR"
#	Write a message redirection request to the queue file and
#	inspect the next input line. After the message is queued,
#	it will be sent to the specified address instead of the
#	intended recipient(s).
# .sp
#	Note: this action overrides the \fBFILTER\fR action, and affects
#	all recipients of the message. If multiple \fBREDIRECT\fR actions
#	fire, only the last one is executed.
# .sp
#	This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.
# .IP "\fBREJECT \fIoptional text...\fR
#	Reject the entire message. Reply with \fIoptional text...\fR when
#	the optional text is specified, otherwise reply with a generic error
#	message.
# .sp
#	Note: this action disables further header or body_checks inspection
#	of the current message and affects all recipients.
# .IP "\fBWARN \fIoptional text...\fR
#	Log a warning with the \fIoptional text...\fR (or log a
#	generic message) and inspect the next input line. This
#	action is useful for debugging and for testing a pattern
#	before applying more drastic actions.
# BUGS
#	Many people overlook the main limitations of header and body_checks
#	rules.  These rules operate on one logical message header or one body
#	line at a time, and a decision made for one line is not carried over
#	to the next line.  If text in the message body is encoded
#	(RFC 2045) then the rules have to specified for the encoded
#	form.  Likewise, when message headers are encoded (RFC
#	2047) then the rules need to be specified for the encoded
#	form.
#
#	Message headers added by the \fBcleanup\fR(8) daemon itself
#	are excluded from inspection. Examples of such message headers
#	are \fBFrom:\fR, \fBTo:\fR, \fBMessage-ID:\fR, \fBDate:\fR.
#
#	Message headers deleted by the \fBcleanup\fR(8) daemon will
#	be examined before they are deleted. Examples are: \fBBcc:\fr,
#	\fBContent-Length:\fR, \fBReturn-Path:\fR.
# CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
# .ad
# .fi
# .IP \fBbody_checks\fR
#	Lookup tables with content filter rules for message body lines.
#	These filters see one physical line at a time, in chunks of
#	at most \fB$line_length_limit\fR bytes.
# .IP \fBbody_checks_size_limit\fP
#	The amount of content per message body segment (attachment) that is
#	subjected to \fB$body_checks\fR filtering.
# .IP \fBheader_checks\fR
# .IP "\fBmime_header_checks\fR (default: \fB$header_checks\fR)"
# .IP "\fBnested_header_checks\fR (default: \fB$header_checks\fR)"
#	Lookup tables with content filter rules for message header lines:
#	respectively, these are applied to the initial message headers
#	(not including MIME headers), to the MIME headers anywhere in
#	the message, and to the initial headers of attached messages.
# .sp
#	Note: these filters see one logical message header at a time, even
#	when a message header spans multiple lines. Message headers that
#	are longer than \fB$header_size_limit\fR characters are truncated.
# .IP \fBdisable_mime_input_processing\fR
#	While receiving mail, give no special treatment to MIME related
#	message headers; all text after the initial message headers is
#	considered to be part of the message body. This means that
#	\fBheader_checks\fR is applied to all the initial message headers,
#	and that \fBbody_checks\fR is applied to the remainder of the
#	message.
# .sp
#	Note: when used in this manner, \fBbody_checks\fR will process
#	a multi-line message header one line at a time.
