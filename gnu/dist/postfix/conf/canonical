# CANONICAL(5)                                         CANONICAL(5)
# 
# NAME
#        canonical - format of Postfix canonical table
# 
# SYNOPSIS
#        postmap /etc/postfix/canonical
# 
# DESCRIPTION
#        The  optional canonical table specifies an address mapping
#        for local and non-local addresses. The mapping is used  by
#        the  cleanup(8) daemon.  The address mapping is recursive.
# 
#        Normally, the canonical table is specified as a text  file
#        that  serves  as  input  to  the  postmap(1) command.  The
#        result, an indexed file in dbm or db format, is  used  for
#        fast  searching  by  the  mail system. Execute the command
#        postmap /etc/postfix/canonical in  order  to  rebuild  the
#        indexed file after changing the text file.
# 
#        When  the  table  is provided via other means such as NIS,
#        LDAP or SQL, the same lookups are  done  as  for  ordinary
#        indexed files.
# 
#        Alternatively,  the  table  can  be provided as a regular-
#        expression map where patterns are given as regular expres-
#        sions.  In  that  case, the lookups are done in a slightly
#        different way as described below.
# 
#        The  canonical  mapping  affects   both   message   header
#        addresses (i.e. addresses that appear inside messages) and
#        message envelope addresses  (for  example,  the  addresses
#        that  are  used in SMTP protocol commands). Think Sendmail
#        rule set S3, if you like.
# 
#        Typically, one would use the canonical  table  to  replace
#        login   names   by  Firstname.Lastname,  or  to  clean  up
#        addresses produced by legacy mail systems.
# 
#        The canonical mapping is not to be confused  with  virtual
#        domain support. Use the virtual(5) map for that purpose.
# 
#        The  canonical  mapping  is  not to be confused with local
#        aliasing.  Use the aliases(5) map for that purpose.
# 
# TABLE FORMAT
#        The format of the canonical table is as follows:
# 
#        pattern result
#               When pattern matches a mail address, replace it  by
#               the corresponding result.
# 
#        blank lines and comments
#               Empty  lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored,
#               as are lines whose first  non-whitespace  character
#               is a `#'.
# 
#        multi-line text
#               A  logical  line starts with non-whitespace text. A
#               line that starts with whitespace continues a  logi-
#               cal line.
# 
#        With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from
#        networked tables such as NIS, LDAP or  SQL,  patterns  are
#        tried in the order as listed below:
# 
#        user@domain address
#               user@domain  is  replaced by address. This form has
#               the highest precedence.
# 
#               This form useful to clean up addresses produced  by
#               legacy  mail  systems.  It can also be used to pro-
#               duce Firstname.Lastname style  addresses,  but  see
#               below for a simpler solution.
# 
#        user address
#               user@site is replaced by address when site is equal
#               to $myorigin, when site is  listed  in  $mydestina-
#               tion, or when it is listed in $inet_interfaces.
# 
#               This  form  is  useful for replacing login names by
#               Firstname.Lastname.
# 
#        @domain address
#               Every address in domain  is  replaced  by  address.
#               This form has the lowest precedence.
# 
#        In  all the above forms, when address has the form @other-
#        domain, the result is the same user in otherdomain.
# 
# ADDRESS EXTENSION
#        When a mail address localpart contains the optional recip-
#        ient  delimiter  (e.g., user+foo@domain), the lookup order
#        becomes: user+foo@domain, user@domain, user+foo, user, and
#        @domain.   An unmatched address extension (+foo) is propa-
#        gated to the result of table lookup.
# 
# REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES
#        This section describes how the table lookups  change  when
#        the table is given in the form of regular expressions. For
#        a description of regular expression lookup  table  syntax,
#        see regexp_table(5) or pcre_table(5).
# 
#        Each  pattern  is  a regular expression that is applied to
#        the entire address being looked up. Thus, user@domain mail
#        addresses  are  not  broken up into their user and @domain
#        constituent parts, nor is user+foo broken up into user and
#        foo.
# 
#        Patterns  are  applied  in  the  order as specified in the
#        table, until a pattern is found that  matches  the  search
#        string.
# 
#        Results  are  the  same as with indexed file lookups, with
#        the additional feature that parenthesized substrings  from
#        the pattern can be interpolated as $1, $2 and so on.
# 
# BUGS
#        The  table format does not understand quoting conventions.
