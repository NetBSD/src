# NAME
#	post-install
# SUMMARY
#	Postfix post-installation script
# SYNOPSIS
#	post-install [name=value] command ...
# DESCRIPTION
#	The post-install script performs the finishing touch of a Postfix
#	installation, after the executable programs and configuration
#	files are installed. Usage is one of the following:
# .IP o
#	While installing Postfix from source code on the local machine, the
#	script is run by the postfix-install script to update selected file
#	or directory permissions and to update Postfix configuration files.
# .IP o
#	While installing Postfix from a pre-built package, the script is run
#	by the package management procedure to set all file or directory
#	permissions and to update Postfix configuration files.
# .IP o
#	The script can be used to change installation parameter settings such
#	as mail_owner or setgid_group after Postfix is already installed.
# .IP o
#	The script can be used to upgrade configuration files and to upgrade
#	file/directory permissions of a secondary Postfix instance.
# .IP o
#	At Postfix start-up time, the script is run from "postfix check" to
#	create missing queue directories.
# .PP
#	The post-install script is controlled by installation parameters.
#	Specific parameters are described at the end of this document.
#	All installation parameters must be specified ahead of time via
#	one of the methods described below.
#
#	Arguments
# .IP create-missing
#	Create missing queue directories with ownerships and permissions
#	according to the contents of $config_directory/postfix-files, using
#	the mail_owner and setgid_group parameter settings from the command
#	line, process environment or from the installed main.cf file.
#
#	This is required at Postfix start-up time.
# .IP set-permissions
#	Set all file/directory ownerships and permissions according to the
#	contents of $config_directory/postfix-files, using the mail_owner
#	and setgid_group parameter settings from the command line, process
#	environment or from the installed main.cf file. Implies create-missing.
#
#	This is required when installing Postfix from a pre-built package,
#	or when changing the mail_owner or setgid_group installation parameter
#	settings after Postfix is already installed.
# .IP upgrade-permissions
#	Update ownership and permission of existing files/directories as
#	specified in $config_directory/postfix-files, using the mail_owner
#	and setgid_group parameter settings from the command line, process
#	environment or from the installed main.cf file. Implies create-missing.
#
#	This is required when upgrading an existing Postfix instance.
# .IP upgrade-configuration
#	Edit the installed main.cf and master.cf files, in order to account
#	for missing services and to fix deprecated parameter settings.
#
#	This is required when upgrading an existing Postfix instance.
# .IP upgrade-source
#	Short-hand for: upgrade-permissions upgrade-configuration.
#
#	This is recommended when upgrading Postfix from source code.
# .IP upgrade-package
#	Short-hand for: set-permissions upgrade-configuration.
#
#	This is recommended when upgrading Postfix from a pre-built package.
# .IP first-install-reminder
#	Remind the user that they still need to configure main.cf and the
#	aliases file, and that newaliases still needs to be run.
#
#	This is recommended when Postfix is installed for the first time.
# MULTIPLE POSTFIX INSTANCES
# .ad
# .fi
#	Multiple Postfix instances on the same machine can share command and
#	daemon program files but must have separate configuration and queue
#	directories.
#
#	To create a secondary Postfix installation on the same machine,
#	copy the configuration files from the primary Postfix instance to
#	a secondary configuration directory and execute:
#
#	post-install config_directory=secondary-config-directory \e
# .in +4
#		queue_directory=secondary-queue-directory \e
# .br
#		create-missing
# .PP
#	This creates secondary Postfix queue directories, sets their access
#	permissions, and saves the specified installation parameters to the
#	secondary main.cf file.
#
#	Be sure to list the secondary configuration directory in the
#	alternate_config_directories parameter in the primary main.cf file.
#
#	To upgrade a secondary Postfix installation on the same machine,
#	execute:
#
#	post-install config_directory=secondary-config-directory \e
# .in +4
#		upgrade-permissions upgrade-configuration
# INSTALLATION PARAMETER INPUT METHODS
# .ad
# .fi
#	Parameter settings can be specified through a variety of
#	mechanisms.  In order of decreasing precedence these are:
# .IP "command line"
#	Parameter settings can be given as name=value arguments on
#	the post-install command line. These have the highest precedence.
#	Settings that override the installed main.cf file are saved.
# .IP "process environment"
#	Parameter settings can be given as name=value environment
#	variables.
#	Settings that override the installed main.cf file are saved.
# .IP "installed configuration files"
#	If a parameter is not specified via the command line or via the
#	process environment, post-install will attempt to extract its
#	value from the already installed Postfix main.cf configuration file.
#	These settings have the lowest precedence.
# INSTALLATION PARAMETER DESCRIPTION
# .ad
# .fi
#	The description of installation parameters is as follows:
# .IP config_directory
#	The directory for Postfix configuration files.
# .IP daemon_directory
#	The directory for Postfix daemon programs. This directory
#	should not be in the command search path of any users.
# .IP command_directory
#	The directory for Postfix administrative commands. This
#	directory should be in the command search path of adminstrative users.
# .IP queue_directory
#	The directory for Postfix queues.
# .IP sendmail_path
#	The full pathname for the Postfix sendmail command.
#	This is the Sendmail-compatible mail posting interface.
# .IP newaliases_path
#	The full pathname for the Postfix newaliases command.
#	This is the Sendmail-compatible command to build alias databases
#	for the Postfix local delivery agent.
# .IP mailq_path
#	The full pathname for the Postfix mailq command.
#	This is the Sendmail-compatible command to list the mail queue.
# .IP mail_owner
#	The owner of the Postfix queue. Its numerical user ID and group ID
#	must not be used by any other accounts on the system.
# .IP setgid_group
#	The group for mail submission and for queue management commands.
#	Its numerical group ID must not be used by any other accounts on the
#	system, not even by the mail_owner account.
# .IP manpage_directory
#	The directory for the Postfix on-line manual pages.
# .IP sample_directory
#	The directory for the Postfix sample configuration files.
# .IP readme_directory
#	The directory for the Postfix README files.
