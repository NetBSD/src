# ALIASES(5)                                             ALIASES(5)
# 
# NAME
#        aliases - format of the Postfix alias database
# 
# SYNOPSIS
#        newaliases
# 
# DESCRIPTION
#        The  aliases  table  provides  a  system-wide mechanism to
#        redirect mail for local recipients. The  redirections  are
#        processed by the Postfix local(8) delivery agent.
# 
#        Normally,  the  aliases  table is specified as a text file
#        that serves as input  to  the  postalias(1)  command.  The
#        result,  an  indexed file in dbm or db format, is used for
#        fast lookup  by  the  mail  system.  Execute  the  command
#        newaliases  in  order  to  rebuild  the indexed file after
#        changing the Postfix alias database.
# 
#        The input and output file formats are expected to be  com-
#        patible  with  Sendmail  version 8, and are expected to be
#        suitable for the use as NIS maps.
# 
#        Users can control delivery of their own mail by setting up
#        .forward files in their home directory.  Lines in per-user
#        .forward files have the same syntax as the right-hand side
#        of aliases entries.
# 
#        The format of the alias database input file is as follows:
# 
#        o      An alias definition has the form
# 
#                    name: value1, value2, ...
# 
#        o      Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are  ignored,
#               as  are  lines whose first non-whitespace character
#               is a `#'.
# 
#        o      A logical line starts with non-whitespace  text.  A
#               line  that starts with whitespace continues a logi-
#               cal line.
# 
#        The name is a local address (no domain part).  Use  double
#        quotes  when the name contains any special characters such
#        as whitespace, `#', `:', or `@'. The  name  is  folded  to
#        lowercase, in order to make database lookups case insensi-
#        tive.
# 
#        In addition, when an alias exists for owner-name, delivery
#        diagnostics  are  directed  to that address, instead of to
#        the originator.  This is typically used to direct delivery
#        errors  to the owner of a mailing list, who is in a better
#        position to deal with mailing list delivery problems  than
#        the originator of the undelivered mail.
# 
#        The value contains one or more of the following:
# 
#        address
#               Mail  is  forwarded to address, which is compatible
#               with the RFC 822 standard.
# 
#        /file/name
#               Mail is appended to /file/name.  See  local(8)  for
#               details  of delivery to file.  Delivery is not lim-
#               ited to regular files.  For example, to dispose  of
#               unwanted mail, deflect it to /dev/null.
# 
#        |command
#               Mail  is  piped into command. Commands that contain
#               special characters, such as whitespace,  should  be
#               enclosed  between  double  quotes. See local(8) for
#               details of delivery to command.
# 
#               When the command fails, a limited amount of command
#               output  is  mailed  back  to  the sender.  The file
#               /usr/include/sysexits.h defines the  expected  exit
#               status  codes. For example, use |"exit 67" to simu-
#               late a "user  unknown"  error,  and  |"exit  0"  to
#               implement an expensive black hole.
# 
#        :include:/file/name
#               Mail  is  sent  to  the  destinations listed in the
#               named file.  Lines in :include: files have the same
#               syntax as the right-hand side of alias entries.
# 
#               A  destination  can  be  any  destination  that  is
#               described in this manual page. However, delivery to
#               "|command" and /file/name is disallowed by default.
#               To  enable,  edit  the  allow_mail_to_commands  and
#               allow_mail_to_files configuration parameters.
# 
# ADDRESS EXTENSION
#        When alias database search fails, and the recipient local-
#        part contains  the  optional  recipient  delimiter  (e.g.,
#        user+foo),  the  search  is  repeated  for  the unextended
#        address (e.g., user).
# 
# CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
#        The following main.cf parameters are especially  relevant.
#        The  text  below  provides  only  a parameter summary. See
#        postconf(5) for more details including examples.
# 
#        alias_database
#               List of alias databases that  are  updated  by  the
#               newaliases(1) command.
# 
#        alias_maps
#               List  of  alias  databases  queried by the local(8)
#               delivery agent.
# 
#        allow_mail_to_commands
#               Restrict the usage of  mail  delivery  to  external
#               command.
# 
#        allow_mail_to_files
#               Restrict  the  usage  of  mail delivery to external
#               file.
# 
#        expand_owner_alias
#               When delivering to an alias that has an owner- com-
#               panion  alias,  set  the envelope sender address to
#               the right-hand side of  the  owner  alias,  instead
#               using of the left-hand side address.
# 
#        owner_request_special
#               Give  special treatment to owner-listname and list-
#               name-request addresses.
# 
#        recipient_delimiter
#               Delimiter that separates  recipients  from  address
#               extensions.
# 
# BUGS
#        Regular  expression  alias  lookup tables are allowed, but
#        substitution of $1 etc. is forbidden  because  that  would
#        open a security loophole.
