IPv4 mapped address is not supported.

TODO:
- make it possible to run the following configuration on IPv4-only, and
  IPv4/v6 dual stack node.
	inet_interfaces = localhost
  at this moment, during initialization, localhost will be expanded into
  INET_ADDR_LIST, then we go through them in socket/bind/listen loop.
  therefore, if we fail to socket(2) it will be considered a fatal error.
  instead, we need to manage addresses by string (as is), and then
  go through it by using getaddrinfo.  socket(2) should not be considered
  a fatal error.

  at this moment, we simply filter out address that is not supported by the
  kernel.  this leads to wrong behavior in some cases.
- use sockaddr everywhere, not just 4/16byte address (util/inet_addr_host.c).
