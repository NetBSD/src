Postfix error mail delivery agent
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.na
.nf
\fBerror\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The Postfix error delivery agent processes delivery requests from
the queue manager. Each request specifies a queue file, a sender
address, a domain or host name that is treated as the reason for
non-delivery, and recipient information.
This program expects to be run from the \fBmaster\fR(8) process
manager.

The error delivery agent bounces all recipients in the delivery
request using the "next-hop"
domain or host information as the reason for non-delivery, updates
the queue file and marks recipients as finished or informs the
queue manager that delivery should be tried again at a later time.

Delivery status reports are sent to the \fBbounce\fR(8),
\fBdefer\fR(8) or \fBtrace\fR(8) daemon as appropriate.
.SH "SECURITY"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The error mailer is not security-sensitive. It does not talk
to the network, and can be run chrooted at fixed low privilege.
.SH "STANDARDS"
.na
.nf
None.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems and transactions are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8).

Depending on the setting of the \fBnotify_classes\fR parameter,
the postmaster is notified of bounces and of other trouble.
.SH "CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
