.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.na
.nf
\fBcleanup\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBcleanup\fR daemon processes inbound mail, inserts it
into the \fBincoming\fR mail queue, and informs the queue
manager of its arrival.

The \fBcleanup\fR daemon always performs the following transformations:
.IP \(bu
Insert missing message headers: (\fBResent-\fR) \fBFrom:\fR,
\fBTo:\fR, \fBMessage-Id:\fR, and \fBDate:\fR.
.IP \(bu
Transform envelope and header addresses to the standard
\fIuser@fully-qualified-domain\fR form that is expected by other
Postfix programs.
This task is delegated to the \fBtrivial-rewrite\fR(8) daemon.
.IP \(bu
Eliminate duplicate envelope recipient addresses.
.PP
The following address transformations are optional:
.IP \(bu
Optionally, rewrite all envelope and header addresses according
to the mappings specified in the \fBcanonical\fR(5) lookup tables.
.IP \(bu
Optionally, masquerade envelope sender addresses and message
header addresses (i.e. strip host or domain information below
all domains listed in the \fBmasquerade_domains\fR parameter,
except for user names listed in \fBmasquerade_exceptions\fR).
By default, address masquerading does not affect envelope recipients.
.IP \(bu
Optionally, expand envelope recipients according to information
found in the \fBvirtual\fR(5) lookup tables.
.PP
The \fBcleanup\fR daemon performs sanity checks on the content of
each message. When it finds a problem, by default it returns a
diagnostic status to the client, and leaves it up to the client
to deal with the problem. Alternatively, the client can request
the \fBcleanup\fR daemon to bounce the message back to the sender
in case of trouble.

.SH "CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.na

Changes to \fBmain.cf\fR are picked up automatically, as cleanup(8)
