Postfix local mail delivery
.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
.nf
\fBlocal\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBlocal\fR daemon processes delivery requests from the
Postfix queue manager to deliver mail to local recipients.
Each delivery request specifies a queue file, a sender address,
a domain or host to deliver to, and one or more recipients.
This program expects to be run from the \fBmaster\fR(8) process
manager.

The \fBlocal\fR daemon updates queue files and marks recipients
as finished, or it informs the queue manager that delivery should
be tried again at a later time. Delivery problem reports are sent
to the \fBbounce\fR(8) or \fBdefer\fR(8) daemon as appropriate.
.SH SYSTEM-WIDE AND USER-LEVEL ALIASING
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The system adminstrator can set up one or more system-wide
\fBsendmail\fR-style alias databases.
Users can have \fBsendmail\fR-style ~/.\fBforward\fR files.
Mail for \fIname\fR is delivered to the alias \fIname\fR, to
destinations in ~\fIname\fR/.\fBforward\fR, to the mailbox owned
by the user \fIname\fR, or it is sent back as undeliverable.

The system administrator can specify a comma/space separated list
of ~\fR/.\fBforward\fR like files through the \fBforward_path\fR
configuration parameter. Upon delivery, the local delivery agent
tries each pathname in the list until a file is found.
The \fBforward_path\fR parameter is subject to interpolation of
\fB$user\fR (recipient username), \fB$home\fR (recipient home
directory), \fB$shell\fR (recipient shell), \fB$recipient\fR
(complete recipient address), \fB$extension\fR (recipient address
extension), \fB$domain\fR (recipient domain), \fBlocal\fR
(entire recipient address localpart) and
\fB$recipient_delimiter.\fR The forms \fI${name?value}\fR and
\fI${name:value}\fR expand conditionally to \fIvalue\fR when
\fI$name\fR is (is not) defined.
Characters that may have special meaning to the shell or file system
are replaced by underscores.  The list of acceptable characters
is specified with the \fBforward_expansion_filter\fR configuration
parameter.

An alias or ~/.\fBforward\fR file may list any combination of external
commands, destination file names, \fB:include:\fR directives, or
mail addresses.
See \fBaliases\fR(5) for a precise description. Each line in a
user's .\fBforward\fR file has the same syntax as the right-hand part
of an alias.

When an address is found in its own alias expansion, delivery is
made to the user instead. When a user is listed in the user's own
~/.\fBforward\fR file, delivery is made to the user's mailbox instead.
An empty ~/.\fBforward\fR file means do not forward mail.

In order to prevent the mail system from using up unreasonable
amounts of memory, input records read from \fB:include:\fR or from
~/.\fBforward\fR files are broken up into chunks of length
\fBline_length_limit\fR.

While expanding aliases, ~/.\fBforward\fR files, and so on, the
program attempts to avoid duplicate deliveries. The
\fBduplicate_filter_limit\fR configuration parameter limits the
number of remembered recipients.
.SH MAIL FORWARDING
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
For the sake of reliability, forwarded mail is re-submitted as
a new message, so that each recipient has a separate on-file
delivery status record.

In order to stop mail forwarding loops early, the software adds an
optional
\fBDelivered-To:\fR header with the envelope recipient address. If
mail arrives for a recipient that is already listed in a
\fBDelivered-To:\fR header, the message is bounced.
.SH MAILBOX DELIVERY
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The default per-user mailbox is a file in the UNIX mail spool
directory (\fB/var/mail/\fIuser\fR or \fB/var/spool/mail/\fIuser\fR);
the location can be specified with the \fBmail_spool_directory\fR
configuration parameter.

Alternatively, the per-user mailbox can be a file in the user's home
directory with a name specified via the \fBhome_mailbox\fR
configuration parameter. Specify a relative path name. Specify a name
ending in \fB/\fR for \fBqmail\fR-compatible \fBmaildir\fR delivery.

Mailbox delivery can be delegated to an external command specified
with the \fBmailbox_command\fR configuration parameter. The command
executes with the privileges of the recipient user (exception: in
case of delivery as root, the command executes with the privileges
of \fBdefault_privs\fR).

Mailbox delivery can be delegated to alternative message transports
specified in the \fBmaster.cf\fR file.
The \fBmailbox_transport\fR configuration parameter specifies a
message transport that is to be used for all local recipients,
regardless of whether they are found in the UNIX passwd database.
The \fBfallback_transport\fR parameter specifies a message transport
for recipients that are not found in the UNIX passwd database.

In the case of UNIX-style mailbox delivery,
the \fBlocal\fR daemon prepends a "\fBFrom \fIsender time_stamp\fR"
envelope header to each message, prepends an
optional \fBDelivered-To:\fR header
with the envelope recipient address, prepends a \fBReturn-Path:\fR
header with the envelope sender address, prepends a \fB>\fR character
to lines beginning with "\fBFrom \fR", and appends an empty line.
The mailbox is locked for exclusive access while delivery is in
progress. In case of problems, an attempt is made to truncate the
mailbox to its original length.

In the case of \fBmaildir\fR delivery, the local daemon prepends
an optional
\fBDelivered-To:\fR header with the envelope recipient address
and prepends a \fBReturn-Path:\fR header with the envelope sender
address.
.SH EXTERNAL COMMAND DELIVERY
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The \fBallow_mail_to_commands\fR configuration parameter restricts
delivery to external commands. The default setting (\fBalias,
forward\fR) forbids command destinations in \fB:include:\fR files.

The command is executed directly where possible. Assistance by the
shell (\fB/bin/sh\fR on UNIX systems) is used only when the command
contains shell magic characters, or when the command invokes a shell
built-in command.

A limited amount of command output (standard output and standard
error) is captured for inclusion with non-delivery status reports.
A command is forcibly terminated if it does not complete within
\fBcommand_time_limit\fR seconds.  Command exit status codes are
expected to follow the conventions defined in <\fBsysexits.h\fR>.

A limited amount of message context is exported via environment
variables. Characters that may have special meaning to the shell
are replaced by underscores.  The list of acceptable characters
is specified with the \fBcommand_expansion_filter\fR configuration
parameter.
.IP \fBSHELL\fR
The recipient user's login shell.
.IP \fBHOME\fR
The recipient user's home directory.
.IP \fBUSER\fR
The bare recipient name.
.IP \fBEXTENSION\fR
The optional recipient address extension.
.IP \fBDOMAIN\fR
The recipient address domain part.
.IP \fBLOGNAME\fR
The bare recipient name.
.IP \fBLOCAL\fR
The entire recipient address localpart (text to the left of the
rightmost @ character).
.IP \fBRECIPIENT\fR
The entire recipient address.
.PP
The \fBPATH\fR environment variable is always reset to a
system-dependent default path, and the \fBTZ\fR (time zone)
environment variable is always passed on without change.

The current working directory is the mail queue directory.

The \fBlocal\fR daemon prepends a "\fBFrom \fIsender time_stamp\fR"
envelope header to each message, prepends an
optional \fBDelivered-To:\fR
header with the recipient envelope address, prepends a
\fBReturn-Path:\fR header with the sender envelope address,
and appends no empty line.
.SH EXTERNAL FILE DELIVERY
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The \fBallow_mail_to_files\fR configuration parameter restricts
delivery to external files. The default setting (\fBalias,
forward\fR) forbids file destinations in \fB:include:\fR files.
Specify a pathname ending in \fB/\fR for \fBqmail\fR-compatible
\fBmaildir\fR delivery.

The \fBlocal\fR daemon prepends a "\fBFrom \fIsender time_stamp\fR"
envelope header to each message, prepends an
optional \fBDelivered-To:\fR
header with the recipient envelope address, prepends a \fB>\fR
character to lines beginning with "\fBFrom \fR", and appends an
empty line.
The envelope sender address is available in the \fBReturn-Path:\fR
header.
When the destination is a regular file, it is locked for exclusive
access while delivery is in progress. In case of problems, an attempt
is made to truncate a regular file to its original length.

In the case of \fBmaildir\fR delivery, the local daemon prepends
an optional
\fBDelivered-To:\fR header with the envelope recipient address.
The envelope sender address is available in the \fBReturn-Path:\fR
header.
.SH ADDRESS EXTENSION
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The optional \fBrecipient_delimiter\fR configuration parameter
specifies how to separate address extensions from local recipient
names.

For example, with "\fBrecipient_delimiter = +\fR", mail for
\fIname\fR+\fIfoo\fR is delivered to the alias \fIname\fR+\fIfoo\fR
or to the alias \fIname\fR, to the destinations listed in
~\fIname\fR/.\fBforward\fR+\fIfoo\fR or in ~\fIname\fR/.\fBforward\fR,
to the mailbox owned by the user \fIname\fR, or it is sent back as
undeliverable.

In all cases the \fBlocal\fR daemon prepends an optional
`\fBDelivered-To:\fR \fIname\fR+\fIfoo\fR' header line.
.SH DELIVERY RIGHTS
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
Deliveries to external files and external commands are made with
the rights of the receiving user on whose behalf the delivery is made.
In the absence of a user context, the \fBlocal\fR daemon uses the
owner rights of the \fB:include:\fR file or alias database.
When those files are owned by the superuser, delivery is made with
the rights specified with the \fBdefault_privs\fR configuration
parameter.
.SH STANDARDS
.na
.nf
RFC 822 (ARPA Internet Text Messages)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems and transactions are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8).
Corrupted message files are marked so that the queue
manager can move them to the \fBcorrupt\fR queue afterwards.

Depending on the setting of the \fBnotify_classes\fR parameter,
the postmaster is notified of bounces and of other trouble.
.SH BUGS
.ad
.fi
For security reasons, the message delivery status of external commands
or of external files is never checkpointed to file. As a result,
the program may occasionally deliver more than once to a command or
external file. Better safe than sorry.

Mutually-recursive aliases or ~/.\fBforward\fR files are not detected
early.  The resulting mail forwarding loop is broken by the use of the
\fBDelivered-To:\fR message header.
.SH CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The following \fBmain.cf\fR parameters are especially relevant to
this program. See the Postfix \fBmain.cf\fR file for syntax details
