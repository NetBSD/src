.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
.nf
\fBshowq\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBshowq\fR daemon reports the Postfix mail queue status.
It is the program that emulates the sendmail `mailq' command.

The \fBshowq\fR daemon can also be run in stand-alone mode
by the super-user. This mode of operation is used to emulate
the `mailq' command while the Postfix mail system is down.
.SH SECURITY
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The \fBshowq\fR daemon can run in a chroot jail at fixed low
privilege, and takes no input from the client. Its service port
is accessible to local untrusted users, so the service can be
susceptible to denial of service attacks.
.SH STANDARDS
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
None. The showq daemon does not interact with the outside world.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems and transactions are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8).
.SH BUGS
.ad
.fi
The \fBshowq\fR daemon runs at a fixed low privilege; consequently,
it cannot extract information from queue files in the
\fBmaildrop\fR directory.
