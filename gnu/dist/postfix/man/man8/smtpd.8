Postfix SMTP server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
.nf
\fBsmtpd\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The SMTP server accepts network connection requests
and performs zero or more SMTP transactions per connection.
Each received message is piped through the \fBcleanup\fR(8)
daemon, and is placed into the \fBincoming\fR queue as one
single queue file.  For this mode of operation, the program
expects to be run from the \fBmaster\fR(8) process manager.

Alternatively, the SMTP server takes an established
connection on standard input and deposits messages directly
into the \fBmaildrop\fR queue. In this so-called stand-alone
mode, the SMTP server can accept mail even while the mail
system is not running.

The SMTP server implements a variety of policies for connection
requests, and for parameters given to \fBHELO, ETRN, MAIL FROM, VRFY\fR
and \fBRCPT TO\fR commands. They are detailed below and in the
\fBmain.cf\fR configuration file.
.SH SECURITY
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The SMTP server is moderately security-sensitive. It talks to SMTP
clients and to DNS servers on the network. The SMTP server can be
run chrooted at fixed low privilege.
.SH STANDARDS
.na
.nf
RFC 821 (SMTP protocol)
RFC 1123 (Host requirements)
RFC 1652 (8bit-MIME transport)
RFC 1869 (SMTP service extensions)

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems and transactions are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8).

Depending on the setting of the \fBnotify_classes\fR parameter,
the postmaster is notified of bounces, protocol problems,
policy violations, and of other trouble.
.SH CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
.na

.ad
.fi
The following \fBmain.cf\fR parameters are especially relevant to
this program. See the Postfix \fBmain.cf\fR file for syntax details

a configuration change.
.SH "Compatibility controls"
