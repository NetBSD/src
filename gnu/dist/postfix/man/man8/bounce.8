Postfix message bounce or defer daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
.nf
\fBbounce\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBbounce\fR daemon maintains per-message log files with
non-delivery status information. Each log file is named after the
queue file that it corresponds to, and is kept in a queue subdirectory
named after the service name in the \fBmaster.cf\fR file (either
\fBbounce\fR or \fBdefer\fR).
This program expects to be run from the \fBmaster\fR(8) process
manager.

The \fBbounce\fR daemon processes two types of service requests:
.IP \(bu
Append a recipient status record to a per-message log file.
.IP \(bu
Post a bounce message, with a copy of a log file and of the
corresponding message. When the bounce is posted successfully,
the log file is deleted.
.PP
The software does a best effort to notify the sender that there
was a problem. A notification is sent even when the log file
or original message cannot be read.

Optionally, a client can request that the per-message log file be
deleted when the requested operation fails.
This is used by clients that cannot retry transactions by
themselves, and that depend on retry logic in their own client.
.SH STANDARDS

RFC 822 (ARPA Internet Text Messages)

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems and transactions are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8).
.SH BUGS
.ad
.fi
The log files use an ad-hoc, unstructured format. This will have
to change in order to easily support standard delivery status
notifications.
