Postfix address rewriting and resolving daemon
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.na
.nf
\fBtrivial-rewrite\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBtrivial-rewrite\fR daemon processes three types of client
service requests:
.IP \fBrewrite\fR
Rewrite an address to standard form. The \fBtrivial-rewrite\fR
daemon by default appends local domain information to unqualified
addresses, swaps bang paths to domain form, and strips source
routing information. This process is under control of several
configuration parameters (see below).
.IP \fBresolve\fR
Resolve an address to a (\fItransport\fR, \fInexthop\fR,
\fIrecipient\fR) triple. The meaning of the results is as follows:
.RS
.IP \fItransport\fR
The delivery agent to use. This is the first field of an entry
in the \fBmaster.cf\fR file.
.IP \fInexthop\fR
The host to send to and optional delivery method information.
.IP \fIrecipient\fR
The envelope recipient address that is passed on to \fInexthop\fR.
.RE
.IP \fBverify\fR
Resolve an address for address verification purposes.
.SH "SERVER PROCESS MANAGEMENT"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The trivial-rewrite servers run under control by the Postfix master
server.  Each server can handle multiple simultaneous connections.
When all servers are busy while a client connects, the master
creates a new server process, provided that the trivial-rewrite
server process limit is not exceeded.
Each trivial-rewrite server terminates after
serving at least \fB$max_use\fR clients of after \fB$max_idle\fR
seconds of idle time.
.SH "STANDARDS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
None. The command does not interact with the outside world.
.SH "SECURITY"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The \fBtrivial-rewrite\fR daemon is not security sensitive.
By default, this daemon does not talk to remote or local users.
It can run at a fixed low privilege in a chrooted environment.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems and transactions are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8).
.SH "CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
On busy mail systems a long time may pass before a \fBmain.cf\fR
change affecting trivial_rewrite(8) is picked up. Use the command
"\fBpostfix reload\fR" to speed up a change.

The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
postconf(5) for more details including examples.
.SH "COMPATIBILITY CONTROLS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
.IP "\fBresolve_dequoted_address (yes)\fR"
Resolve a recipient address safely instead of correctly, by
looking inside quotes.
.IP "\fBresolve_null_domain (no)\fR"
Resolve an address that ends in the "@" null domain as if the
local hostname were specified, instead of rejecting the address as
invalid.
.SH "ADDRESS REWRITING CONTROLS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
.IP "\fBmyorigin ($myhostname)\fR"
The default domain name that locally-posted mail appears to come
from, and that locally posted mail is delivered to.
.IP "\fBallow_percent_hack (yes)\fR"
Enable the rewriting of the form "user%domain" to "user@domain".
.IP "\fBappend_at_myorigin (yes)\fR"
Append the string "@$myorigin" to mail addresses without domain
information.
.IP "\fBappend_dot_mydomain (yes)\fR"
Append the string ".$mydomain" to addresses that have no ".domain"
information.
.IP "\fBrecipient_delimiter (empty)\fR"
The separator between user names and address extensions (user+foo).
.IP "\fBswap_bangpath (yes)\fR"
Enable the rewriting of "site!user" into "user@site".

The following is applicable to Postfix version 2.0 and later.
Earlier versions do not have support for: virtual_transport,
relay_transport, virtual_alias_domains, virtual_mailbox_domains
or proxy_interfaces.
.IP "\fBlocal_transport (local:$myhostname)\fR"
The default mail delivery transport for domains that match
$mydestination, $inet_interfaces or $proxy_interfaces.
.IP "\fBvirtual_transport (virtual)\fR"
The default mail delivery transport for domains that match the
$virtual_mailbox_domains parameter value.
.IP "\fBrelay_transport (relay)\fR"
The default mail delivery transport and next-hop information for
domains that match the $relay_domains parameter value.
.IP "\fBdefault_transport (smtp)\fR"
The default mail delivery transport for domains that do not match
$mydestination, $inet_interfaces, $proxy_interfaces,
$virtual_alias_domains, $virtual_mailbox_domains, or $relay_domains.
.IP "\fBparent_domain_matches_subdomains (see 'postconf -d' output)\fR"
What Postfix features match subdomains of "domain.tld" automatically,
instead of requiring an explicit ".domain.tld" pattern.
.IP "\fBrelayhost (empty)\fR"
The default host to send non-local mail to when no entry is matched
in the optional transport(5) table.
.IP "\fBtransport_maps (empty)\fR"
Optional lookup tables with mappings from recipient address to
(message delivery transport, next-hop destination).
.SH "ADDRESS VERIFICATION CONTROLS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
Postfix version 2.1 introduces sender and address verification.
This feature is implemented by sending probe email messages that
are not actually delivered.
By default, address verification probes use the same route
as regular mail. To override specific aspects of message
routing for address verification probes, specify one or more
of the following:
.IP "\fBaddress_verify_local_transport ($local_transport)\fR"
Overrides the local_transport parameter setting for address
verification probes.
.IP "\fBaddress_verify_virtual_transport ($virtual_transport)\fR"
Overrides the virtual_transport parameter setting for address
verification probes.
.IP "\fBaddress_verify_relay_transport ($relay_transport)\fR"
Overrides the relay_transport parameter setting for address
verification probes.
.IP "\fBaddress_verify_default_transport ($default_transport)\fR"
Overrides the default_transport parameter setting for address
verification probes.
.IP "\fBaddress_verify_relayhost ($relayhost)\fR"
Overrides the relayhost parameter setting for address verification
probes.
.IP "\fBaddress_verify_transport_maps ($transport_maps)\fR"
Overrides the transport_maps parameter setting for address verification
probes.
.SH "MISCELLANEOUS CONTROLS"

.nf
.ad
.fi
.IP "\fBconfig_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)\fR"
The default location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf

.IP "\fBdaemon_timeout (18000s)\fR"
How much time a Postfix daemon process may take to handle a
request before it is terminated by a built-in watchdog timer.
.IP "\fBempty_address_recipient (MAILER-DAEMON)\fR"
The recipient of mail addressed to the null address.
.IP "\fBipc_timeout (3600s)\fR"
The time limit for sending or receiving information over an internal
communication channel.
.IP "\fBmax_idle (100s)\fR"
The maximum amount of time that an idle Postfix daemon process
waits for the next service request before exiting.
.IP "\fBmax_use (100)\fR"
The maximal number of connection requests before a Postfix daemon
process terminates.
.IP "\fBrelocated_maps (empty)\fR"
Optional lookup tables with new contact information for users or
domains that no longer exist.
.IP "\fBprocess_id (read-only)\fR"
The process ID of a Postfix command or daemon process.
.IP "\fBprocess_name (read-only)\fR"
The process name of a Postfix command or daemon process.

The location of the Postfix top-level queue directory.
.IP "\fBshow_user_unknown_table_name (yes)\fR"
Display the name of the recipient table in the "User unknown"
responses.
.IP "\fBsyslog_facility (mail)\fR"
The syslog facility of Postfix logging.
.IP "\fBsyslog_name (postfix)\fR"
The mail system name that is prepended to the process name in syslog

.IP "\fBhelpful_warnings (yes)\fR"
