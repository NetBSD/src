Postfix local mail pickup
.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
.nf
\fBpickup\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBpickup\fR daemon waits for hints that new mail has been
dropped into the world-writable \fBmaildrop\fR directory, and
feeds it into the \fBcleanup\fR(8) daemon.
Ill-formatted files are deleted without notifying the originator.
This program expects to be run from the \fBmaster\fR(8) process
manager.
.SH STANDARDS
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
None. The \fBpickup\fR daemon does not interact with the outside world.
.SH SECURITY
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The \fBpickup\fR daemon runs with superuser privileges so that it
1) can open a queue file with the rights of the submitting user
and 2) can access the Postfix private IPC channels.
On the positive side, the program can run chrooted, opens no files
for writing, is careful about what files it opens for reading, and
does not actually touch any data that is sent to its public service
endpoint.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems and transactions are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8).
.SH BUGS
.ad
.fi
The \fBpickup\fR daemon copies mail from file to the \fBcleanup\fR(8)
daemon.  It could avoid message copying overhead by sending a file
descriptor instead of file data, but then the already complex
\fBcleanup\fR(8) daemon would have to deal with unfiltered user data.
.SH CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The following \fBmain.cf\fR parameters are especially relevant to
this program. See the Postfix \fBmain.cf\fR file for syntax details
and for default values. Use the \fBpostfix reload\fR command after
a configuration change.
.SH "Content inspection controls"
.IP \fBcontent_filter\fR
The name of a mail delivery transport that filters mail and that
either bounces mail or re-injects the result back into Postfix.
This parameter uses the same syntax as the right-hand side of
a Postfix transport table.
.SH Miscellaneous
.ad
.fi
.IP \fBalways_bcc\fR
Address to send a copy of each message that enters the system.
.IP \fBmail_owner\fR
The process privileges used while not opening a \fBmaildrop\fR file.
.IP \fBqueue_directory\fR
Top-level directory of the Postfix queue.
