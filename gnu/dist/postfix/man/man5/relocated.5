format of Postfix relocated table
.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
.nf
\fBpostmap /etc/postfix/relocated\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The optional \fBrelocated\fR table provides the information that is
used in "user has moved to \fInew_location\fR" bounce messages.

Normally, the \fBrelocated\fR table is specified as a text file
that serves as input to the \fBpostmap\fR(1) command.
The result, an indexed file in \fBdbm\fR or \fBdb\fR format,
is used for fast searching by the mail system. Execute the command
\fBpostmap /etc/postfix/relocated\fR in order to rebuild the indexed
file after changing the relocated table.

When the table is provided via other means such as NIS, LDAP
or SQL, the same lookups are done as for ordinary indexed files.

Alternatively, the table can be provided as a regular-expression
map where patterns are given as regular expressions. In that case,
the lookups are done in a slightly different way as described below.

Table lookups are case insensitive.
.SH TABLE FORMAT
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The format of the table is as follows:
.IP \(bu
An entry has one of the following form:
.ti +5
\fIkey  new_location\fR
.br
Where \fInew_location\fR specifies contact information such as
an email address, or perhaps a street address or telephone number.
.IP \(bu
Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored, as
are lines whose first non-whitespace character is a `#'.
.IP \(bu
A logical line starts with non-whitespace text. A line that
starts with whitespace continues a logical line.
.PP
With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from networked
tables such as NIS, LDAP or SQL, the \fIkey\fR field is one of the
following:
.IP \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR
Matches \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR. This form has precedence over all
other forms.
.IP \fIuser\fR
Matches \fIuser\fR@\fIsite\fR when \fIsite\fR is $\fBmyorigin\fR,
when \fIsite\fR is listed in $\fBmydestination\fR, or when \fIsite\fR
is listed in $\fBinet_interfaces\fR.
.IP @\fIdomain\fR
Matches every address in \fIdomain\fR. This form has the lowest
precedence.
.SH ADDRESS EXTENSION
.na
.nf
.fi
.ad
When a mail address localpart contains the optional recipient delimiter
(e.g., \fIuser+foo\fR@\fIdomain\fR), the lookup order becomes:
\fIuser+foo\fR@\fIdomain\fR, \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR, \fIuser+foo\fR,
\fIuser\fR, and @\fIdomain\fR.
.SH REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
This section describes how the table lookups change when the table
is given in the form of regular expressions. For a description of
regular expression lookup table syntax, see \fBregexp_table\fR(5)
or \fBpcre_table\fR(5).

Each pattern is a regular expression that is applied to the entire
address being looked up. Thus, \fIuser@domain\fR mail addresses are not
broken up into their \fIuser\fR and \fI@domain\fR constituent parts,
nor is \fIuser+foo\fR broken up into \fIuser\fR and \fIfoo\fR.

Patterns are applied in the order as specified in the table, until a
pattern is found that matches the search string.

Results are the same as with indexed file lookups, with
the additional feature that parenthesized substrings from the
pattern can be interpolated as \fB$1\fR, \fB$2\fR and so on.
.SH BUGS
.ad
.fi
The table format does not understand quoting conventions.
.SH CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS

The following \fBmain.cf\fR parameters are especially relevant to
this topic. See the Postfix \fBmain.cf\fR file for syntax details
and for default values. Use the \fBpostfix reload\fR command after
a configuration change.
.IP \fBrelocated_maps\fR
List of lookup tables for relocated users or sites.
.PP
Other parameters of interest:
.IP \fBinet_interfaces\fR
The network interface addresses that this system receives mail on.
.IP \fBmydestination\fR
List of domains that this mail system considers local.
.IP \fBmyorigin\fR
The domain that is appended to locally-posted mail.
