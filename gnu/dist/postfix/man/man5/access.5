.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The optional \fBaccess\fR table directs the Postfix SMTP server
to selectively reject or accept mail. Access can be allowed or
denied for specific host names, domain names, networks, host
network addresses or mail addresses.

For an example, see the EXAMPLE section at the end of this
manual page.

Normally, the \fBaccess\fR table is specified as a text file
that serves as input to the \fBpostmap\fR(1) command.
The result, an indexed file in \fBdbm\fR or \fBdb\fR format,
is used for fast searching by the mail system. Execute the command
\fBpostmap /etc/postfix/access\fR in order to rebuild the indexed
file after changing the access table.

When the table is provided via other means such as NIS, LDAP
or SQL, the same lookups are done as for ordinary indexed files.

Alternatively, the table can be provided as a regular-expression
map where patterns are given as regular expressions, or lookups
can be directed to TCP-based server. In that case, the lookups are
done in a slightly different way as described below under
"REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES" and "TCP-BASED TABLES".
.SH "TABLE FORMAT"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The input format for the \fBpostmap\fR(1) command is as follows:
.IP "\fIpattern action\fR"
When \fIpattern\fR matches a mail address, domain or host address,
perform the corresponding \fIaction\fR.
.IP "blank lines and comments"
Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored, as
are lines whose first non-whitespace character is a `#'.
.IP "multi-line text"
A logical line starts with non-whitespace text. A line that
starts with whitespace continues a logical line.
.SH "EMAIL ADDRESS PATTERNS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from networked
tables such as NIS, LDAP or SQL, patterns are tried in the order as
listed below:
.IP \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR
Matches the specified mail address.
.IP \fIdomain.tld\fR
Matches \fIdomain.tld\fR as the domain part of an email address.
.sp
The pattern \fIdomain.tld\fR also matches subdomains, but only
when the string \fBsmtpd_access_maps\fR is listed in the Postfix
\fBparent_domain_matches_subdomains\fR configuration setting
(note that this is the default for some versions of Postfix).
Otherwise, specify \fI.domain.tld\fR (note the initial dot) in
order to match subdomains.
.IP \fIuser\fR@
Matches all mail addresses with the specified user part.
.PP
Note: lookup of the null sender address is not possible with
some types of lookup table. By default, Postfix uses \fB<>\fR
as the lookup key for such addresses. The value is specified with
the \fBsmtpd_null_access_lookup_key\fR parameter in the Postfix
\fBmain.cf\fR file.
.SH "EMAIL ADDRESS EXTENSION"
.na
.nf
.fi
.ad
When a mail address localpart contains the optional recipient delimiter
(e.g., \fIuser+foo\fR@\fIdomain\fR), the lookup order becomes:
\fIuser+foo\fR@\fIdomain\fR, \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR, \fIdomain\fR,
\fIuser+foo\fR@, and \fIuser\fR@.
.SH "HOST NAME/ADDRESS PATTERNS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from networked
tables such as NIS, LDAP or SQL, the following lookup patterns are
examined in the order as listed:
.IP \fIdomain.tld\fR
Matches \fIdomain.tld\fR.
.sp
The pattern \fIdomain.tld\fR also matches subdomains, but only
when the string \fBsmtpd_access_maps\fR is listed in the Postfix
\fBparent_domain_matches_subdomains\fR configuration setting.
Otherwise, specify \fI.domain.tld\fR (note the initial dot) in
order to match subdomains.
.IP \fInet.work.addr.ess\fR
.IP \fInet.work.addr\fR
.IP \fInet.work\fR
.IP \fInet\fR
Matches any host address in the specified network. A network
address is a sequence of one or more octets separated by ".".

NOTE: use the \fBcidr\fR lookup table type to specify
network/netmask patterns. See cidr_table(5) for details.
.SH "ACCEPT ACTIONS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
.IP \fBOK\fR
Accept the address etc. that matches the pattern.
.IP \fIall-numerical\fR
An all-numerical result is treated as OK. This format is
generated by address-based relay authorization schemes.
.SH "REJECT ACTIONS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
.IP "\fB4\fINN text\fR"
.IP "\fB5\fINN text\fR"
Reject the address etc. that matches the pattern, and respond with
the numerical three-digit code and text. \fB4\fINN\fR means "try
again later", while \fB5\fINN\fR means "do not try again".
.IP "\fBREJECT \fIoptional text...\fR
Reject the address etc. that matches the pattern. Reply with
\fI$reject_code optional text...\fR when the optional text is
specified, otherwise reply with a generic error response message.
.IP "\fBDEFER_IF_REJECT \fIoptional text...\fR
Defer the request if some later restriction would result in a
REJECT action. Reply with "\fB450\fI optional text...\fR when the
optional text is specified, otherwise reply with a generic error
response message.
.sp
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.
.IP "\fBDEFER_IF_PERMIT \fIoptional text...\fR
Defer the request if some later restriction would result in a
an explicit or implicit PERMIT action.
Reply with "\fB450\fI optional text...\fR when the
optional text is specified, otherwise reply with a generic error
response message.
.sp
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.
.SH "OTHER ACTIONS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
.IP \fIrestriction...\fR
Apply the named UCE restriction(s) (\fBpermit\fR, \fBreject\fR,
\fBreject_unauth_destination\fR, and so on).
.IP "\fBDISCARD \fIoptional text...\fR
Claim successful delivery and silently discard the message.
Log the optional text if specified, otherwise log a generic
message.
.sp
Note: this action currently affects all recipients of the message.
.sp
This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.
.IP \fBDUNNO\fR
Pretend that the lookup key was not found. This
prevents Postfix from trying substrings of the lookup key
(such as a subdomain name, or a network address subnetwork).
.sp
This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.
.IP "\fBFILTER \fItransport:destination\fR"
After the message is queued, send the entire message through
the specified external content filter. The \fItransport:destination\fR
syntax is described in the transport(5) manual page.  More information
about external content filters is in the Postfix FILTER_README file.
.sp
Note: this action overrides the \fBmain.cf content_filter\fR setting,
and currently affects all recipients of the message.
.sp
This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.
.IP "\fBHOLD \fIoptional text...\fR"
Place the message on the \fBhold\fR queue, where it will sit
until someone either deletes it or releases it for delivery.
Log the optional text if specified, otherwise log a generic
message.

Mail that is placed on hold can be examined with the
\fBpostcat\fR(1) command, and can be destroyed or released with
the \fBpostsuper\fR(1) command.
.sp
Note: this action currently affects all recipients of the message.
.sp
This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.
.IP "\fBPREPEND \fIheadername: headervalue\fR"
Prepend the specified message header to the message.
When this action is used multiple times, the first prepended
header appears before the second etc. prepended header.
.sp
Note: this action does not support multi-line message headers.
.sp
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.
.IP "\fBREDIRECT \fIuser@domain\fR"
After the message is queued, send the message to the specified
address instead of the intended recipient(s).
.sp
Note: this action overrides the FILTER action, and currently affects
all recipients of the message.
.sp
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.
.IP "\fBWARN \fIoptional text...\fR
Log a warning with the optional text, together with client information
and if available, with helo, sender, recipient and protocol information.
.sp
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.
.SH "REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES"
.na
.nf

This section describes how the table lookups change when the table
is given in the form of regular expressions. For a description of
regular expression lookup table syntax, see \fBregexp_table\fR(5)
or \fBpcre_table\fR(5).

Each pattern is a regular expression that is applied to the entire
string being looked up. Depending on the application, that string
is an entire client hostname, an entire client IP address, or an
entire mail address. Thus, no parent domain or parent network search
is done, \fIuser@domain\fR mail addresses are not broken up into
their \fIuser@\fR and \fIdomain\fR constituent parts, nor is
\fIuser+foo\fR broken up into \fIuser\fR and \fIfoo\fR.

Patterns are applied in the order as specified in the table, until a
pattern is found that matches the search string.

Actions are the same as with indexed file lookups, with
the additional feature that parenthesized substrings from the
pattern can be interpolated as \fB$1\fR, \fB$2\fR and so on.
.SH "TCP-BASED TABLES"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
This section describes how the table lookups change when lookups
are directed to a TCP-based server. For a description of the TCP
client/server lookup protocol, see \fBtcp_table\fR(5).
This feature is not available in Postfix version 2.1.

Each lookup operation uses the entire query string once.
Depending on the application, that string is an entire client
hostname, an entire client IP address, or an entire mail address.
Thus, no parent domain or parent network search is done,
\fIuser@domain\fR mail addresses are not broken up into
their \fIuser@\fR and \fIdomain\fR constituent parts, nor is
\fIuser+foo\fR broken up into \fIuser\fR and \fIfoo\fR.

Actions are the same as with indexed file lookups.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.na

.fi
The following example uses an indexed file, so that the
order of table entries does not matter. The example permits
access by the client at address 1.2.3.4 but rejects all
other clients in 1.2.3.0/24. Instead of "\fBhash\fR" lookup
tables, some systems use "\fBdbm\fR".  Use the command
"\fBpostconf -m\fR" to find out what lookup tables Postfix
supports on your system.

.na

Execute the command "\fBpostmap /etc/postfix/access\fR" after
editing the file.
