.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The optional \fBcanonical\fR table specifies an address mapping for
local and non-local addresses. The mapping is used by the
\fBcleanup\fR(8) daemon.  The address mapping is recursive.

Normally, the \fBcanonical\fR table is specified as a text file
that serves as input to the \fBpostmap\fR(1) command.
The result, an indexed file in \fBdbm\fR or \fBdb\fR format,
is used for fast searching by the mail system. Execute the command
\fBpostmap /etc/postfix/canonical\fR in order to rebuild the indexed
file after changing the text file.

When the table is provided via other means such as NIS, LDAP
or SQL, the same lookups are done as for ordinary indexed files.

Alternatively, the table can be provided as a regular-expression
map where patterns are given as regular expressions, or lookups
can be directed to TCP-based server. In that case, the lookups are
done in a slightly different way as described below under
"REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES" and "TCP-BASED TABLES".

The \fBcanonical\fR mapping affects both message header addresses
(i.e. addresses that appear inside messages) and message envelope
addresses (for example, the addresses that are used in SMTP protocol
commands). Think Sendmail rule set \fBS3\fR, if you like.

Typically, one would use the \fBcanonical\fR table to replace login
names by \fIFirstname.Lastname\fR, or to clean up addresses produced
by legacy mail systems.

The \fBcanonical\fR mapping is not to be confused with \fIvirtual
domain\fR support. Use the \fBvirtual\fR(5) map for that purpose.

The \fBcanonical\fR mapping is not to be confused with local aliasing.
Use the \fBaliases\fR(5) map for that purpose.
.SH "TABLE FORMAT"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The input format for the \fBpostmap\fR(1) command is as follows:
.IP "\fIpattern result\fR"
When \fIpattern\fR matches a mail address, replace it by the
corresponding \fIresult\fR.
.IP "blank lines and comments"
Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored, as
are lines whose first non-whitespace character is a `#'.
.IP "multi-line text"
A logical line starts with non-whitespace text. A line that
starts with whitespace continues a logical line.
.PP
With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from networked
tables such as NIS, LDAP or SQL, patterns are tried in the order as
listed below:
.IP "\fIuser\fR@\fIdomain address\fR"
\fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR is replaced by \fIaddress\fR. This form
has the highest precedence.
.sp
This is useful to clean up addresses produced by legacy mail systems.
It can also be used to produce \fIFirstname.Lastname\fR style
addresses, but see below for a simpler solution.
.IP "\fIuser address\fR"
\fIuser\fR@\fIsite\fR is replaced by \fIaddress\fR when \fIsite\fR is
equal to $\fBmyorigin\fR, when \fIsite\fR is listed in
$\fBmydestination\fR, or when it is listed in $\fBinet_interfaces\fR
or $\fBproxy_interfaces\fR.
.sp
This form is useful for replacing login names by
\fIFirstname.Lastname\fR.
.IP "@\fIdomain address\fR"
Every address in \fIdomain\fR is replaced by \fIaddress\fR.
This form has the lowest precedence.
.PP
In all the above forms, when \fIaddress\fR has the form
@\fIotherdomain\fR, the result is the same user in \fIotherdomain\fR.
.SH "ADDRESS EXTENSION"
.na
.nf
.fi
.ad
When a mail address localpart contains the optional recipient delimiter
(e.g., \fIuser+foo\fR@\fIdomain\fR), the lookup order becomes:
\fIuser+foo\fR@\fIdomain\fR, \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR, \fIuser+foo\fR,
\fIuser\fR, and @\fIdomain\fR.

The \fBpropagate_unmatched_extensions\fR parameter controls whether
an unmatched address extension (\fI+foo\fR) is propagated to the
result of table lookup.
.SH "REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
This section describes how the table lookups change when the table
is given in the form of regular expressions. For a description of
regular expression lookup table syntax, see \fBregexp_table\fR(5)
or \fBpcre_table\fR(5).

Each pattern is a regular expression that is applied to the entire
address being looked up. Thus, \fIuser@domain\fR mail addresses are not
broken up into their \fIuser\fR and \fI@domain\fR constituent parts,
nor is \fIuser+foo\fR broken up into \fIuser\fR and \fIfoo\fR.

Patterns are applied in the order as specified in the table, until a
pattern is found that matches the search string.

Results are the same as with indexed file lookups, with
the additional feature that parenthesized substrings from the
pattern can be interpolated as \fB$1\fR, \fB$2\fR and so on.
.SH "TCP-BASED TABLES"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
This section describes how the table lookups change when lookups
are directed to a TCP-based server. For a description of the TCP
client/server lookup protocol, see \fBtcp_table\fR(5).
This feature is not available in Postfix version 2.1.

Each lookup operation uses the entire address once.  Thus,
\fIuser@domain\fR mail addresses are not broken up into their
\fIuser\fR and \fI@domain\fR constituent parts, nor is
\fIuser+foo\fR broken up into \fIuser\fR and \fIfoo\fR.

Results are the same as with indexed file lookups.
.SH BUGS

The following \fBmain.cf\fR parameters are especially relevant.
The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
postconf(5) for more details including examples.
