Postfix lookup table management
.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf
.fi
\fBpostmap\fR [\fB-Nfinorvw\fR] [\fB-c \fIconfig_dir\fR]
[\fB-d \fIkey\fR] [\fB-q \fIkey\fR]
[\fIfile_type\fR:]\fIfile_name\fR ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBpostmap\fR command creates or queries one or more Postfix
lookup tables, or updates an existing one. The input and output
file formats are expected to be compatible with:

.ti +4
\fBmakemap \fIfile_type\fR \fIfile_name\fR < \fIfile_name\fR

If the result files do not exist they will be created with the
same group and other read permissions as the source file.

While the table update is in progress, signal delivery is
postponed, and an exclusive, advisory, lock is placed on the
entire table, in order to avoid surprises in spectator
programs.

The format of a lookup table input file is as follows:
.IP \(bu
A table entry has the form
.sp
.ti +5
\fIkey\fR whitespace \fIvalue\fR
.IP \(bu
Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored, as
are lines whose first non-whitespace character is a `#'.
.IP \(bu
A logical line starts with non-whitespace text. A line that
starts with whitespace continues a logical line.
.PP
The \fIkey\fR and \fIvalue\fR are processed as is, except that
surrounding white space is stripped off. Unlike with Postfix alias
databases, quotes cannot be used to protect lookup keys that contain
special characters such as `#' or whitespace. The \fIkey\fR is mapped
to lowercase to make mapping lookups case insensitive.

Options:
.IP \fB-N\fR
Include the terminating null character that terminates lookup keys
and values. By default, Postfix does whatever is the default for
the host operating system.
.IP "\fB-c \fIconfig_dir\fR"
Read the \fBmain.cf\fR configuration file in the named directory
instead of the default configuration directory.
.IP "\fB-d \fIkey\fR"
Search the specified maps for \fIkey\fR and remove one entry per map.
The exit status is zero when the requested information was found.

If a key value of \fB-\fR is specified, the program reads key
values from the standard input stream. The exit status is zero
when at least one of the requested keys was found.
.IP \fB-f\fR
Do not fold the lookup key to lower case while creating or querying
a map.
.IP \fB-i\fR
Incremental mode. Read entries from standard input and do not
truncate an existing database. By default, \fBpostmap\fR creates
a new database from the entries in \fBfile_name\fR.
.IP \fB-n\fR
Don't include the terminating null character that terminates lookup
keys and values. By default, Postfix does whatever is the default for
the host operating system.
.IP \fB-o\fR
Do not release root privileges when processing a non-root
input file. By default, \fBpostmap\fR drops root privileges
and runs as the source file owner instead.
.IP "\fB-q \fIkey\fR"
Search the specified maps for \fIkey\fR and write the first value
found to the standard output stream. The exit status is zero
when the requested information was found.

If a key value of \fB-\fR is specified, the program reads key
values from the standard input stream and writes one line of
\fIkey value\fR output for each key that was found. The exit
status is zero when at least one of the requested keys was found.
.IP \fB-r\fR
When updating a table, do not warn about duplicate entries; silently
replace them.
.IP \fB-v\fR
Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple \fB-v\fR
options make the software increasingly verbose.
.IP \fB-w\fR
When updating a table, do not warn about duplicate entries; silently
ignore them.
.PP
Arguments:
.IP \fIfile_type\fR
The type of database to be produced.
.RS
.IP \fBbtree\fR
The output file is a btree file, named \fIfile_name\fB.db\fR.
This is available only on systems with support for \fBdb\fR databases.
.IP \fBdbm\fR
The output consists of two files, named \fIfile_name\fB.pag\fR and
\fIfile_name\fB.dir\fR.
This is available only on systems with support for \fBdbm\fR databases.
.IP \fBhash\fR
The output file is a hashed file, named \fIfile_name\fB.db\fR.
This is available only on systems with support for \fBdb\fR databases.
.PP
Use the command \fBpostconf -m\fR to find out what types of database
your Postfix installation can support.

When no \fIfile_type\fR is specified, the software uses the database
type specified via the \fBdefault_database_type\fR configuration
parameter.
.RE
.IP \fIfile_name\fR
The name of the lookup table source file when rebuilding a database.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems and transactions are logged to the standard error
stream. No output means no problems. Duplicate entries are
skipped and are flagged with a warning.

\fBpostmap\fR terminates with zero exit status in case of success
(including successful \fBpostmap -q\fR lookup) and terminates
with non-zero exit status in case of failure.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.na
.nf
.ad

.IP \fBMAIL_CONFIG\fR
Directory with Postfix configuration files.
.IP \fBMAIL_VERBOSE\fR
Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes.
.SH CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS

.IP \fBdefault_database_type\fR
Default output database type.
On many UNIX systems, the default database type is either \fBhash\fR
or \fBdbm\fR.
.IP \fBberkeley_db_create_buffer_size\fR
Amount of buffer memory to be used when creating a Berkeley DB
\fBhash\fR or \fBbtree\fR lookup table.
.IP \fBberkeley_db_read_buffer_size\fR
Amount of buffer memory to be used when reading a Berkeley DB
\fBhash\fR or \fBbtree\fR lookup table.
