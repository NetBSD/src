.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
.nf
\fBpostdrop\fR [\fIoption ...\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBpostdrop\fR command creates a file in the \fBmaildrop\fR
directory and copies its standard input to the file.

The command is designed to run with set-gid privileges, and with
group write permission to the \fBmaildrop\fR queue directory.

The \fBpostdrop\fR command is automatically invoked by the
\fBsendmail\fR(1) mail posting agent when the \fBmaildrop\fR
queue directory is not world-writable.

Options:
.IP \fB-v\fR
Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple \fB-v\fR
options make the software increasingly verbose.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS

Fatal errors: malformed input, I/O error, out of memory. Problems
are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8) and to the standard error stream.
When the input is incomplete, or when the process receives a HUP,
INT, QUIT or TERM signal, the queue file is deleted.
