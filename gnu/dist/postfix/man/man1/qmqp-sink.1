.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
\fBqmqp-sink\fR listens on the named host (or address) and port.
It receives messages from the network and throws them away.
The purpose is to measure QMQP client performance, not protocol
compliance.
Connections can be accepted on IPv4 or IPv6 endpoints, or on
UNIX-domain sockets.
IPv4 and IPv6 are the default.
This program is the complement of the \fBqmqp-source\fR(1) program.

Note: this is an unsupported test program. No attempt is made
to maintain compatibility between successive versions.

Arguments:
.IP \fB-4\fR
Support IPv4 only. This option has no effect when
Postfix is built without IPv6 support.
.IP \fB-6\fR
Support IPv6 only. This option is not available when
Postfix is built without IPv6 support.
.IP \fB-c\fR
Display a running counter that is updated whenever a delivery
is completed.
.IP \fB-v\fR
Increase verbosity. Specify \fB-v -v\fR to see some of the QMQP
conversation.
.IP "\fB-x \fItime\fR
Terminate after \fItime\fR seconds. This is to facilitate memory
leak testing.
