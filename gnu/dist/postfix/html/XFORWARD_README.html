<hr>

<h2>Purpose of the XFORWARD extension to SMTP</h2>

<p> The XFORWARD command targets the following problem: </p>

<ul>

    <li> <p> Logging after SMTP-based content filter. With the
    deployment of Internet-&gt;MTA1-&gt;filter-&gt;MTA2 style
    content filter applications, the logging of client and message
    identifying information changes when MTA1 gives the mail to
    the content filter.  To simplify the interpretation of MTA2
    logging, it would help if MTA1 could forward remote client
    and/or message identifying information through the content
    filter to MTA2, so that the information could be logged as part
    of mail handling transactions. </p>

</ul>

<p> This extension is implemented as a separate EMSTP command, and
can be used to transmit client or message attributes incrementally.
It is not implemented by passing additional parameters via the MAIL
FROM command, because doing so would require extending the MAIL
FROM command length limit by another 600 or more characters beyond
the space that is already needed to support other extensions such
as AUTH. </p>

<h2>XFORWARD Command syntax</h2>

<p> An example of a client-server conversation is given at the end
of this document.  </p>

<p> In SMTP server EHLO replies, the keyword associated with this
extension is XFORWARD. The keyword is followed by the names of the
attributes that the XFORWARD implementation supports. </p>

<p> The client may send the XFORWARD request at any time except in
the middle of a mail delivery transaction (i.e.  between MAIL and
DOT).  The command may be pipelined when the server supports 
ESMTP command pipelining.
</p>

<p> The syntax of XFORWARD requests is described below.  Upper case
and quoted strings specify terminals, lowercase strings specify
meta terminals, and SP is whitespace.  Although command and attribute
names are shown in upper case, they are in fact case insensitive.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
    xforward-command = XFORWARD 1*( SP attribute-name"="attribute-value )
</p>
<p>
    attribute-name = ( NAME | ADDR | PROTO | HELO | SOURCE )
</p>
<p>
    attribute-value = xtext
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>

    <li> <p> Attribute values are xtext encoded as per <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1891.html">RFC 1891</a>.
    </p>

    <li> <p> The NAME attribute specifies the up-stream hostname,
    or [UNAVAILABLE] when the information is unavailable. The
    hostname may be a non-DNS hostname. </p>

    <li> <p> The ADDR attribute specifies the up-stream network
    address, or [UNAVAILABLE] when the information is unavailable.
    Address information is not enclosed with []. The address may
    be a non-IP address. </p>

    <li> <p> The PROTO attribute specifies the mail protocol for
    receiving mail from the up-stream host. This may be an SMTP or
    non-SMTP protocol name of up to 64 characters, or [UNAVAILABLE]
    when the information is unavailable. </p>

    <li> <p> The HELO attribute specifies the hostname that the
    up-stream host announced itself with (not necessarily via the
    SMTP HELO command), or [UNAVAILABLE] when the information is
    unavailable. The hostname may be a non-DNS hostname. </p>

    <li> <p> The SOURCE attribute specifies LOCAL when the message
    was received from a source that is local with respect to the
    up-stream host (for example, the message originated from the
    up-stream host itself), REMOTE for all other mail, or [UNAVAILABLE]
    when the information is unavailable. The down-stream MTA may
    decide to enable features such as header munging or address
    qualification with mail from local sources but not other sources.
    </p>

</ul>

<p> Note 1: an attribute-value element must not be longer than
255 characters (specific attributes may impose shorter lengths).
After xtext decoding, attribute values must not contain control
characters, non-ASCII characters, whitespace, or other characters
that are special in message headers.  </p>

<p> Note 2: DNS hostnames can be up to 255 characters long. The
XFORWARD client implementation must not send XFORWARD commands that
exceed the 512 character limit for SMTP commands. </p>

<p> Note 3: [UNAVAILABLE] may be specified in upper case, lower
case or mixed case. </p>

<p> Note 4: the XFORWARD server implementation must not mix
information from the current SMTP session with forwarded information
from an up-stream session. </p>

<p> Note 5: Postfix implementations prior to version 2.3 do not
xtext encode attribute values. Servers that wish to interoperate
with these older implementations should be prepared to receive
unencoded information. </p>

<h2> XFORWARD Server response </h2>

<p> Upon receipt of a correctly formatted XFORWARD command, the
server stores the specified attribute values, and erases the
attributes whose value was specified as [UNAVAILABLE]. All XFORWARD
attributes are reset to the real client information after the MAIL
FROM command completes. </p>

<h2> XFORWARD Server reply codes </h2>

<blockquote>

<table bgcolor="#f0f0ff" border="1">

<tr> <th> Code </th> <th> Meaning </th> </tr>

<tr> <td> 250 </td> <td> success  </td> </tr>

<tr> <td> 421 </td> <td> unable to proceed, disconnecting </td> </tr>

<tr> <td> 501 </td> <td> bad command parameter syntax </td> </tr>

<tr> <td> 503 </td> <td> mail transaction in progress </td> </tr>

<tr> <td> 550 </td> <td> insufficient authorization </td> </tr>

</table>

</blockquote>

<h2>XFORWARD Example</h2>

<p> In the following example, information sent by the client is
shown in bold font. </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
220 server.example.com ESMTP Postfix
<b>EHLO client.example.com</b>
250-server.example.com
250-PIPELINING
250-SIZE 10240000
250-VRFY
250-ETRN
250-XFORWARD NAME ADDR PROTO HELO
250 8BITMIME
<b>XFORWARD NAME=spike.porcupine.org ADDR=168.100.189.2 PROTO=ESMTP </b>
250 Ok
<b>XFORWARD HELO=spike.porcupine.org</b>
250 Ok
<b>MAIL FROM:&lt;wietse@porcupine.org&gt;</b>
250 Ok
<b>RCPT TO:&lt;user@example.com&gt;</b>
250 Ok
<b>DATA</b>
354 End data with &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;
<b>. . .<i>message content</i>. . .</b>
<b>.</b>
250 Ok: queued as 3CF6B2AAE8
<b>QUIT</b>
221 Bye
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p> The XFORWARD command changes audit trails.  Use of this command
must be restricted to authorized clients. </p>

<h2>SMTP connection caching</h2>

<p> SMTP connection caching makes it possible to deliver multiple
messages within the same SMTP session. The XFORWARD attributes are
reset after the MAIL FROM command completes, so there is no risk
of information leakage. </p>
