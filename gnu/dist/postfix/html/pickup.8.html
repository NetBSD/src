PICKUP(8)                                               PICKUP(8)


<b>NAME</b>
       pickup - Postfix local mail pickup

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>pickup</b> [generic Postfix daemon options]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  <b>pickup</b>  daemon waits for hints that new mail has been
       dropped into the world-writable  <b>maildrop</b>  directory,  and
       feeds  it into the <a href="cleanup.8.html"><b>cleanup</b>(8)</a> daemon.  Ill-formatted files
       are deleted without notifying the originator.   This  pro-
       gram expects to be run from the <a href="master.8.html"><b>master</b>(8)</a> process manager.

<b>STANDARDS</b>
       None. The <b>pickup</b> daemon does not interact with the outside
       world.

<b>SECURITY</b>
       The  <b>pickup</b>  daemon runs with superuser privileges so that
       it 1) can open a queue file with the rights of the submit-
       ting  user and 2) can access the Postfix private IPC chan-
       nels.  On the positive side, the program can run chrooted,
       opens no files for writing, is careful about what files it
       opens for reading, and does not actually  touch  any  data
       that is sent to its public service endpoint.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Problems and transactions are logged to <b>syslogd</b>(8).

<b>BUGS</b>
       The  <b>pickup</b> daemon copies mail from file to the <a href="cleanup.8.html"><b>cleanup</b>(8)</a>
       daemon.  It could avoid message copying overhead by  send-
       ing  a  file descriptor instead of file data, but then the
       already complex <a href="cleanup.8.html"><b>cleanup</b>(8)</a> daemon would have to deal  with
       unfiltered user data.

<b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b>
       The  following  <b>main.cf</b> parameters are especially relevant
       to this program. See the Postfix <b>main.cf</b> file  for  syntax
       details  and  for  default  values. Use the <b>postfix</b> <b>reload</b>
       command after a configuration change.

<b>Content</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>controls</b>
       <b>content</b><i>_</i><b>filter</b>
              The name of a mail delivery transport that  filters
              mail and that either bounces mail or re-injects the
              result back into Postfix.  This parameter uses  the
              same  syntax  as  the  right-hand side of a Postfix
              transport table.

<b>Miscellaneous</b>
       <b>always</b><i>_</i><b>bcc</b>
              Address to send a copy of each message that  enters
              the system.
