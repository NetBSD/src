LOCAL(8)                                                 LOCAL(8)

<b>NAME</b>
       local - Postfix local mail delivery

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>local</b> [generic Postfix daemon options]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  <b>local</b>  daemon  processes  delivery  requests from the
       Postfix queue manager to deliver mail to local recipients.
       Each  delivery  request  specifies  a queue file, a sender
       address, a domain or host to deliver to, and one  or  more
       recipients.   This program expects to be run from the <a href="master.8.html"><b>mas-</b></a>
       <a href="master.8.html"><b>ter</b>(8)</a> process manager.

       The <b>local</b> daemon updates queue files and marks  recipients
       as finished, or it informs the queue manager that delivery
       should be tried again at a  later  time.  Delivery  status
       reports  are  sent  to the <a href="bounce.8.html"><b>bounce</b>(8)</a>, <a href="defer.8.html"><b>defer</b>(8)</a> or <a href="trace.8.html"><b>trace</b>(8)</a>
       daemon as appropriate.

<b>SYSTEM-WIDE AND USER-LEVEL ALIASING</b>
       The system administrator can set up one  or  more  system-
       wide <b>sendmail</b>-style alias databases.  Users can have <b>send-</b>
       <b>mail</b>-style ~/.<b>forward</b> files.  Mail for <i>name</i>  is  delivered
       to  the  alias <i>name</i>, to destinations in ~<i>name</i>/.<b>forward</b>, to
       the mailbox owned by the user <i>name</i>, or it is sent back  as
       undeliverable.

       The  system  administrator can specify a comma/space sepa-
       rated list of  ~/.<b>forward</b>  like  files  through  the  <b><a href="postconf.5.html#forward_path">for</a>-</b>
       <b><a href="postconf.5.html#forward_path">ward_path</a></b>  configuration  parameter.  Upon  delivery,  the
       local delivery agent tries each pathname in the list until
       a file is found.  The <b><a href="postconf.5.html#forward_path">forward_path</a></b> parameter is subject to
       interpolation of <b>$user</b> (recipient username), <b>$home</b> (recip-
       ient home directory), <b>$shell</b> (recipient shell), <b>$recipient</b>
       (complete  recipient   address),   <b>$extension</b>   (recipient
       address  extension),  <b>$domain</b>  (recipient  domain),  <b>local</b>
       (entire recipient address localpart) and <b>$<a href="postconf.5.html#recipient_delimiter">recipient_delim</a>-</b>
       <b><a href="postconf.5.html#recipient_delimiter">iter</a>.</b>  The  forms  <i>${name?value}</i>  and <i>${name:value}</i> expand
       conditionally to <i>value</i> when <i>$name</i>  is  (is  not)  defined.
       Characters  that  may have special meaning to the shell or
       file system are replaced  by  underscores.   The  list  of
       acceptable characters is specified with the <b><a href="postconf.5.html#forward_expansion_filter">forward_expan</a>-</b>
       <b><a href="postconf.5.html#forward_expansion_filter">sion_filter</a></b> configuration parameter.

       An alias or ~/.<b>forward</b> file may list  any  combination  of
       external   commands,  destination  file  names,  <b>:include:</b>
       directives, or mail addresses.  See <a href="aliases.5.html"><b>aliases</b>(5)</a> for a  pre-
       cise  description. Each line in a user's .<b>forward</b> file has
       the same syntax as the right-hand part of an alias.

       When an address is  found  in  its  own  alias  expansion,
       delivery  is  made  to  the  user  instead. When a user is
       listed in the user's own ~/.<b>forward</b> file, delivery is made
       to  the  user's mailbox instead.  An empty ~/.<b>forward</b> file
       means do not forward mail.

       In order to prevent the mail system from using  up  unrea-
       sonable   amounts  of  memory,  input  records  read  from
       <b>:include:</b> or from ~/.<b>forward</b>  files  are  broken  up  into
       chunks of length <b><a href="postconf.5.html#line_length_limit">line_length_limit</a></b>.

       While  expanding aliases, ~/.<b>forward</b> files, and so on, the
       program attempts to avoid duplicate deliveries. The <b><a href="postconf.5.html#duplicate_filter_limit">dupli</a>-</b>
       <b><a href="postconf.5.html#duplicate_filter_limit">cate_filter_limit</a></b>  configuration parameter limits the num-
       ber of remembered recipients.

<b>MAIL FORWARDING</b>
       For the sake of reliability, forwarded mail is  re-submit-
       ted  as  a new message, so that each recipient has a sepa-
       rate on-file delivery status record.

       In order to stop mail forwarding loops early, the software
       adds an optional <b>Delivered-To:</b> header with the final enve-
       lope recipient address. If mail arrives  for  a  recipient
       that is already listed in a <b>Delivered-To:</b> header, the mes-
       sage is bounced.

<b>MAILBOX DELIVERY</b>
       The default per-user mailbox is a file in  the  UNIX  mail
       spool  directory (<b>/var/mail/</b><i>user</i> or <b>/var/spool/mail/</b><i>user</i>);
       the location can be specified with  the  <b><a href="postconf.5.html#mail_spool_directory">mail_spool_direc</a>-</b>
       <b><a href="postconf.5.html#mail_spool_directory">tory</a></b>  configuration  parameter. Specify a name ending in <b>/</b>
       for <b>qmail</b>-compatible <b>maildir</b> delivery.

       Alternatively, the per-user mailbox can be a file  in  the
       user's  home  directory  with  a  name  specified  via the
       <b><a href="postconf.5.html#home_mailbox">home_mailbox</a></b> configuration parameter. Specify  a  relative
       path name. Specify a name ending in <b>/</b> for <b>qmail</b>-compatible
       <b>maildir</b> delivery.

       Mailbox delivery can be delegated to an  external  command
       specified  with  the <b><a href="postconf.5.html#mailbox_command">mailbox_command</a></b> configuration parame-
       ter. The command  executes  with  the  privileges  of  the
       recipient  user  (exception:  in case of delivery as root,
       the   command   executes   with    the    privileges    of
       <b><a href="postconf.5.html#default_privs">default_privs</a></b>).

       Mailbox  delivery  can be delegated to alternative message
       transports specified in the  <b>master.cf</b>  file.   The  <b><a href="postconf.5.html#mailbox_transport">mail</a>-</b>
       <b><a href="postconf.5.html#mailbox_transport">box_transport</a></b>  configuration parameter specifies a message
       transport that is to be used  for  all  local  recipients,
       regardless  of  whether  they are found in the UNIX passwd
       database.  The <b><a href="postconf.5.html#fallback_transport">fallback_transport</a></b>  parameter  specifies  a
       message transport for recipients that are not found in the
       UNIX passwd database.

       In the case of UNIX-style mailbox delivery, the <b>local</b> dae-
       mon prepends a "<b>From</b> <i>sender time</i><b>_</b><i>stamp</i>" envelope header to
       each message, prepends an <b>X-Original-To:</b> header  with  the
       recipient   address  as  given  to  Postfix,  prepends  an
       optional <b>Delivered-To:</b>  header  with  the  final  envelope
       recipient address, prepends a <b>Return-Path:</b> header with the
       envelope sender address, prepends a &gt; character  to  lines
       beginning  with  "<b>From</b>  ", and appends an empty line.  The
       mailbox is locked for exclusive access while  delivery  is
       in  progress.  In  case of problems, an attempt is made to
       truncate the mailbox to its original length.

       In the case of <b>maildir</b> delivery, the local daemon prepends
       an  optional  <b>Delivered-To:</b> header with the final envelope
       recipient address, prepends an <b>X-Original-To:</b> header  with
       the  recipient address as given to Postfix, and prepends a
       <b>Return-Path:</b> header with the envelope sender address.

<b>EXTERNAL COMMAND DELIVERY</b>
       The   <b><a href="postconf.5.html#allow_mail_to_commands">allow_mail_to_commands</a></b>    configuration    parameter
       restricts  delivery to external commands. The default set-
       ting (<b>alias,  forward</b>)  forbids  command  destinations  in
       <b>:include:</b> files.

       The  command  is  executed directly where possible. Assis-
       tance by the shell (<b>/bin/sh</b> on UNIX systems) is used  only
       when  the command contains shell magic characters, or when
       the command invokes a shell built-in command.

       A limited amount of command output  (standard  output  and
       standard  error) is captured for inclusion with non-deliv-
       ery status reports.  A command is forcibly  terminated  if
       it  does  not  complete within <b><a href="postconf.5.html#command_time_limit">command_time_limit</a></b> seconds.
       Command exit status codes are expected to follow the  con-
       ventions defined in &lt;<b>sysexits.h</b>&gt;.

       A  limited amount of message context is exported via envi-
       ronment variables. Characters that may have special  mean-
       ing to the shell are replaced by underscores.  The list of
       acceptable characters is specified with the <b><a href="postconf.5.html#command_expansion_filter">command_expan</a>-</b>
       <b><a href="postconf.5.html#command_expansion_filter">sion_filter</a></b> configuration parameter.

       <b>SHELL</b>  The recipient user's login shell.

       <b>HOME</b>   The recipient user's home directory.

       <b>USER</b>   The bare recipient name.

       <b>EXTENSION</b>
              The optional recipient address extension.

       <b>DOMAIN</b> The recipient address domain part.

       <b>LOGNAME</b>
              The bare recipient name.

       <b>LOCAL</b>  The entire recipient address localpart (text to the
              left of the rightmost @ character).

       <b>RECIPIENT</b>
              The entire recipient address.

       <b>SENDER</b> The entire sender address.

       The <b>PATH</b> environment variable is always reset to a system-
       dependent  default  path,  and environment variables whose
       names are blessed by the <b><a href="postconf.5.html#export_environment">export_environment</a></b>  configuration
       parameter are exported unchanged.

       The current working directory is the mail queue directory.

       The <b>local</b> daemon prepends a "<b>From</b> <i>sender time</i><b>_</b><i>stamp</i>" enve-
       lope  header  to  each message, prepends an <b>X-Original-To:</b>
       header with the recipient address  as  given  to  Postfix,
       prepends  an  optional <b>Delivered-To:</b> header with the final
       recipient envelope address, prepends a <b>Return-Path:</b> header
       with  the  sender  envelope  address, and appends no empty
       line.

<b>EXTERNAL FILE DELIVERY</b>
       The delivery format depends on  the  destination  filename
       syntax.   The default is to use UNIX-style mailbox format.
       Specify a name ending in <b>/</b>  for  <b>qmail</b>-compatible  <b>maildir</b>
       delivery.

       The  <b><a href="postconf.5.html#allow_mail_to_files">allow_mail_to_files</a></b> configuration parameter restricts
       delivery to external files. The  default  setting  (<b>alias,</b>
       <b>forward</b>) forbids file destinations in <b>:include:</b> files.

       In the case of UNIX-style mailbox delivery, the <b>local</b> dae-
       mon prepends a "<b>From</b> <i>sender time</i><b>_</b><i>stamp</i>" envelope header to
       each  message,  prepends an <b>X-Original-To:</b> header with the
       recipient  address  as  given  to  Postfix,  prepends   an
       optional  <b>Delivered-To:</b>  header  with  the final recipient
       envelope address, prepends a &gt; character to  lines  begin-
       ning  with  "<b>From</b> ", and appends an empty line.  The enve-
       lope sender  address  is  available  in  the  <b>Return-Path:</b>
       header.   When  the  destination  is a regular file, it is
       locked for exclusive access while delivery is in progress.
       In case of problems, an attempt is made to truncate a reg-
       ular file to its original length.

       In the case of <b>maildir</b> delivery, the local daemon prepends
       an  optional  <b>Delivered-To:</b> header with the final envelope
       recipient address, and prepends an  <b>X-Original-To:</b>  header
       with the recipient address as given to Postfix.  The enve-
       lope sender  address  is  available  in  the  <b>Return-Path:</b>
       header.

<b>ADDRESS EXTENSION</b>
       The  optional  <b><a href="postconf.5.html#recipient_delimiter">recipient_delimiter</a></b> configuration parameter
       specifies how to separate address  extensions  from  local
       recipient names.

       For  example,  with  "<b><a href="postconf.5.html#recipient_delimiter">recipient_delimiter</a>  =  +</b>", mail for
       <i>name</i>+<i>foo</i> is delivered to the  alias  <i>name</i>+<i>foo</i>  or  to  the
       alias  <i>name</i>,  to  the  destinations  listed in ~<i>name</i>/.<b>for-</b>
       <b>ward</b>+<i>foo</i> or in ~<i>name</i>/.<b>forward</b>, to the mailbox owned by the
       user <i>name</i>, or it is sent back as undeliverable.

       In all cases the <b>local</b> daemon prepends an optional `<b>Deliv-</b>
       <b>ered-To:</b> header line with the final recipient address.

<b>DELIVERY RIGHTS</b>
       Deliveries to external files  and  external  commands  are
       made with the rights of the receiving user on whose behalf
       the delivery is made.  In the absence of a  user  context,
       the  <b>local</b>  daemon  uses the owner rights of the <b>:include:</b>
       file or alias database.  When those files are owned by the
       superuser, delivery is made with the rights specified with
       the <b><a href="postconf.5.html#default_privs">default_privs</a></b> configuration parameter.

<b>STANDARDS</b>
       <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc822.html">RFC 822</a> (ARPA Internet Text Messages)

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Problems and transactions are logged to <b>syslogd</b>(8).   Cor-
       rupted  message files are marked so that the queue manager
       can move them to the <b>corrupt</b> queue afterwards.

       Depending on the setting of the <b><a href="postconf.5.html#notify_classes">notify_classes</a></b>  parameter,
       the  postmaster  is notified of bounces and of other trou-
       ble.

<b>BUGS</b>
       For security  reasons,  the  message  delivery  status  of
       external  commands  or  of  external files is never check-
       pointed to file. As a result, the program may occasionally
       deliver more than once to a command or external file. Bet-
       ter safe than sorry.

       Mutually-recursive aliases or  ~/.<b>forward</b>  files  are  not
       detected  early.   The  resulting  mail forwarding loop is
       broken by the use of the <b>Delivered-To:</b> message header.

<b>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS</b>
       Changes  to  <b>main.cf</b>  are  picked  up  automatically,   as
       <a href="local.8.html">local(8)</a>  processes run for only a limited amount of time.
       Use the command "<b>postfix reload</b>" to speed up a change.
