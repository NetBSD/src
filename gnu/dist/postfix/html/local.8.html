LOCAL(8)                                                 LOCAL(8)


<b>NAME</b>
       local - Postfix local mail delivery

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>local</b> [generic Postfix daemon options]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  <b>local</b>  daemon  processes  delivery  requests from the
       Postfix queue manager to deliver mail to local recipients.
       Each  delivery  request  specifies  a queue file, a sender
       address, a domain or host to deliver to, and one  or  more
       recipients.   This program expects to be run from the <a href="master.8.html"><b>mas-</b></a>
       <a href="master.8.html"><b>ter</b>(8)</a> process manager.

       The <b>local</b> daemon updates queue files and marks  recipients
       as finished, or it informs the queue manager that delivery
       should be tried again at a later  time.  Delivery  problem
       reports  are  sent  to the <a href="bounce.8.html"><b>bounce</b>(8)</a> or <a href="defer.8.html"><b>defer</b>(8)</a> daemon as
       appropriate.

<b>SYSTEM-WIDE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>USER-LEVEL</b> <b>ALIASING</b>
       The system adminstrator can set up one or more system-wide
       <b>sendmail</b>-style  alias databases.  Users can have <b>sendmail</b>-
       style ~/.<b>forward</b> files.  Mail for <i>name</i> is delivered to the
       alias  <i>name</i>,  to  destinations  in  ~<i>name</i>/.<b>forward</b>, to the
       mailbox owned by the user <i>name</i>, or  it  is  sent  back  as
       undeliverable.

       The  system  administrator can specify a comma/space sepa-
       rated list of  ~/.<b>forward</b>  like  files  through  the  <b>for-</b>
       <b>ward</b><i>_</i><b>path</b>  configuration  parameter.  Upon  delivery,  the
       local delivery agent tries each pathname in the list until
       a file is found.  The <b>forward</b><i>_</i><b>path</b> parameter is subject to
       interpolation of <b>$user</b> (recipient username), <b>$home</b> (recip-
       ient home directory), <b>$shell</b> (recipient shell), <b>$recipient</b>
       (complete  recipient   address),   <b>$extension</b>   (recipient
       address  extension),  <b>$domain</b>  (recipient  domain),  <b>local</b>
       (entire recipient address localpart) and <b>$recipient</b><i>_</i><b>delim-</b>
       <b>iter.</b>  The  forms  <i>${name?value}</i>  and <i>${name:value}</i> expand
       conditionally to <i>value</i> when <i>$name</i>  is  (is  not)  defined.
       Characters  that  may have special meaning to the shell or
       file system are replaced  by  underscores.   The  list  of
       acceptable characters is specified with the <b>forward</b><i>_</i><b>expan-</b>
       <b>sion</b><i>_</i><b>filter</b> configuration parameter.

       An alias or ~/.<b>forward</b> file may list  any  combination  of
       external   commands,  destination  file  names,  <b>:include:</b>
       directives, or mail addresses.  See <a href="aliases.5.html"><b>aliases</b>(5)</a> for a  pre-
       cise  description. Each line in a user's .<b>forward</b> file has
       the same syntax as the right-hand part of an alias.

       When an address is  found  in  its  own  alias  expansion,
       delivery  is  made  to  the  user  instead. When a user is
       listed in the user's own ~/.<b>forward</b> file, delivery is made



                                                                1





LOCAL(8)                                                 LOCAL(8)


       to  the  user's mailbox instead.  An empty ~/.<b>forward</b> file
       means do not forward mail.

       In order to prevent the mail system from using  up  unrea-
       sonable   amounts  of  memory,  input  records  read  from
       <b>:include:</b> or from ~/.<b>forward</b>  files  are  broken  up  into
       chunks of length <b>line</b><i>_</i><b>length</b><i>_</i><b>limit</b>.

       While  expanding aliases, ~/.<b>forward</b> files, and so on, the
       program attempts to avoid duplicate deliveries. The <b>dupli-</b>
       <b>cate</b><i>_</i><b>filter</b><i>_</i><b>limit</b>  configuration parameter limits the num-
       ber of remembered recipients.

<b>MAIL</b> <b>FORWARDING</b>
       For the sake of reliability, forwarded mail is  re-submit-
       ted  as  a new message, so that each recipient has a sepa-
       rate on-file delivery status record.

       In order to stop mail forwarding loops early, the software
       adds  an  optional  <b>Delivered-To:</b> header with the envelope
       recipient address. If mail arrives for a recipient that is
       already  listed  in a <b>Delivered-To:</b> header, the message is
       bounced.

<b>MAILBOX</b> <b>DELIVERY</b>
       The default per-user mailbox is a file in  the  UNIX  mail
       spool  directory (<b>/var/mail/</b><i>user</i> or <b>/var/spool/mail/</b><i>user</i>);
       the location can be specified with  the  <b>mail</b><i>_</i><b>spool</b><i>_</i><b>direc-</b>
       <b>tory</b> configuration parameter.

       Alternatively,  the  per-user mailbox can be a file in the
       user's home  directory  with  a  name  specified  via  the
       <b>home</b><i>_</i><b>mailbox</b>  configuration  parameter. Specify a relative
       path name. Specify a name ending in <b>/</b> for <b>qmail</b>-compatible
       <b>maildir</b> delivery.

       Mailbox  delivery  can be delegated to an external command
       specified with the <b>mailbox</b><i>_</i><b>command</b>  configuration  parame-
       ter.  The  command  executes  with  the  privileges of the
       recipient user (exception: in case of  delivery  as  root,
       the    command    executes    with   the   privileges   of
       <b>default</b><i>_</i><b>privs</b>).

       Mailbox delivery can be delegated to  alternative  message
       transports  specified  in  the  <b>master.cf</b> file.  The <b>mail-</b>
       <b>box</b><i>_</i><b>transport</b> configuration parameter specifies a  message
       transport  that  is  to  be used for all local recipients,
       regardless of whether they are found in  the  UNIX  passwd
       database.   The  <b>fallback</b><i>_</i><b>transport</b>  parameter specifies a
       message transport for recipients that are not found in the
       UNIX passwd database.

       In the case of UNIX-style mailbox delivery, the <b>local</b> dae-
       mon prepends a "<b>From</b> <i>sender</i> <i>time_stamp</i>" envelope header to



                                                                2





LOCAL(8)                                                 LOCAL(8)


       each  message,  prepends  an optional <b>Delivered-To:</b> header
       with the envelope recipient address,  prepends  a  <b>Return-</b>
       <b>Path:</b>  header with the envelope sender address, prepends a
       &gt; character to lines beginning with "<b>From</b> ",  and  appends
       an empty line.  The mailbox is locked for exclusive access
       while delivery is in progress. In  case  of  problems,  an
       attempt  is  made  to truncate the mailbox to its original
       length.

       In the case of <b>maildir</b> delivery, the local daemon prepends
       an optional <b>Delivered-To:</b> header with the envelope recipi-
       ent address and prepends a <b>Return-Path:</b>  header  with  the
       envelope sender address.

<b>EXTERNAL</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>DELIVERY</b>
       The    <b>allow</b><i>_</i><b>mail</b><i>_</i><b>to</b><i>_</i><b>commands</b>    configuration   parameter
       restricts delivery to external commands. The default  set-
       ting  (<b>alias,</b>  <b>forward</b>)  forbids  command  destinations in
       <b>:include:</b> files.

       The command is executed directly  where  possible.  Assis-
       tance  by the shell (<b>/bin/sh</b> on UNIX systems) is used only
       when the command contains shell magic characters, or  when
       the command invokes a shell built-in command.

       A  limited  amount  of command output (standard output and
       standard error) is captured for inclusion with  non-deliv-
       ery  status  reports.  A command is forcibly terminated if
       it does not complete  within  <b>command</b><i>_</i><b>time</b><i>_</i><b>limit</b>  seconds.
       Command  exit status codes are expected to follow the con-
       ventions defined in &lt;<b>sysexits.h</b>&gt;.

       A limited amount of message context is exported via  envi-
       ronment  variables. Characters that may have special mean-
       ing to the shell are replaced by underscores.  The list of
       acceptable characters is specified with the <b>command</b><i>_</i><b>expan-</b>
       <b>sion</b><i>_</i><b>filter</b> configuration parameter.

       <b>SHELL</b>  The recipient user's login shell.

       <b>HOME</b>   The recipient user's home directory.

       <b>USER</b>   The bare recipient name.

       <b>EXTENSION</b>
              The optional recipient address extension.

       <b>DOMAIN</b> The recipient address domain part.

       <b>LOGNAME</b>
              The bare recipient name.

       <b>LOCAL</b>  The entire recipient address localpart (text to the
              left of the rightmost @ character).



                                                                3





LOCAL(8)                                                 LOCAL(8)


       <b>RECIPIENT</b>
              The entire recipient address.

       The <b>PATH</b> environment variable is always reset to a system-
       dependent default path, and the <b>TZ</b> (time zone) environment
       variable is always passed on without change.

       The current working directory is the mail queue directory.

       The <b>local</b> daemon prepends a "<b>From</b> <i>sender</i> <i>time_stamp</i>" enve-
       lope  header  to each message, prepends an optional <b>Deliv-</b>
       <b>ered-To:</b>  header  with  the  recipient  envelope  address,
       prepends  a  <b>Return-Path:</b>  header with the sender envelope
       address, and appends no empty line.

<b>EXTERNAL</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>DELIVERY</b>
       The <b>allow</b><i>_</i><b>mail</b><i>_</i><b>to</b><i>_</i><b>files</b> configuration parameter  restricts
       delivery  to  external  files. The default setting (<b>alias,</b>
       <b>forward</b>) forbids file  destinations  in  <b>:include:</b>  files.
       Specify  a  pathname  ending  in  <b>/</b>  for  <b>qmail</b>-compatible
       <b>maildir</b> delivery.

       The <b>local</b> daemon prepends a "<b>From</b> <i>sender</i> <i>time_stamp</i>" enve-
       lope  header  to each message, prepends an optional <b>Deliv-</b>
       <b>ered-To:</b>  header  with  the  recipient  envelope  address,
       prepends  a  &gt;  character to lines beginning with "<b>From</b> ",
       and appends an empty line.  The envelope sender address is
       available  in  the <b>Return-Path:</b> header.  When the destina-
       tion is a regular file, it is locked for exclusive  access
       while  delivery  is  in  progress. In case of problems, an
       attempt is made to truncate a regular file to its original
       length.

       In the case of <b>maildir</b> delivery, the local daemon prepends
       an optional <b>Delivered-To:</b> header with the envelope recipi-
       ent  address.  The envelope sender address is available in
       the <b>Return-Path:</b> header.

<b>ADDRESS</b> <b>EXTENSION</b>
       The optional <b>recipient</b><i>_</i><b>delimiter</b>  configuration  parameter
       specifies  how  to  separate address extensions from local
       recipient names.

       For example, with  "<b>recipient</b><i>_</i><b>delimiter</b>  <b>=</b>  <b>+</b>",  mail  for
       <i>name</i>+<i>foo</i>  is  delivered  to  the  alias <i>name</i>+<i>foo</i> or to the
       alias <i>name</i>, to  the  destinations  listed  in  ~<i>name</i>/.<b>for-</b>
       <b>ward</b>+<i>foo</i> or in ~<i>name</i>/.<b>forward</b>, to the mailbox owned by the
       user <i>name</i>, or it is sent back as undeliverable.

       In all cases the <b>local</b> daemon prepends an optional `<b>Deliv-</b>
       <b>ered-To:</b> <i>name</i>+<i>foo</i>' header line.

<b>DELIVERY</b> <b>RIGHTS</b>
       Deliveries  to  external  files  and external commands are



                                                                4





LOCAL(8)                                                 LOCAL(8)


       made with the rights of the receiving user on whose behalf
       the  delivery  is made.  In the absence of a user context,
       the <b>local</b> daemon uses the owner rights  of  the  <b>:include:</b>
       file or alias database.  When those files are owned by the
       superuser, delivery is made with the rights specified with
       the <b>default</b><i>_</i><b>privs</b> configuration parameter.

<b>STANDARDS</b>
       <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc822.html">RFC 822</a> (ARPA Internet Text Messages)

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Problems  and transactions are logged to <b>syslogd</b>(8).  Cor-
       rupted message files are marked so that the queue  manager
       can move them to the <b>corrupt</b> queue afterwards.

       Depending  on the setting of the <b>notify</b><i>_</i><b>classes</b> parameter,
       the postmaster is notified of bounces and of  other  trou-
       ble.

<b>BUGS</b>
       For  security  reasons,  the  message  delivery  status of
       external commands or of external  files  is  never  check-
       pointed to file. As a result, the program may occasionally
       deliver more than once to a command or external file. Bet-
       ter safe than sorry.

       Mutually-recursive  aliases  or  ~/.<b>forward</b>  files are not
       detected early.  The resulting  mail  forwarding  loop  is
       broken by the use of the <b>Delivered-To:</b> message header.

<b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b>
       The  following  <b>main.cf</b> parameters are especially relevant
       to this program. See the Postfix <b>main.cf</b> file  for  syntax
       details  and  for  default  values. Use the <b>postfix</b> <b>reload</b>
       command after a configuration change.

<b>Miscellaneous</b>
       <b>alias</b><i>_</i><b>maps</b>
              List of alias databases.

       <b>biff</b>   Enable or disable notification of new mail via  the
              <b>comsat</b> network service.

       <b>expand</b><i>_</i><b>owner</b><i>_</i><b>alias</b>
              When delivering to an alias that has an owner- com-
              panion alias, set the envelope  sender  address  to
              the  right-hand  side  of  the owner alias, instead
              using of the left-hand side address.
