OQMGR(8)                                                 OQMGR(8)

<b>NAME</b>
       oqmgr - old Postfix queue manager

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>oqmgr</b> [generic Postfix daemon options]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  <b>oqmgr</b>  daemon awaits the arrival of incoming mail and
       arranges for its delivery via Postfix delivery  processes.
       The actual mail routing strategy is delegated to the <a href="trivial-rewrite.8.html"><b>triv-</b></a>
       <a href="trivial-rewrite.8.html"><b>ial-rewrite</b>(8)</a> daemon.  This program  expects  to  be  run
       from the <a href="master.8.html"><b>master</b>(8)</a> process manager.

       Mail  addressed  to  the  local  <b>double-bounce</b>  address is
       logged and discarded.  This stops potential  loops  caused
       by undeliverable bounce notifications.

<b>MAIL QUEUES</b>
       The <b>oqmgr</b> daemon maintains the following queues:

       <b>incoming</b>
              Inbound mail from the network, or mail picked up by
              the local <b>pickup</b> agent from the <b>maildrop</b> directory.

       <b>active</b> Messages  that  the  queue  manager  has opened for
              delivery. Only a  limited  number  of  messages  is
              allowed  to  enter  the  <b>active</b> queue (leaky bucket
              strategy, for a fixed delivery rate).

       <b>deferred</b>
              Mail that could not be  delivered  upon  the  first
              attempt.  The  queue manager implements exponential
              backoff  by  doubling  the  time  between  delivery
              attempts.

       <b>corrupt</b>
              Unreadable  or  damaged  queue files are moved here
              for inspection.

       <b>hold</b>   Messages that are kept  "on  hold"  are  kept  here
              until someone sets them free.

<b>DELIVERY STATUS REPORTS</b>
       The <b>oqmgr</b> daemon keeps an eye on per-message delivery sta-
       tus reports in  the  following  directories.  Each  status
       report file has the same name as the corresponding message
       file:

       <b>bounce</b> Per-recipient status information about why mail  is
              bounced.    These   files  are  maintained  by  the
              <a href="bounce.8.html"><b>bounce</b>(8)</a> daemon.

       <b>defer</b>  Per-recipient status information about why mail  is
              delayed.    These   files  are  maintained  by  the
              <a href="defer.8.html"><b>defer</b>(8)</a> daemon.

       <b>trace</b>  Per-recipient status information as requested  with
              the  Postfix  "<b>sendmail  -v</b>" or "<b>sendmail -bv</b>" com-
              mand.  These files are maintained by  the  <a href="trace.8.html"><b>trace</b>(8)</a>
              daemon.

       The  <b>oqmgr</b> daemon is responsible for asking the <a href="bounce.8.html"><b>bounce</b>(8)</a>,
       <a href="defer.8.html"><b>defer</b>(8)</a> or <a href="trace.8.html"><b>trace</b>(8)</a> daemons to send delivery reports.

<b>STRATEGIES</b>
       The queue manager implements a variety of  strategies  for
       either opening queue files (input) or for message delivery
       (output).

       <b>leaky bucket</b>
              This strategy limits the number of messages in  the
              <b>active</b>  queue  and  prevents the queue manager from
              running out of memory under heavy load.

       <b>fairness</b>
              When the <b>active</b> queue has room, the  queue  manager
              takes  one  message from the <a href="QSHAPE_README.html#incoming_queue"><b>incoming</b> queue</a> and one
              from the <b>deferred</b> queue. This prevents a large mail
              backlog from blocking the delivery of new mail.

       <b>slow start</b>
              This strategy eliminates "thundering herd" problems
              by slowly adjusting the number of parallel deliver-
              ies to the same destination.

       <b>round robin</b>
              The queue manager sorts delivery requests by desti-
              nation.  Round-robin selection prevents one  desti-
              nation from dominating deliveries to other destina-
              tions.

       <b>exponential backoff</b>
              Mail  that  cannot  be  delivered  upon  the  first
              attempt  is  deferred.   The  time interval between
              delivery attempts is doubled after each attempt.

       <b>destination status cache</b>
              The  queue  manager  avoids  unnecessary   delivery
              attempts  by  maintaining  a  short-term, in-memory
              list of unreachable destinations.

<b>TRIGGERS</b>
       On an idle system, the queue manager waits for the arrival
       of  trigger  events,  or it waits for a timer to go off. A
       trigger is a one-byte message.  Depending on  the  message
       received,  the queue manager performs one of the following
       actions (the message is followed by the symbolic  constant
       used internally by the software):

       <b>D (QMGR_REQ_SCAN_DEFERRED)</b>
              Start  a  <a href="QSHAPE_README.html#deferred_queue">deferred queue</a> scan.  If a deferred queue
              scan is already in  progress,  that  scan  will  be
              restarted as soon as it finishes.

       <b>I (QMGR_REQ_SCAN_INCOMING)</b>
              Start  an <a href="QSHAPE_README.html#incoming_queue">incoming queue</a> scan. If an incoming queue
              scan is already in  progress,  that  scan  will  be
              restarted as soon as it finishes.

       <b>A (QMGR_REQ_SCAN_ALL)</b>
              Ignore <a href="QSHAPE_README.html#deferred_queue">deferred queue</a> file time stamps. The request
              affects the next <a href="QSHAPE_README.html#deferred_queue">deferred queue</a> scan.

       <b>F (QMGR_REQ_FLUSH_DEAD)</b>
              Purge all information  about  dead  transports  and
              destinations.

       <b>W (TRIGGER_REQ_WAKEUP)</b>
              Wakeup  call,  This is used by the master server to
              instantiate servers that should not  go  away  for-
              ever.  The  action  is  to  start an <a href="QSHAPE_README.html#incoming_queue">incoming queue</a>
              scan.

       The <b>oqmgr</b> daemon reads an entire buffer worth of triggers.
       Multiple  identical  trigger  requests  are collapsed into
       one, and trigger requests are sorted so that <b>A</b> and <b>F</b>  pre-
       cede  <b>D</b>  and  <b>I</b>.  Thus, in order to force a <a href="QSHAPE_README.html#deferred_queue">deferred queue</a>
       run, one would request <b>A F D</b>; in order to notify the queue
       manager of the arrival of new mail one would request <b>I</b>.

<b>STANDARDS</b>
       None.  The <b>oqmgr</b> daemon does not interact with the outside
       world.

<b>SECURITY</b>
       The <b>oqmgr</b> daemon is not security sensitive. It reads  sin-
       gle-character  messages  from  untrusted  local users, and
       thus may be susceptible to denial of service attacks.  The
       <b>oqmgr</b>  daemon  does  not talk to the outside world, and it
       can be run at fixed low privilege in a  chrooted  environ-
       ment.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Problems and transactions are logged to the syslog daemon.
       Corrupted message files are saved to the <b>corrupt</b> queue for
       further inspection.

       Depending  on the setting of the <b><a href="postconf.5.html#notify_classes">notify_classes</a></b> parameter,
       the postmaster is notified of bounces and of  other  trou-
       ble.

<b>BUGS</b>
       A  single  queue  manager  process has to compete for disk
       access with multiple front-end processes such as <b>smtpd</b>.  A
       sudden  burst  of  inbound mail can negatively impact out-
       bound delivery rates.

<b>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS</b>
       Changes to <b>main.cf</b> are not  picked  up  automatically,  as
       <a href="qmgr.8.html">oqmgr(8)</a>  processes are persistent. Use the command "<b>post-</b>
       <b>fix reload</b>" after a configuration change.
