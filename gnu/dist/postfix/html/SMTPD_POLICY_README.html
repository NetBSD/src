<hr>

<h2>Purpose of Postfix SMTP access policy delegation</h2>

<p> The Postfix SMTP server has a number of built-in mechanisms to
block or accept mail at specific SMTP protocol stages. As of version
2.1, Postfix can delegate policy decisions to an external server
that runs outside Postfix. </p>

<p> With this policy delegation mechanism, a simple <a href="#greylist">
greylist </a> policy can be implemented with only a dozen lines of
Perl, as is shown at the end of this document. A complete example
can be found in the Postfix source code, in the directory
examples/smtpd-policy. </p>

<p> Another example of policy delegation is the SPF policy server
at <a href="http://www.openspf.org/Software">http://www.openspf.org/Software</a>.  </p>

<p> Policy delegation is now the preferred method for adding policies
to Postfix. It's much easier to develop a new feature in few lines
of Perl, Python, Ruby, or TCL, than trying to do the same in C code.
The difference in
performance will be unnoticeable except in the most demanding
environments. On active systems a policy daemon process is used
multiple times, for up to $<a href="postconf.5.html#max_use">max_use</a> incoming SMTP connections. </p>

<p> This document covers the following topics: </p>

</ul>

<h2><a name="protocol">Protocol description</a></h2>

<p> The Postfix policy delegation protocol is really simple. The
client request is a sequence of name=value attributes separated by
newline, and is terminated by an empty line. The server reply is
one name=value attribute and it, too, is terminated by an empty
line. </p>

<p> Here is an example of all the attributes that the Postfix SMTP
server sends in a delegated SMTPD access policy request: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>Postfix version 2.1 and later:</b>
request=smtpd_access_policy
protocol_state=RCPT
protocol_name=SMTP
helo_name=some.domain.tld
queue_id=8045F2AB23
sender=foo@bar.tld
recipient=bar@foo.tld
recipient_count=0
client_address=1.2.3.4
client_name=another.domain.tld
reverse_client_name=another.domain.tld
instance=123.456.7
<b>Postfix version 2.2 and later:</b>
sasl_method=plain
sasl_username=you
sasl_sender=
size=12345
ccert_subject=solaris9.porcupine.org
ccert_issuer=Wietse+20Venema
ccert_fingerprint=C2:9D:F4:87:71:73:73:D9:18:E7:C2:F3:C1:DA:6E:04
<b>Postfix version 2.3 and later:</b>
encryption_protocol=TLSv1/SSLv3
encryption_cipher=DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA
encryption_keysize=256
etrn_domain=
[empty line]
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> Notes: </p>

<ul>

    <li> <p> The "request" attribute is required. In this example
    the request type is "smtpd_access_policy". </p>

    <li> <p> The order of the attributes does not matter. The policy
    server should ignore any attributes that it does not care about.
    </p>

    <li> <p> When the same attribute name is sent more than once,
    the server may keep the first value or the last attribute value.
    </p>

    <li> <p> When an attribute value is unavailable, the client
    either does not send the attribute, sends the attribute with
    an empty value ("name="), or sends a zero value ("name=0") in
    the case of a numerical attribute. </p>

    <li> <p> The "recipient" attribute is available only in the
    "RCPT TO" stage, and in the "DATA" and "END-OF-MESSAGE" stages
    when Postfix accepted only one recipient for the current message.
    </p>

    <li> <p> The "recipient_count" attribute (Postfix 2.3 and later)
    is non-zero only in the "DATA" and "END-OF-MESSAGE" stages. It
    specifies the number of recipients that Postfix accepted for
    the current message.  </p>

    <li> <p> The client address is an IPv4 dotted quad in the form
    1.2.3.4 or it is an IPv6 address in the form 1:2:3::4:5:6.
    </p>

    <li> <p> For a discussion of the differences between reverse
    and verified client_name information, see the
    <a href="postconf.5.html#reject_unknown_client_hostname">reject_unknown_client_hostname</a> discussion in the <a href="postconf.5.html">postconf(5)</a>
    document.  </p>

    <li> <p> An attribute name must not contain "=", null or newline,
    and an attribute value must not contain null or newline. </p>

    <li> <p> The "instance" attribute value can be used to correlate
    different requests regarding the same message delivery. </p>

    <li> <p> The "size" attribute value specifies the message size
    that the client specified in the MAIL FROM command (zero if
    none was specified). With Postfix 2.2 and later, it specifies
    the actual message size when the client sends the END-OF-DATA
    command.
    </p>

    <li> <p> The "sasl_*" attributes (Postfix 2.2 and later) specify
    information about how the client was authenticated via SASL.
    These attributes are empty in case of no SASL authentication.
    </p>

    <li> <p> The "ccert_*" attributes (Postfix 2.2 and later) specify
    information about how the client was authenticated via TLS.
    These attributes are empty in case of no certificate authentication.
    As of Postfix 2.2.11 these attribute values are encoded as
    xtext: some characters are represented by +XX, where XX is the
    two-digit hexadecimal representation of the character value.
    </p>

    <li> <p> The "encryption_*" attributes (Postfix 2.3 and later)
    specify information about how the connection is encrypted. With
    plaintext connections the protocol and cipher attributes are
    empty and the keysize is zero.  </p>

    <li> <p> The "etrn_domain" attribute is defined only in the
    context of the ETRN command, and specifies the ETRN command
    parameter. </p>

</ul>

<p> The following is specific to SMTPD delegated policy requests:
</p>

<ul>

    <li> <p> Protocol names are ESMTP or SMTP. </p>

    <li> <p> Protocol states are CONNECT, EHLO, HELO, MAIL, RCPT,
    DATA, END-OF-MESSAGE, VRFY or ETRN; these are the SMTP protocol
    states where
    the Postfix SMTP server makes an OK/REJECT/HOLD/etc. decision.
    </p>

</ul>

<p> The policy server replies with any action that is allowed in a
Postfix SMTPD <a href="access.5.html">access(5)</a> table. Example: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
action=<a href="postconf.5.html#defer_if_permit">defer_if_permit</a> Service temporarily unavailable
[empty line]
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> This causes the Postfix SMTP server to reject the request with
a 450 temporary error code and with text "Service temporarily
unavailable", if the Postfix SMTP server finds no reason to reject
the request permanently. </p>

<p> In case of trouble the policy server must not send a reply.
Instead the server must log a warning and disconnect.  Postfix will
retry the request at some later time.  </p>

<h2><a name="client_config">Policy client/server configuration</a></h2>

<p> The Postfix delegated policy client can connect to a TCP socket
or to a UNIX-domain socket. Examples: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
inet:127.0.0.1:9998
unix:/some/where/policy
unix:private/policy
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> The first example specifies that the policy server listens on
a TCP socket at 127.0.0.1 port 9998. The second example specifies
an absolute pathname of a UNIX-domain socket. The third example
specifies a pathname relative to the Postfix queue directory; use
this for policy servers that are spawned by the Postfix master
daemon. </p>

<p> To create a policy service that listens on a UNIX-domain socket
called "policy", and that runs under control of the Postfix <a href="spawn.8.html">spawn(8)</a>
daemon, you would use something like this: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
 1 /etc/postfix/<a href="master.5.html">master.cf</a>:
 2     policy  unix  -       n       n       -       0       spawn
 3       user=nobody argv=/some/where/policy-server
 4 
 5 /etc/postfix/<a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>:
 6     <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_recipient_restrictions">smtpd_recipient_restrictions</a> =
 7         ... 
 8         <a href="postconf.5.html#reject_unauth_destination">reject_unauth_destination</a> 
 9         <a href="postconf.5.html#check_policy_service">check_policy_service</a> unix:private/policy 
10         ...
11     policy_time_limit = 3600
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> NOTES: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Lines 2, 11: the Postfix <a href="spawn.8.html">spawn(8)</a> daemon by default kills
its child process after 1000 seconds.  This is too short for a
policy daemon that may run for as long as an SMTP client is connected
to an SMTP server process. The default time limit is overruled in
<a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a> with an explicit "policy_time_limit" setting.  The name of
the parameter is the name of the <a href="master.5.html">master.cf</a> entry ("policy")
concatenated with the "_time_limit" suffix.  </p>

<li> <p> Line 2: specify a "0" process limit instead of the default
"-", to avoid "connection refused" and other problems when the smtpd
process limit exceeds the <a href="postconf.5.html#default_process_limit">default_process_limit</a> setting. </p>

<li> <p> Lines 8, 9: always specify "<a href="postconf.5.html#check_policy_service">check_policy_service</a>" AFTER
"<a href="postconf.5.html#reject_unauth_destination">reject_unauth_destination</a>" or else your system could become an
open relay. </p>

TCP sockets instead: </p>

<h2><a name="greylist">Example: greylist policy server</a></h2>

<p> Greylisting is a defense against junk email that is described at
<a href="http://www.greylisting.org/">http://www.greylisting.org/</a>. The idea was discussed on the
postfix-users mailing list <a
href="http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/postfix/2002-03/0846.html">
one year before it was popularized</a>. </p>

<p> The file examples/smtpd-policy/greylist.pl in the Postfix source
tree implements a simplified greylist policy server. This server
stores a time stamp for every (client, sender, recipient) triple.
By default, mail is not accepted until a time stamp is more than
60 seconds old. This stops junk mail with randomly selected sender
addresses, and mail that is sent through randomly selected open
proxies. It also stops junk mail from spammers that change their
IP address frequently. </p>

<p> Copy examples/smtpd-policy/greylist.pl to /usr/libexec/postfix
or whatever location is appropriate for your system. </p>

<p> In the greylist.pl Perl script you need to specify the
location of the greylist database file, and how long mail will
be delayed before it is accepted. The default settings are:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
$database_name="/var/mta/greylist.db";
$greylist_delay=60;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> The /var/mta directory (or whatever you choose) should be
writable by "nobody", or by whatever username you configure below
in <a href="master.5.html">master.cf</a> for the policy service. </p>

<p> Example: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
# mkdir /var/mta
# chown nobody /var/mta
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> Note: DO NOT create the greylist database in a world-writable
directory such as /tmp or /var/tmp, and DO NOT create the greylist
database in a file system that may run out of space. Postfix can
survive "out of space" conditions with the mail queue and with the
mailbox store, but it cannot survive a corrupted greylist database.
If the file becomes corrupted you may not be able to receive mail
at all until you delete the file by hand. </p>

<p> The greylist.pl Perl script can be run under control by
the Postfix master daemon.  For example, to run the script as user
"nobody", using a UNIX-domain socket that is accessible by Postfix
processes only: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
1 /etc/postfix/<a href="master.5.html">master.cf</a>:
2     policy  unix  -       n       n       -       0       spawn
3       user=nobody argv=/usr/bin/perl /usr/libexec/postfix/greylist.pl
4 
5 /etc/postfix/<a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>:
6      policy_time_limit = 3600
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> Notes: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Line 3: Specify "greylist.pl -v" for verbose logging of
each request and reply. </p>

<li> <p> Lines 2, 6: the Postfix <a href="spawn.8.html">spawn(8)</a> daemon by default kills
its child process after 1000 seconds.  This is too short for a
policy daemon that may run for as long as an SMTP client is connected
to an SMTP server process. The default time limit is overruled in

"-", to avoid "connection refused" and other problems when the smtpd
process limit exceeds the <a href="postconf.5.html#default_process_limit">default_process_limit</a> setting. </p>

</ul>

<p> On Solaris you must use inet: style sockets instead of unix:
style, as detailed in the "<a href="#client_config">Policy
client/server configuration</a>" section above.  </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
1 /etc/postfix/<a href="master.5.html">master.cf</a>:
2     127.0.0.1:9998  inet  n       n       n       -       0       spawn

<p> To invoke this service you would specify "<a href="postconf.5.html#check_policy_service">check_policy_service</a>
inet:127.0.0.1:9998". </p>

<h2><a name="frequent">Greylisting mail from frequently forged domains</a></h2>

<h2><a name="maintenance">Routine greylist maintenance</a></h2>

<p> The greylist database grows over time, because the greylist server
never removes database entries. If left unattended, the greylist
database will eventually run your file system out of space. </p>

<p> When the status file size exceeds some threshold you can simply
rename or remove the file without adverse effects; Postfix
automatically creates a new file. In the worst case, new mail will
be delayed by an hour or so. To lessen the impact, rename or remove
the file in the middle of the night at the beginning of a weekend.
