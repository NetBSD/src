POSTSUPER(1)                                         POSTSUPER(1)

<b>NAME</b>
       postsuper - Postfix superintendent

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>postsuper</b> [<b>-psv</b>] [<b>-c</b> <i>config</i><b>_</b><i>dir</i>] [<b>-d</b> <i>queue</i><b>_</b><i>id</i>]
               [<b>-h</b> <i>queue</i><b>_</b><i>id</i>] [<b>-H</b> <i>queue</i><b>_</b><i>id</i>]
               [<b>-r</b> <i>queue</i><b>_</b><i>id</i>] [<i>directory ...</i>]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The <b>postsuper</b> command does maintenance jobs on the Postfix
       queue. Use of the command is restricted to the  superuser.
       See  the  <b>postqueue</b>  command for unprivileged queue opera-
       tions such as listing or flushing the mail queue.

       By default, <b>postsuper</b> performs  the  operations  requested
       with  the  <b>-s</b>  and  <b>-p</b> command-line options on all Postfix
       queue directories - this includes the <b>incoming</b>, <b>active</b> and
       <b>deferred</b>  directories  with  mail  files  and  the <b>bounce</b>,
       <b>defer</b>, <b>trace</b> and <b>flush</b> directories with log files.

       Options:

       <b>-c</b> <i>config</i><b>_</b><i>dir</i>
              The <b>main.cf</b> configuration  file  is  in  the  named
              directory  instead  of  the  default  configuration
              directory. See  also  the  MAIL_CONFIG  environment
              setting below.

       <b>-d</b> <i>queue</i><b>_</b><i>id</i>
              Delete one message with the named queue ID from the
              named  mail  queue(s)  (default:  <b>hold</b>,   <b>incoming</b>,
              <b>active</b> and <b>deferred</b>).  If a <i>queue</i><b>_</b><i>id</i> of <b>-</b> is speci-
              fied, the program reads  queue  IDs  from  standard
              input.  For  example, to delete all mail from or to
              <b>user@example.com</b>:

              mailq | tail +2 | awk  'BEGIN { RS = "" } \
                  / user@example\.com$/ { print $1 } \
              ' | tr -d '*!' | postsuper -d -

              Specify <b>-d ALL</b> to remove all messages; for example,
              specify  <b>-d  ALL  deferred</b>  to  delete  mail in the
              <b>deferred</b> queue.  As a safety measure, the word  <b>ALL</b>
              must be specified in upper case.

              Warning:  Postfix queue IDs are reused.  There is a
              very small possibility that postsuper  deletes  the
              wrong  message  file  when it is executed while the
              Postfix mail system is delivering mail.

              The scenario is as follows:

              1)     The Postfix queue manager deletes  the  mes-
                     sage  that  <b>postsuper</b>  is  asked  to delete,
                     because Postfix is finished with the message
                     (it  is  delivered, or it is returned to the
                     sender).

              2)     New mail arrives, and  the  new  message  is
                     given  the same queue ID as the message that
                     <b>postsuper</b> is supposed to delete.  The proba-
                     bility  for  reusing  a  deleted queue ID is
                     about 1 in 2**15 (the  number  of  different
                     microsecond values that the system clock can
                     distinguish within a second).

              3)     <b>postsuper</b> deletes the new  message,  instead
                     of  the  old  message  that  it  should have
                     deleted.

       <b>-h</b> <i>queue</i><b>_</b><i>id</i>
              Put mail "on hold" so that no attempt  is  made  to
              deliver  it.  Move one message with the named queue
              ID from the named mail queue(s) (default: <b>incoming</b>,
              <b>active</b>  and  <b>deferred</b>)  to  the  <b>hold</b>  queue.  If a
              <i>queue</i><b>_</b><i>id</i> of <b>-</b> is specified, the program reads queue
              IDs from standard input.

              Specify  <b>-h  ALL</b> to hold all messages; for example,
              specify  <b>-h  ALL  deferred</b>  to  hold  mail  in  the
              <b>deferred</b>  queue.  As a safety measure, the word <b>ALL</b>
              must be specified in upper case.

              Note: while mail is "on hold" it  will  not  expire
              when  its  time  in  the  queue  exceeds  the <b><a href="postconf.5.html#maximal_queue_lifetime">maxi</a>-</b>
              <b><a href="postconf.5.html#maximal_queue_lifetime">mal_queue_lifetime</a></b>  or  <b><a href="postconf.5.html#bounce_queue_lifetime">bounce_queue_lifetime</a></b>  set-
              ting.  It becomes subject to expiration after it is
              released from "hold".

       <b>-H</b> <i>queue</i><b>_</b><i>id</i>
              Release mail that was put "on hold".  Move one mes-
              sage  with  the  named queue ID from the named mail
              queue(s) (default: <b>hold</b>) to the <b>deferred</b> queue.  If
              a  <i>queue</i><b>_</b><i>id</i>  of  <b>-</b>  is specified, the program reads
              queue IDs from standard input.

              Specify <b>-H ALL</b> to release  all  mail  that  is  "on
              hold".   As  a safety measure, the word <b>ALL</b> must be
              specified in upper case.

       <b>-p</b>     Purge old temporary files that are left over  after
              system or software crashes.

       <b>-r</b> <i>queue</i><b>_</b><i>id</i>
              Requeue  the  message  with the named queue ID from
              the named mail queue(s) (default:  <b>hold</b>,  <b>incoming</b>,
              <b>active</b>  and  <b>deferred</b>).   To  requeue multiple mes-
              sages, specify multiple  <b>-r</b>  command-line  options.
              Alternatively, if a <i>queue</i><b>_</b><i>id</i> of <b>-</b> is specified, the
              program reads queue IDs from standard input.

              Specify <b>-r ALL</b> to requeue all messages. As a safety
              measure,  the  word  <b>ALL</b> must be specified in upper
              case.

              A requeued message is moved to the <b>maildrop</b>  queue,
              from  where  it is copied by the pickup daemon to a
              new file whose name is guaranteed to match the  new
              queue file inode number. The new queue file is sub-
              jected again to mail address rewriting and  substi-
              tution. This is useful when rewriting rules or vir-
              tual mappings have changed.

              Warning: Postfix queue IDs are reused.  There is  a
              very  small possibility that <b>postsuper</b> requeues the
              wrong message file when it is  executed  while  the
              Postfix  mail system is running, but no harm should
              be done.

       <b>-s</b>     Structure check and structure repair.  This  should
              be done once before Postfix startup.

              <b>o</b>      Rename  files  whose name does not match the
                     message file inode number. This operation is
                     necessary  after restoring a mail queue from
                     a different machine, or from backup media.

              <b>o</b>      Move queue files that are in the wrong place
                     in the file system hierarchy and remove sub-
                     directories that are no longer needed.  File
                     position  rearrangements are necessary after
                     a  change  in  the  <b><a href="postconf.5.html#hash_queue_names">hash_queue_names</a></b>  and/or
                     <b><a href="postconf.5.html#hash_queue_depth">hash_queue_depth</a></b> configuration parameters.

       <b>-v</b>     Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Mul-
              tiple <b>-v</b> options  make  the  software  increasingly
              verbose.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Problems  are reported to the standard error stream and to
       <b>syslogd</b>(8).

       <b>postsuper</b> reports the number of messages deleted with  <b>-d</b>,
       the number of messages requeued with <b>-r</b>, and the number of
       messages whose queue file name  was  fixed  with  <b>-s</b>.  The
       report is written to the standard error stream and to <b>sys-</b>
       <b>logd</b>(8).

<b>ENVIRONMENT</b>
       MAIL_CONFIG
              Directory with the <b>main.cf</b> file.

<b>BUGS</b>
       Mail that is not sanitized by Postfix (i.e.  mail  in  the
       <b>maildrop</b> queue) cannot be placed "on hold".

<b>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS</b>
