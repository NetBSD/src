LDAP_TABLE(5)                                                    LDAP_TABLE(5)

<b>NAME</b>
       ldap_table - Postfix LDAP client configuration

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>postmap -q "</b><i>string</i><b>" <a href="ldap_table.5.html">ldap</a>:/etc/postfix/filename</b>

       <b>postmap -q - <a href="ldap_table.5.html">ldap</a>:/etc/postfix/</b><i>filename</i> &lt;<i>inputfile</i>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  Postfix  mail system uses optional tables for address
       rewriting or mail routing. These tables are usually in <b>dbm</b>
       or <b>db</b> format.

       Alternatively,  lookup  tables  can  be  specified as LDAP
       databases.

       In order to use LDAP lookups, define an LDAP source  as  a
       lookup table in <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>, for example:

           <a href="postconf.5.html#alias_maps">alias_maps</a> = <a href="ldap_table.5.html">ldap</a>:/etc/postfix/ldap-aliases.cf

       The  file /etc/postfix/ldap-aliases.cf has the same format
       as the Postfix <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a> file, and can specify  the  parame-
       ters  described  below.  An example is given at the end of
       this manual.

       This configuration method is available with  Postfix  ver-
       sion  2.1  and later.  See the section "BACKWARDS COMPATI-
       BILITY" below for older Postfix versions.

       For details about LDAP SSL and STARTTLS, see  the  section
       on SSL and STARTTLS below.

<b>BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY</b>
       For  backwards  compatibility with Postfix version 2.0 and
       earlier, LDAP parameters can also be defined  in  <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>.
       Specify  as  LDAP  source a name that doesn't begin with a
       slash or a dot.  The LDAP parameters will then be accessi-
       ble as the name you've given the source in its definition,
       an underscore, and the name of the parameter.   For  exam-
       ple,  if  the  map  is specified as "<a href="ldap_table.5.html">ldap</a>:<i>ldapsource</i>", the
       "server_host" parameter below would be defined in  <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>
       as "<i>ldapsource</i>_server_host".

       Note:  with  this form, the passwords for the LDAP sources
       are written in <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>, which is normally  world-readable.
       Support  for this form will be removed in a future Postfix
       version.

       Postfix 2.2 has enhanced query interfaces  for  MySQL  and
       PostgreSQL.   These  include features that were previously
       available only in the Postfix LDAP client. This work  also
       created an opportunity for improvements in the LDAP inter-
       face. The primary compatibility issue is that  <b>result_fil-</b>
       <b>ter</b> (a name that has caused some confusion as to its mean-
       ing in the past) has been renamed to  <b>result_format</b>.   For
       backwards  compatibility  with  the  pre  2.2 LDAP client,
       <b>result_filter</b> can for now be used instead  of  <b>result_for-</b>
       <b>mat</b>,  when  the latter parameter is not also set.  The new
       name better reflects the function of the  parameter.  This
       compatibility   interface  may  be  removed  in  a  future
       release.

<b>LIST MEMBERSHIP</b>
       When using  LDAP  to  store  lists  such  as  $<a href="postconf.5.html#mynetworks">mynetworks</a>,
       $<a href="postconf.5.html#mydestination">mydestination</a>,   $<a href="postconf.5.html#relay_domains">relay_domains</a>,   $<a href="postconf.5.html#local_recipient_maps">local_recipient_maps</a>,
       etc., it is important to understand that  the  table  must
       store each list member as a separate key. The table lookup
       verifies the *existence* of the key.  See  "Postfix  lists
       versus  tables" in the <a href="DATABASE_README.html">DATABASE_README</a> document for a dis-
       cussion.

       Do NOT create tables that return the full list of  domains
       in  $<a href="postconf.5.html#mydestination">mydestination</a> or $<a href="postconf.5.html#relay_domains">relay_domains</a> etc., or IP addresses
       in $<a href="postconf.5.html#mynetworks">mynetworks</a>.

       DO create tables with each matching item as a key and with
       an arbitrary value. With LDAP databases it is not uncommon
       to return the key itself.

       For example, NEVER do this in a map  defining  $<a href="postconf.5.html#mydestination">mydestina</a>-
       <a href="postconf.5.html#mydestination">tion</a>:

           query_filter = domain=*
           result_attribute = domain

       Do this instead:

           query_filter = domain=%s
           result_attribute = domain

<b>GENERAL LDAP PARAMETERS</b>
       In  the  text below, default values are given in parenthe-
       ses.  Note: don't use quotes in these variables; at least,
       not  until  the  Postfix configuration routines understand
       how to deal with quoted strings.

       <b>server_host (default: localhost)</b>
              The name of the host running the LDAP server,  e.g.

                  server_host = ldap.example.com

              Depending  on the LDAP client library you're using,
              it should be possible to specify  multiple  servers
              here,  with the library trying them in order should
              the first one fail. It should also be  possible  to
              give  each  server  in  the  list  a different port
              (overriding <b>server_port</b> below), by naming them like

                  server_host = ldap.example.com:1444

              With OpenLDAP, a (list of) LDAP URLs can be used to
              specify both the hostname(s) and the port(s):

                  server_host = <a href="ldap_table.5.html">ldap</a>://ldap.example.com:1444
                              <a href="ldap_table.5.html">ldap</a>://ldap2.example.com:1444

              All LDAP URLs accepted by the OpenLDAP library  are
              supported,  including  connections over UNIX domain
              sockets, and LDAP SSL (the last one  provided  that
              OpenLDAP was compiled with support for SSL):

                  server_host = ldapi://%2Fsome%2Fpath
                              ldaps://ldap.example.com:636

       <b>server_port (default: 389)</b>
              The port the LDAP server listens on, e.g.

                  server_port = 778

       <b>timeout (default: 10 seconds)</b>
              The number of seconds a search can take before tim-
              ing out, e.g.

                  timeout = 5

       <b>search_base (No default; you must configure this)</b>
              The <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2253.html">RFC2253</a> base DN at which to conduct the search,
              e.g.

                  search_base = dc=your, dc=com

              With  Postfix 2.2 and later this parameter supports
              the following '%' expansions:

              <b>%%</b>     This is replaced by a literal '%' character.

              <b>%s</b>     This is replaced by the input key.  <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2253.html">RFC 2253</a>
                     quoting is used to make sure that the  input
                     key  does not add unexpected metacharacters.

              <b>%u</b>     When the input key is an address of the form
                     user@domain,  <b>%u</b>  is  replaced  by  the (<a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2253.html">RFC</a>
                     <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2253.html">2253</a>) quoted  local  part  of  the  address.
                     Otherwise,  <b>%u</b>  is  replaced  by  the entire
                     search string.  If the localpart  is  empty,
                     the  search  is  suppressed  and  returns no
                     results.

              <b>%d</b>     When the input key is an address of the form
                     user@domain,  <b>%d</b>  is  replaced  by  the (<a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2253.html">RFC</a>
                     <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2253.html">2253</a>) quoted domain  part  of  the  address.
                     Otherwise,  the  search  is  suppressed  and
                     returns no results.

              <b>%[SUD]</b> For the <b>search_base</b>  parameter,  the  upper-
                     case  equivalents  of  the  above expansions
                     behave  identically  to   their   lower-case
                     counter-parts. With the <b>result_format</b> param-
                     eter (previously  called  <b>result_filter</b>  see
                     the  COMPATIBILITY  section and below), they
                     expand to the  corresponding  components  of
                     input key rather than the result value.

              <b>%[1-9]</b> The  patterns %1, %2, ... %9 are replaced by
                     the corresponding most significant component
                     of  the input key's domain. If the input key
                     is <i>user@mail.example.com</i>, then %1 is <b>com</b>, %2
                     is  <b>example</b> and %3 is <b>mail</b>. If the input key
                     is  unqualified  or  does  not  have  enough
                     domain  components to satisfy all the speci-
                     fied patterns, the search is suppressed  and
                     returns no results.

       <b>query_filter (default: mailacceptinggeneralid=%s)</b>
              The  <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2254.html">RFC2254</a>  filter  used to search the directory,
              where <b>%s</b> is a substitute for the address Postfix is
              trying to resolve, e.g.

                  query_filter = (&amp;(mail=%s)(paid_up=true))

              This  parameter  supports  the following '%' expan-
              sions:

              <b>%%</b>     This is replaced by a literal '%' character.
                     (Postfix 2.2 and later).

              <b>%s</b>     This is replaced by the input key.  <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2254.html">RFC 2254</a>
                     quoting is used to make sure that the  input
                     key  does not add unexpected metacharacters.

              <b>%u</b>     When the input key is an address of the form
                     user@domain,  <b>%u</b>  is  replaced  by  the (<a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2254.html">RFC</a>
                     <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2254.html">2254</a>) quoted  local  part  of  the  address.
                     Otherwise,  <b>%u</b>  is  replaced  by  the entire
                     search string.  If the localpart  is  empty,
                     the  search  is  suppressed  and  returns no
                     results.

              <b>%d</b>     When the input key is an address of the form
                     user@domain,  <b>%d</b>  is  replaced  by  the (<a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2254.html">RFC</a>
                     <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2254.html">2254</a>) quoted domain  part  of  the  address.
                     Otherwise,  the  search  is  suppressed  and
                     returns no results.

              <b>%[SUD]</b> The  upper-case  equivalents  of  the  above
                     expansions behave in the <b>query_filter</b> param-
                     eter   identically   to   their   lower-case
                     counter-parts. With the <b>result_format</b> param-
                     eter (previously  called  <b>result_filter</b>  see
                     the  COMPATIBILITY  section and below), they
                     expand to the  corresponding  components  of
                     input key rather than the result value.

                     The  above  %S,  %U  and  %D  expansions are
                     available with Postfix 2.2 and later.

              <b>%[1-9]</b> The patterns %1, %2, ... %9 are replaced  by
                     the corresponding most significant component
                     of the input key's domain. If the input  key
                     is <i>user@mail.example.com</i>, then %1 is <b>com</b>, %2
                     is <b>example</b> and %3 is <b>mail</b>. If the input  key
                     is  unqualified  or  does  not  have  enough
                     domain components to satisfy all the  speci-
                     fied  patterns, the search is suppressed and
                     returns no results.

                     The above %1, ..., %9 expansions are  avail-
                     able with Postfix 2.2 and later.

              The  "domain"  parameter described below limits the
              input keys to addresses in matching  domains.  When
              the  "domain"  parameter is non-empty, LDAP queries
              for unqualified  addresses  or  addresses  in  non-
              matching  domains  are  suppressed  and  return  no
              results.

              NOTE: DO NOT put  quotes  around  the  <b>query_filter</b>
              parameter.

       <b>result_format (default: %s</b>)
              Called  <b>result_filter</b>  in Postfix releases prior to
              2.2.  Format template applied to result attributes.
              Most  commonly  used to append (or prepend) text to
              the result. This parameter supports  the  following
              '%' expansions:

              <b>%%</b>     This is replaced by a literal '%' character.
                     (Postfix 2.2 and later).

              <b>%s</b>     This is replaced by the value of the  result
                     attribute.   When  result  is  empty  it  is
                     skipped.

              <b>%u</b>     When  the  result  attribute  value  is   an
                     address  of  the  form  user@domain,  <b>%u</b>  is
                     replaced by the local part of  the  address.
                     When the result has an empty localpart it is
                     skipped.

              <b>%d</b>     When a result attribute value is an  address
                     of  the  form user@domain, <b>%d</b> is replaced by
                     the domain part of the attribute value. When
                     the result is unqualified it is skipped.

              <b>%[SUD1-9]</b>
                     The  upper-case and decimal digit expansions
                     interpolate  the  parts  of  the  input  key
                     rather  than  the  result. Their behavior is
                     identical to that described with  <b>query_fil-</b>
                     <b>ter</b>,  and  in  fact because the input key is
                     known in advance, lookups whose key does not
                     contain all the information specified in the
                     result template are suppressed and return no
                     results.

                     The  above %S, %U, %D and %1, ..., %9 expan-
                     sions are available  with  Postfix  2.2  and
                     later.

              For  example,  using  "result_format  =  <a href="smtp.8.html">smtp</a>:[%s]"
              allows one to use a mailHost attribute as the basis
              of  a <a href="transport.5.html">transport(5)</a> table. After applying the result
              format, multiple values are concatenated  as  comma
              separated    strings.   The   expansion_limit   and
              size_limit parameters explained below allow one  to
              restrict  the number of values in the result, which
              is especially useful for maps that should return  a
              single value.

              The  default value <b>%s</b> specifies that each attribute
              value should be used as is.

              This parameter was called <b>result_filter</b> in  Postfix
              releases  prior  to  2.2.  If no "result_format" is
              specified, the value  of  "result_filter"  will  be
              used instead before resorting to the default value.
              This provides compatibility with old  configuration
              files.

              NOTE: DO NOT put quotes around the result format!

       <b>domain (default: no domain list)</b>
              This  is a list of domain names, paths to files, or
              dictionaries. When specified, only fully  qualified
              search  keys  with  a  *non-empty*  localpart and a
              matching domain are  eligible  for  lookup:  'user'
              lookups,  bare domain lookups and "@domain" lookups
              are not performed. This  can  significantly  reduce
              the query load on the LDAP server.

                  domain = postfix.org, hash:/etc/postfix/searchdomains

              It  is  best  not  to use LDAP to store the domains
              eligible for LDAP lookups.

              NOTE: DO NOT define  this  parameter  for  <a href="local.8.html">local(8)</a>
              aliases.

              This feature is available in Postfix 1.0 and later.

       <b>result_attribute (default: maildrop)</b>
              The attribute(s) Postfix will read from any  direc-
              tory entries returned by the lookup, to be resolved
              to an email address.

                  result_attribute = mailbox, maildrop

       <b>special_result_attribute (default: empty)</b>
              The attribute(s) of directory entries that can con-
              tain  DNs or URLs. If found, a recursive subsequent
              search is done using their values.

                  special_result_attribute = memberdn

              DN recursion retrieves the  same  result_attributes
              as the main query, including the special attributes
              for further  recursion.  URI  processing  retrieves
              only  those attributes that are included in the URI
              definition    and    are    *also*    listed     in
              "result_attribute".  If  the  URI  lists any of the
              map's special result  attributes,  these  are  also
              retrieved and used recursively.

       <b>terminal_result_attribute (default: empty)</b>
              When  one  or  more  terminal result attributes are
              found in an LDAP entry, all other result attributes
              are ignored and only the terminal result attributes
              are returned. This is useful for delegating  expan-
              sion  of  group  members  to  a particular host, by
              using an optional "maildrop" attribute on  selected
              groups to route the group to a specific host, where
              the group is expanded,  possibly  via  mailing-list
              manager or other special processing.

                  terminal_result_attribute = maildrop

              This  feature  is  available  with  Postfix  2.4 or
              later.

       <b>leaf_result_attribute (default: empty)</b>
              When one or  more  special  result  attributes  are
              found  in  a  non-terminal  (see above) LDAP entry,
              leaf result attributes are excluded from the expan-
              sion  of  that entry. This is useful when expanding
              groups and the desired mail address attribute(s) of
              the member objects obtained via DN or URI recursion
              are also present  in  the  group  object.  To  only
              return  the  attribute values from the leaf objects
              and not the containing group, add the attribute  to
              the   leaf_result_attribute   list,   and  not  the
              result_attribute list, which  is  always  expanded.
              Note,  the  default  value of "result_attribute" is
              not empty, you may want to set it explicitly  empty
              when  using  "leaf_result_attribute"  to expand the
              group to a list of member DN addresses.  If  groups
              have  both member DN references AND attributes that
              hold multiple string valued rfc822 addresses,  then
              the  string  attributes  go  in "result_attribute".
              The attributes that represent the  email  addresses
              of  objects referenced via a DN (or LDAP URI) go in
              "leaf_result_attribute".

                  result_attribute = memberaddr
                  special_result_attribute = memberdn
                  terminal_result_attribute = maildrop
                  leaf_result_attribute = mail

              This feature  is  available  with  Postfix  2.4  or
              later.

       <b>scope (default: sub)</b>
              The  LDAP  search  scope: <b>sub</b>, <b>base</b>, or <b>one</b>.  These
              translate into LDAP_SCOPE_SUBTREE, LDAP_SCOPE_BASE,
              and LDAP_SCOPE_ONELEVEL.

       <b>bind (default: yes)</b>
              Whether  or  not  to bind to the LDAP server. Newer
              LDAP implementations don't require clients to bind,
              which saves time. Example:

                  bind = no

              If  you do need to bind, you might consider config-
              uring Postfix to connect to the local machine on  a
              port  that's  an SSL tunnel to your LDAP server. If
              your LDAP server doesn't natively support SSL,  put
              a tunnel (wrapper, proxy, whatever you want to call
              it) on that system too.  This  should  prevent  the
              password  from traversing the network in the clear.

       <b>bind_dn (default: empty)</b>
              If you do have to bind, do  it  with  this  distin-
              guished name. Example:

                  bind_dn = uid=postfix, dc=your, dc=com

       <b>bind_pw (default: empty)</b>
              The  password  for the distinguished name above. If
              you have to use this, you probably want to make the
              map configuration file readable only by the Postfix
              user. When using the obsolete <a href="ldap_table.5.html">ldap</a>:ldapsource  syn-
              tax, with map parameters in <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>, it is not pos-
              sible to securely store the bind password. This  is
              because <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a> needs to be world readable to allow
              local accounts to submit mail via the sendmail com-
              mand. Example:

                  bind_pw = postfixpw

       <b>cache (IGNORED with a warning)</b>

       <b>cache_expiry (IGNORED with a warning)</b>

       <b>cache_size (IGNORED with a warning)</b>
              The  above  parameters  are  NO LONGER SUPPORTED by
              Postfix.   Cache  support  has  been  dropped  from
              OpenLDAP as of release 2.1.13.

       <b>recursion_limit (default: 1000)</b>
              A  limit on the nesting depth of DN and URL special
              result attribute evaluation. The limit  must  be  a
              non-zero positive number.

       <b>expansion_limit (default: 0)</b>
              A  limit  on  the  total  number of result elements
              returned (as a comma separated list)  by  a  lookup
              against  the  map.   A setting of zero disables the
              limit. Lookups fail with a temporary error  if  the
              limit  is exceeded.  Setting the limit to 1 ensures
              that lookups do not return multiple values.

       <b>size_limit (default: $expansion_limit)</b>
              A limit on the number of LDAP entries  returned  by
              any  single  LDAP  search  performed as part of the
              lookup. A setting of 0 disables the limit.   Expan-
              sion  of DN and URL references involves nested LDAP
              queries, each of which is separately  subjected  to
              this limit.

              Note:  even a single LDAP entry can generate multi-
              ple lookup results, via multiple result  attributes
              and/or  multi-valued  result attributes. This limit
              caps the per search  resource  utilization  on  the
              LDAP  server,  not  the  final  multiplicity of the
              lookup result. It is analogous to the  "-z"  option
              of "ldapsearch".

       <b>dereference (default: 0)</b>
              When  to  dereference LDAP aliases. (Note that this
              has nothing do with Postfix aliases.) The permitted
              values  are  those  legal  for the OpenLDAP/UM LDAP
              implementations:

              0      never

              1      when searching

              2      when locating the base object for the search

              3      always

              See ldap.h or the ldap_open(3) or ldapsearch(1) man
              pages for more information. And if you're using  an
              LDAP package that has other possible values, please
              bring  it  to  the  attention   of   the   postfix-
              users@postfix.org mailing list.

       <b>chase_referrals (default: 0)</b>
              Sets  (or clears) LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS (requires LDAP
              version 3 support).

       <b>version (default: 2)</b>
              Specifies the LDAP protocol version to use.

       <b>debuglevel (default: 0)</b>
              What level to set for  debugging  in  the  OpenLDAP
              libraries.

<b>LDAP SSL AND STARTTLS PARAMETERS</b>
       If  you're  using the OpenLDAP libraries compiled with SSL
       support, Postfix can connect to LDAP SSL servers  and  can
       issue the STARTTLS command.

       LDAP  SSL service can be requested by using a LDAP SSL URL
       in the server_host parameter:

           server_host = ldaps://ldap.example.com:636

       STARTTLS can be turned on with the start_tls parameter:

           start_tls = yes

       Both forms require LDAP protocol version 3, which  has  to
       be set explicitly with:

           version = 3

       If any of the Postfix programs querying the map is config-
       ured in <a href="master.5.html">master.cf</a> to run chrooted,  all  the  certificates
       and keys involved have to be copied to the chroot jail. Of
       course, the private keys should only be  readable  by  the
       user "postfix".

       The  following  parameters  are  relevant  to LDAP SSL and
       STARTTLS:

       <b>start_tls (default: no)</b>
              Whether or not to issue STARTTLS upon connection to
              the  server.  Don't set this with LDAP SSL (the SSL
              session is setup automatically when the TCP connec-
              tion is opened).

       <b>tls_ca_cert_dir   (No   default;   set   either   this  or</b>
       <b>tls_ca_cert_file)</b>
              Directory  containing  X509  Certificate  Authority
              certificates in PEM format which are to  be  recog-
              nized  by  the  client  in SSL/TLS connections. The
              files each contain one CA certificate.   The  files
              are  looked  up  by the CA subject name hash value,
              which must hence be available. If more than one  CA
              certificate  with  the  same name hash value exist,
              the extension must be different  (e.g.  9d66eef0.0,
              9d66eef0.1  etc).  The  search  is performed in the
              ordering of the  extension  number,  regardless  of
              other  properties  of  the  certificates.  Use  the
              c_rehash utility (from the OpenSSL distribution) to
              create the necessary links.

       <b>tls_ca_cert_file   (No   default;   set   either  this  or</b>
       <b>tls_ca_cert_dir)</b>
              File containing the X509 Certificate Authority cer-
              tificates in PEM format which are to be  recognized
              by  the client in SSL/TLS connections. This setting
              takes precedence over tls_ca_cert_dir.

       <b>tls_cert (No default; you must set this)</b>
              File containing client's  X509  certificate  to  be
              used by the client in SSL/ TLS connections.

       <b>tls_key (No default; you must set this)</b>
              File  containing  the  private key corresponding to
              the above tls_cert.

       <b>tls_require_cert (default: no)</b>
              Whether or not to request server's X509 certificate
              and  check  its  validity when establishing SSL/TLS
              connections.

       <b>tls_random_file (No default)</b>
              Path of a file to  obtain  random  bits  from  when
              /dev/[u]random  is not available, to be used by the
              client in SSL/TLS connections.

       <b>tls_cipher_suite (No default)</b>
              Cipher suite to use in SSL/TLS negotiations.

<b>EXAMPLE</b>
       Here's a basic example for using LDAP to look up  <a href="local.8.html">local(8)</a>
       aliases.  Assume that in <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>, you have:

           <a href="postconf.5.html#alias_maps">alias_maps</a> = hash:/etc/aliases,
                   <a href="ldap_table.5.html">ldap</a>:/etc/postfix/ldap-aliases.cf

       and in <a href="ldap_table.5.html">ldap</a>:/etc/postfix/ldap-aliases.cf you have:

           server_host = ldap.example.com
           search_base = dc=example, dc=com

       Upon  receiving  mail  for a local address "ldapuser" that
       isn't found in the  /etc/aliases  database,  Postfix  will
       search the LDAP server listening at port 389 on ldap.exam-
       ple.com.  It will bind anonymously, search for any  direc-
       tory  entries  whose  mailacceptinggeneralid  attribute is
       "ldapuser", read the "maildrop" attributes of those found,
       and build a list of their maildrops, which will be treated
       as <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc822.html">RFC822</a> addresses to which the message  will  be  deliv-
       ered.
