ACCESS(5)                                               ACCESS(5)

<b>NAME</b>
       access - format of Postfix access table

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>postmap /etc/postfix/access</b>

       <b>postmap -q "</b><i>string</i><b>" /etc/postfix/access</b>

       <b>postmap -q - /etc/postfix/access</b> &lt;<i>inputfile</i>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  optional <b>access</b> table directs the Postfix SMTP server
       to selectively  reject  or  accept  mail.  Access  can  be
       allowed  or  denied for specific host names, domain names,
       networks, host network addresses or mail addresses.

       For an example, see the EXAMPLE section at the end of this
       manual page.

       Normally,  the  <b>access</b>  table  is specified as a text file
       that serves as  input  to  the  <a href="postmap.1.html"><b>postmap</b>(1)</a>  command.   The
       result,  an  indexed file in <b>dbm</b> or <b>db</b> format, is used for
       fast searching by the mail  system.  Execute  the  command
       <b>postmap   /etc/postfix/access</b>  in  order  to  rebuild  the
       indexed file after changing the access table.

       When the table is provided via other means  such  as  NIS,
       LDAP  or  SQL,  the  same lookups are done as for ordinary
       indexed files.

       Alternatively, the table can be  provided  as  a  regular-
       expression map where patterns are given as regular expres-
       sions, or lookups can be directed to TCP-based server.  In
       that  case,  the  lookups are done in a slightly different
       way as described below under "REGULAR  EXPRESSION  TABLES"
       and "TCP-BASED TABLES".

<b>TABLE FORMAT</b>
       The input format for the <a href="postmap.1.html"><b>postmap</b>(1)</a> command is as follows:

       <i>pattern action</i>
              When <i>pattern</i> matches a mail address, domain or host
              address, perform the corresponding <i>action</i>.

       blank lines and comments
              Empty  lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored,
              as are lines whose first  non-whitespace  character
              is a `#'.

       multi-line text
              A  logical  line starts with non-whitespace text. A
              line that starts with whitespace continues a  logi-
              cal line.

<b>EMAIL ADDRESS PATTERNS</b>
       With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from
       networked tables such as NIS, LDAP or  SQL,  patterns  are
       tried in the order as listed below:

       <i>user</i>@<i>domain</i>
              Matches the specified mail address.

       <i>domain.tld</i>
              Matches  <i>domain.tld</i>  as the domain part of an email
              address.

              The pattern <i>domain.tld</i> also matches subdomains, but
              only when the string <b>smtpd_access_maps</b> is listed in
              the Postfix  <b><a href="postconf.5.html#parent_domain_matches_subdomains">parent_domain_matches_subdomains</a></b>  con-
              figuration  setting  (note that this is the default
              for some versions of Postfix).  Otherwise,  specify
              <i>.domain.tld</i>  (note  the  initial  dot)  in order to
              match subdomains.

       <i>user</i>@  Matches all mail addresses with the specified  user
              part.

       Note:  lookup  of  the null sender address is not possible
       with some types of lookup table. By default, Postfix  uses
       &lt;&gt;  as  the  lookup  key  for such addresses. The value is
       specified with the <b><a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_null_access_lookup_key">smtpd_null_access_lookup_key</a></b>  parameter
       in the Postfix <b>main.cf</b> file.

<b>EMAIL ADDRESS EXTENSION</b>
       When a mail address localpart contains the optional recip-
       ient delimiter (e.g., <i>user+foo</i>@<i>domain</i>), the  lookup  order
       becomes:  <i>user+foo</i>@<i>domain</i>, <i>user</i>@<i>domain</i>, <i>domain</i>, <i>user+foo</i>@,
       and <i>user</i>@.

<b>HOST NAME/ADDRESS PATTERNS</b>
       With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from
       networked  tables  such as NIS, LDAP or SQL, the following
       lookup patterns are examined in the order as listed:

       <i>domain.tld</i>
              Matches <i>domain.tld</i>.

              The pattern <i>domain.tld</i> also matches subdomains, but
              only when the string <b>smtpd_access_maps</b> is listed in
              the Postfix  <b><a href="postconf.5.html#parent_domain_matches_subdomains">parent_domain_matches_subdomains</a></b>  con-
              figuration setting.  Otherwise, specify <i>.domain.tld</i>
              (note the initial dot) in  order  to  match  subdo-
              mains.

       <i>net.work.addr.ess</i>

       <i>net.work.addr</i>

       <i>net.work</i>

       <i>net</i>    Matches  any host address in the specified network.
              A network address is a  sequence  of  one  or  more
              octets separated by ".".

              NOTE:  use  the  <b>cidr</b>  lookup table type to specify
              network/netmask  patterns.  See  <a href="cidr_table.5.html">cidr_table(5)</a>  for
              details.

<b>ACCEPT ACTIONS</b>
       <b>OK</b>     Accept the address etc. that matches the pattern.

       <i>all-numerical</i>
              An all-numerical result is treated as OK. This for-
              mat is generated by address-based relay  authoriza-
              tion schemes.

<b>REJECT ACTIONS</b>
       <b>4</b><i>NN text</i>

       <b>5</b><i>NN text</i>
              Reject  the  address etc. that matches the pattern,
              and respond with the numerical three-digit code and
              text.  <b>4</b><i>NN</i> means "try again later", while <b>5</b><i>NN</i> means
              "do not try again".

       <b>REJECT</b> <i>optional text...</i>
              Reject the address etc. that matches  the  pattern.
              Reply  with  <i>$reject</i><b>_</b><i>code optional text...</i> when the
              optional text is specified, otherwise reply with  a
              generic error response message.

       <b>DEFER_IF_REJECT</b> <i>optional text...</i>
              Defer  the  request if some later restriction would
              result in a REJECT action. Reply with "<b>450</b> <i>optional</i>
              <i>text...</i> when the optional text is specified, other-
              wise reply with a generic error response message.

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       <b>DEFER_IF_PERMIT</b> <i>optional text...</i>
              Defer  the  request if some later restriction would
              result in a an explicit or implicit PERMIT  action.
              Reply  with "<b>450</b> <i>optional text...</i> when the optional
              text is specified, otherwise reply with  a  generic
              error response message.

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>OTHER ACTIONS</b>
       <i>restriction...</i>
              Apply the named UCE restriction(s) (<b>permit</b>, <b>reject</b>,
              <b><a href="postconf.5.html#reject_unauth_destination">reject_unauth_destination</a></b>, and so on).

       <b>DISCARD</b> <i>optional text...</i>
              Claim  successful delivery and silently discard the
              message.  Log the optional text if specified,  oth-
              erwise log a generic message.

              Note:  this action currently affects all recipients
              of the message.

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

       <b>DUNNO</b>  Pretend  that  the  lookup  key was not found. This
              prevents Postfix  from  trying  substrings  of  the
              lookup  key (such as a subdomain name, or a network
              address subnetwork).

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

       <b>FILTER</b> <i>transport:destination</i>
              After  the  message is queued, send the entire mes-
              sage through the specified external content filter.
              The  <i>transport:destination</i>  syntax  is described in
              the <a href="transport.5.html">transport(5)</a>  manual  page.   More  information
              about  external  content  filters is in the Postfix
              <a href="FILTER_README.html">FILTER_README</a> file.

              Note:  this  action  overrides  the  <b>main.cf   <a href="postconf.5.html#content_filter">con</a>-</b>
              <b><a href="postconf.5.html#content_filter">tent_filter</a></b>  setting,  and  currently  affects  all
              recipients of the message.

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

       <b>HOLD</b> <i>optional text...</i>
              Place  the message on the <b>hold</b> queue, where it will
              sit until someone either deletes it or releases  it
              for  delivery.  Log the optional text if specified,
              otherwise log a generic message.

              Mail that is placed on hold can  be  examined  with
              the  <a href="postcat.1.html"><b>postcat</b>(1)</a>  command,  and  can be destroyed or
              released with the <a href="postsuper.1.html"><b>postsuper</b>(1)</a> command.

              Note: this action currently affects all  recipients
              of the message.

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

       <b>PREPEND</b> <i>headername: headervalue</i>
              Prepend the specified message header  to  the  mes-
              sage.  When this action is used multiple times, the
              first prepended header appears  before  the  second
              etc. prepended header.

              Note:  this action does not support multi-line mes-
              sage headers.

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       <b>REDIRECT</b> <i>user@domain</i>
              After  the  message  is queued, send the message to
              the  specified  address  instead  of  the  intended
              recipient(s).

              Note:  this action overrides the FILTER action, and
              currently affects all recipients of the message.

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       <b>WARN</b> <i>optional text...</i>
              Log a warning with the optional text, together with
              client information and  if  available,  with  helo,
              sender, recipient and protocol information.

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

<b>REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES</b>
       This section describes how the table lookups  change  when
       the table is given in the form of regular expressions. For
       a description of regular expression lookup  table  syntax,
       see <a href="regexp_table.5.html"><b>regexp_table</b>(5)</a> or <a href="pcre_table.5.html"><b>pcre_table</b>(5)</a>.

       Each  pattern  is  a regular expression that is applied to
       the entire string being looked up. Depending on the appli-
       cation,  that  string  is  an  entire  client hostname, an
       entire client IP address, or an entire mail address. Thus,
       no  parent  domain  or  parent  network  search  is  done,
       <i>user@domain</i> mail addresses are not broken  up  into  their
       <i>user@</i> and <i>domain</i> constituent parts, nor is <i>user+foo</i> broken
       up into <i>user</i> and <i>foo</i>.

       Patterns are applied in the  order  as  specified  in  the
       table,  until  a  pattern is found that matches the search
       string.

       Actions are the same as with indexed  file  lookups,  with
       the  additional feature that parenthesized substrings from
       the pattern can be interpolated as <b>$1</b>, <b>$2</b> and so on.

<b>TCP-BASED TABLES</b>
       This section describes how the table lookups  change  when
       lookups are directed to a TCP-based server. For a descrip-
       tion  of  the  TCP  client/server  lookup  protocol,   see
       <b>tcp_table</b>(5).   This  feature  is not available in Postfix
       version 2.1.

       Each lookup operation uses the entire query  string  once.
       Depending  on  the  application,  that string is an entire
       client hostname, an entire client IP address, or an entire
       mail  address.   Thus,  no parent domain or parent network
       search is done, <i>user@domain</i> mail addresses are not  broken
       up  into  their <i>user@</i> and <i>domain</i> constituent parts, nor is
       <i>user+foo</i> broken up into <i>user</i> and <i>foo</i>.

       Actions are the same as with indexed file lookups.

<b>EXAMPLE</b>
       The following example uses an indexed file,  so  that  the
       order  of  table entries does not matter. The example per-
       mits access by the client at address 1.2.3.4  but  rejects
       all  other clients in 1.2.3.0/24. Instead of "<b>hash</b>" lookup
       tables, some systems use "<b>dbm</b>".  Use the command "<b>postconf</b>
       <b>-m</b>"  to  find  out  what lookup tables Postfix supports on
       your system.

       /etc/postfix/main.cf:
           <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_client_restrictions">smtpd_client_restrictions</a> =
               <a href="postconf.5.html#check_client_access">check_client_access</a> hash:/etc/postfix/access

       /etc/postfix/access:
           1.2.3   REJECT
           1.2.3.4 OK

       Execute the command "<b>postmap /etc/postfix/access</b>" after
       editing the file.

<b>BUGS</b>
       The table format does not understand quoting  conventions.
