SMTP-SINK(1)                                                      SMTP-SINK(1)

<b>NAME</b>
       smtp-sink - multi-threaded SMTP/LMTP test server

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>smtp-sink</b> [<i>options</i>] [<b>inet:</b>][<i>host</i>]:<i>port backlog</i>

       <b>smtp-sink</b> [<i>options</i>] <b>unix:</b><i>pathname backlog</i>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <b>smtp-sink</b> listens on the named host (or address) and port.
       It takes SMTP messages from the network  and  throws  them
       away.   The  purpose is to measure client performance, not
       protocol compliance.

       <b>smtp-sink</b> may also be  configured  to  capture  each  mail
       delivery  transaction  to  file.  Since disk latencies are
       large compared to network delays, this mode  of  operation
       can  reduce  the  maximal performance by several orders of
       magnitude.

       Connections can be accepted on IPv4 or IPv6 endpoints,  or
       on  UNIX-domain  sockets.   IPv4 and IPv6 are the default.
       This program is the complement of the <a href="smtp-source.1.html"><b>smtp-source</b>(1)</a>  pro-
       gram.

       Note:  this  is an unsupported test program. No attempt is
       made to maintain  compatibility  between  successive  ver-
       sions.

       Arguments:

       <b>-4</b>     Support  IPv4  only. This option has no effect when
              Postfix is built without IPv6 support.

       <b>-6</b>     Support IPv6 only. This  option  is  not  available
              when Postfix is built without IPv6 support.

       <b>-8</b>     Do not announce 8BITMIME support.

       <b>-a</b>     Do not announce SASL authentication support.

       <b>-A</b> <i>delay</i>
              Wait  <i>delay</i>  seconds after responding to DATA, then
              abort prematurely with a 550 reply status.  Do  not
              read  further  input  from  the  client; this is an
              attempt to block the client before  it  sends  ".".
              Specify a zero delay value to abort immediately.

       <b>-c</b>     Display  running counters that are updated whenever
              an SMTP session ends, a QUIT command  is  executed,
              or when "." is received.

       <b>-C</b>     Disable XCLIENT support.

       <b>-d</b> <i>dump-template</i>
              Dump each mail transaction to a single-message file
              whose name is created by  expanding  the  <i>dump-tem-</i>
              <i>plate</i> via strftime(3) and appending a pseudo-random
              hexadecimal number (example: "%Y%m%d%H/%M." expands
              into  "2006081203/05.809a62e3").   If  the template
              contains "/" characters,  missing  directories  are
              created  automatically.  The message dump format is
              described below.

              Note: this option keeps one capture file  open  for
              every mail transaction in progress.

       <b>-D</b> <i>dump-template</i>
              Append  mail  transactions  to a multi-message dump
              file whose name is created by expanding  the  <i>dump-</i>
              <i>template</i> via strftime(3).  If the template contains
              "/" characters,  missing  directories  are  created
              automatically.    The   message   dump   format  is
              described below.

              Note: this option keeps one capture file  open  for
              every mail transaction in progress.

       <b>-e</b>     Do not announce ESMTP support.

       <b>-E</b>     Do not announce ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES support.

       <b>-f</b> <i>command,command,...</i>
              Reject  the  specified  commands  with a hard (5xx)
              error code.  This option implies <b>-p</b>.

              Examples of commands are CONNECT, HELO, EHLO, LHLO,
              MAIL,  RCPT,  VRFY,  DATA, ., RSET, NOOP, and QUIT.
              Separate command names by white  space  or  commas,
              and  use  quotes  to  protect  white space from the
              shell. Command names are case-insensitive.

       <b>-F</b>     Disable XFORWARD support.

       <b>-h</b> <i>hostname</i>
              Use <i>hostname</i> in the  SMTP  greeting,  in  the  HELO
              response,  and  in  the  EHLO response. The default
              hostname is "smtp-sink".

       <b>-L</b>     Enable LMTP instead of SMTP.

       <b>-m</b> <i>count</i> (default: 256)
              An upper bound on the maximal number of  simultane-
              ous  connections  that  <b>smtp-sink</b> will handle. This
              prevents the  process  from  running  out  of  file
              descriptors. Excess connections will stay queued in
              the TCP/IP stack.

       <b>-n</b> <i>count</i>
              Terminate after <i>count</i> sessions. This is for testing
              purposes.

       <b>-p</b>     Do  not announce support for ESMTP command pipelin-
              ing.

       <b>-P</b>     Change the server greeting so that  it  appears  to
              come through a CISCO PIX system. Implies <b>-e</b>.

       <b>-q</b> <i>command,command,...</i>
              Disconnect  (without  replying) after receiving one
              of the specified commands.

              Examples of commands are CONNECT, HELO, EHLO, LHLO,
              MAIL,  RCPT,  VRFY,  DATA, ., RSET, NOOP, and QUIT.
              Separate command names by white  space  or  commas,
              and  use  quotes  to  protect  white space from the
              shell. Command names are case-insensitive.

       <b>-r</b> <i>command,command,...</i>
              Reject the specified commands  with  a  soft  (4xx)
              error code.  This option implies <b>-p</b>.

              Examples of commands are CONNECT, HELO, EHLO, LHLO,
              MAIL, RCPT, VRFY, DATA, ., RSET,  NOOP,  and  QUIT.
              Separate  command  names  by white space or commas,
              and use quotes to  protect  white  space  from  the
              shell. Command names are case-insensitive.

       <b>-R</b> <i>root-directory</i>
              Change  the process root directory to the specified
              location.  This option requires  super-user  privi-
              leges. See also the <b>-u</b> option.

       <b>-s</b> <i>command,command,...</i>
              Log the named commands to syslogd.

              Examples of commands are CONNECT, HELO, EHLO, LHLO,
              MAIL, RCPT, VRFY, DATA, ., RSET,  NOOP,  and  QUIT.
              Separate  command  names  by white space or commas,
              and use quotes to  protect  white  space  from  the
              shell. Command names are case-insensitive.

       <b>-S start-string</b>
              An  optional  string that is prepended to each mes-
              sage that is written to a dump file (see  the  dump
              file  format  description  below).  The following C
              escape  sequences  are  supported:  \a  (bell),  \b
              (backslace),  \f (formfeed), \n (newline), \r (car-
              riage return), \t (horizontal  tab),  \v  (vertical

<b>DUMP FILE FORMAT</b>
       Each dumped message contains a  sequence  of  text  lines,
       terminated  with  the  newline  character. The sequence of
       information is as follows:

       <b>o</b>      The optional string specified with the <b>-S</b> option.

       <b>o</b>      The  <b>smtp-sink</b>  generated  headers  as   documented
              below.

       <b>o</b>      The  message  header  and body as received from the
              SMTP client.

       <b>o</b>      An empty line.

       The format of the <b>smtp-sink</b> generated headers is  as  fol-
       lows:

       <b>X-Client-Addr:</b> <i>text</i>
              The client IP address without enclosing []. An IPv6
              address is prefixed with "ipv6:".  This  record  is
              always present.

       <b>X-Client-Proto:</b> <i>text</i>
              The  client  protocol:  SMTP,  ESMTP  or LMTP. This
              record is always present.

       <b>X-Helo-Args:</b> <i>text</i>
              The arguments of the  last  HELO  or  EHLO  command
              before  this mail delivery transaction. This record
              is present only if the client sent  a  recognizable
              HELO or EHLO command before the DATA command.

       <b>X-Mail-Args:</b> <i>text</i>
              The arguments of the MAIL command that started this
              mail delivery transaction. This record  is  present
              exactly once.

       <b>X-Rcpt-Args:</b> <i>text</i>
              The  arguments  of an RCPT command within this mail
              delivery transaction. There is one record for  each
              RCPT  command, and they are in the order as sent by
              the client.

       <b>Received:</b> <i>text</i>
              A message header for compatibility with  mail  pro-
              cessing  software. This three-line header marks the
              end of the headers provided by  <b>smtp-sink</b>,  and  is
              formatted as follows:

              <b>from</b> <i>helo</i> <b>([</b><i>addr</i><b>])</b>
                     The HELO or EHLO command argument and client
                     IP address.  If the client did not send HELO
                     or  EHLO,  the  client  IP  address  is used
                     instead.

              <b>by</b> <i>host</i> <b>(smtp-sink) with</b> <i>proto</i> <b>id</b> <i>random</i><b>;</b>
                     The hostname specified with the  <b>-h</b>  option,
                     the   client  protocol  (see  <b>X-Client-Proto</b>
                     above), and the pseudo-random portion of the
                     per-message capture file name.

              <i>time-stamp</i>
                     A time stamp as defined in <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2822.html">RFC 2822</a>.
