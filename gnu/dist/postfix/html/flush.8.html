FLUSH(8)                                                 FLUSH(8)

<b>NAME</b>
       flush - Postfix fast flush server

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>flush</b> [generic Postfix daemon options]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  flush  server  maintains a record of deferred mail by
       destination.  This information is used to improve the per-
       formance of the SMTP <b>ETRN</b> request, and of its command-line
       equivalent, "<b>sendmail -qR</b>" or "<b>postqueue -f</b>".   This  pro-
       gram expects to be run from the <a href="master.8.html"><b>master</b>(8)</a> process manager.

       The record is implemented  as  a  per-destination  logfile
       with as contents the queue IDs of deferred mail. A logfile
       is  append-only,  and  is  truncated  when   delivery   is
       requested for the corresponding destination. A destination
       is the part on the right-hand side of the right-most <b>@</b>  in
       an email address.

       Per-destination  logfiles  of deferred mail are maintained
       only for eligible destinations. The list of eligible  des-
       tinations is specified with the <b><a href="postconf.5.html#fast_flush_domains">fast_flush_domains</a></b> config-
       uration parameter, which defaults to <b>$<a href="postconf.5.html#relay_domains">relay_domains</a></b>.

       This server implements the following requests:

       <b>add</b> <i>sitename queueid</i>
              Inform the fast flush server that the message  with
              the  specified queue ID is queued for the specified
              destination.

       <b>send</b> <i>sitename</i>
              Request delivery of mail that  is  queued  for  the
              specified destination.

       <b>refresh</b>
              Refresh  non-empty  per-destination  logfiles  that
              were not read in <b>$<a href="postconf.5.html#fast_flush_refresh_time">fast_flush_refresh_time</a></b> hours, by
              simulating send requests (see above) for the corre-
              sponding destinations.

              Delete empty per-destination logfiles that were not
              updated in <b>$<a href="postconf.5.html#fast_flush_purge_time">fast_flush_purge_time</a></b> days.

              This request completes in the background.

       <b>purge</b>  Do a <b>refresh</b> for all per-destination logfiles.

<b>SECURITY</b>
       The  fast  flush server is not security-sensitive. It does
       not talk to the network, and it does  not  talk  to  local
       users.   The  fast  flush server can run chrooted at fixed
       low privilege.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Problems and transactions are logged to <b>syslogd</b>(8).

<b>BUGS</b>
       Fast flush logfiles are  truncated  only  after  a  "send"
       request,  not  when mail is actually delivered, and there-
       fore can accumulate outdated or redundant data.  In  order
       to  maintain  sanity,  "refresh" must be executed periodi-
       cally. This can be automated with a suitable wakeup  timer
       setting in the <b>master.cf</b> configuration file.

       Upon  receipt of a request to deliver mail for an eligible
       destination, the <b>flush</b> server  requests  delivery  of  all
       messages  that  are  listed in that destination's logfile,
       regardless of the recipients of those  messages.  This  is
       not an issue for mail that is sent to a <b><a href="postconf.5.html#relay_domains">relay_domains</a></b> des-
       tination because such mail typically only  has  recipients
       in one domain.

<b>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS</b>
       Changes to <b>main.cf</b> are picked up automatically as <a href="flush.8.html">flush(8)</a>
       processes run for only a limited amount of time.  Use  the
       command "<b>postfix reload</b>" to speed up a change.
