PIPE(8)                                                   PIPE(8)


<b>NAME</b>
       pipe - Postfix delivery to external command

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>pipe</b> [generic Postfix daemon options] command_attributes...

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  <b>pipe</b> daemon processes requests from the Postfix queue
       manager to deliver messages  to  external  commands.  Each
       delivery request specifies a queue file, a sender address,
       a domain or host to deliver to, and one  or  more  recipi-
       ents.   This  program expects to be run from the <a href="master.8.html"><b>master</b>(8)</a>
       process manager.

       The <b>pipe</b> daemon updates queue files and  marks  recipients
       as finished, or it informs the queue manager that delivery
       should be tried again at a later  time.  Delivery  problem
       reports  are  sent  to the <a href="bounce.8.html"><b>bounce</b>(8)</a> or <a href="defer.8.html"><b>defer</b>(8)</a> daemon as
       appropriate.

<b>COMMAND</b> <b>ATTRIBUTE</b> <b>SYNTAX</b>
       The external command attributes are given in the <b>master.cf</b>
       file at the end of a service definition.  The syntax is as
       follows:

       <b>flags=BFR.</b>&gt; (optional)
              Optional message processing flags.  By  default,  a
              message is copied unchanged.

              <b>B</b>      Append  a blank line at the end of each mes-
                     sage. This is required  by  some  mail  user
                     agents  that  recognize  "<b>From</b>  " lines only
                     when preceded by a blank line.

              <b>F</b>      Prepend a "<b>From</b> <i>sender</i> <i>time_stamp</i>"  envelope
                     header  to  the  message  content.   This is
                     expected by, for example, <b>UUCP</b> software.

              <b>R</b>      Prepend a <b>Return-Path:</b> message  header  with
                     the envelope sender address.

              <b>.</b>      Prepend  <b>.</b>  to lines starting with "<b>.</b>". This
                     is needed by, for example, <b>BSMTP</b> software.

              &gt;      Prepend &gt; to lines starting  with  "<b>From</b>  ".
                     This is expected by, for example, <b>UUCP</b> soft-
                     ware.

       <b>user</b>=<i>username</i> (required)

       <b>user</b>=<i>username</i>:<i>groupname</i>
              The external command is executed with the rights of
              the  specified  <i>username</i>.   The software refuses to
              execute commands with root privileges, or with  the



                                                                1





PIPE(8)                                                   PIPE(8)


              privileges  of  the mail system owner. If <i>groupname</i>
              is specified, the corresponding group  ID  is  used
              instead of the group ID of <i>username</i>.

       <b>eol=string</b> (default: <b>\n</b>)
              The  output  record  delimiter. Typically one would
              use either <b>\r\n</b> or <b>\n</b>. The usual C-style  backslash
              escape  sequences are recognized: <b>\a</b> <b>\b</b> <b>\f</b> <b>\n</b> <b>\r</b> <b>\t</b>
              <b>\v</b> <b>\</b><i>octal</i> and <b>\\</b>.

       <b>size</b>=<i>size_limit</i> (optional)
              Messages greater in size than this limit (in bytes)
              will be bounced back to the sender.

       <b>argv</b>=<i>command</i>... (required)
              The  command to be executed. This must be specified
              as the last command attribute.  The command is exe-
              cuted  directly,  i.e.  without  interpretation  of
              shell meta characters by  a  shell  command  inter-
              preter.

              In  the  command  argument  vector,  the  following
              macros are recognized and replaced with correspond-
              ing  information  from  the  Postfix  queue manager
              delivery request:

              <b>${extension</b>}
                     This macro expands to the extension part  of
                     a  recipient  address.  For example, with an
                     address  <i>user+foo@domain</i>  the  extension  is
                     <i>foo</i>.   A command-line argument that contains
                     <b>${extension</b>} expands into as  many  command-
                     line arguments as there are recipients.

              <b>${mailbox</b>}
                     This  macro  expands  to  the complete local
                     part of a recipient address.   For  example,
                     with  an address <i>user+foo@domain</i> the mailbox
                     is <i>user+foo</i>.  A command-line  argument  that
                     contains  <b>${mailbox</b>}  expands  into  as many
                     command-line arguments as there are  recipi-
                     ents.

              <b>${nexthop</b>}
                     This macro expands to the next-hop hostname.

              <b>${recipient</b>}
                     This macro expands to the complete recipient
                     address.   A command-line argument that con-
                     tains <b>${recipient</b>} expands into as many com-
                     mand-line arguments as there are recipients.

              <b>${sender</b>}
                     This macro expands to  the  envelope  sender



                                                                2





PIPE(8)                                                   PIPE(8)


                     address.

              <b>${size</b>}
                     This  macro expands to Postfix's idea of the
                     message size, which is an  approximation  of
                     the size of the message as delivered.

              <b>${user</b>}
                     This macro expands to the username part of a
                     recipient address.   For  example,  with  an
                     address <i>user+foo@domain</i> the username part is
                     <i>user</i>.  A command-line argument that contains
                     <b>${user</b>}  expands  into  as many command-line
                     arguments as there are recipients.

       In addition to the  form  ${<i>name</i>},  the  forms  $<i>name</i>  and
       $(<i>name</i>)  are also recognized.  Specify <b>$$</b> where a single <b>$</b>
       is wanted.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Command exit status codes are expected to follow the  con-
       ventions defined in &lt;<b>sysexits.h</b>&gt;.

       Problems  and transactions are logged to <b>syslogd</b>(8).  Cor-
       rupted message files are marked so that the queue  manager
       can move them to the <b>corrupt</b> queue for further inspection.

<b>SECURITY</b>
       This program needs a dual personality  1)  to  access  the
       private  Postfix  queue and IPC mechanisms, and 2) to exe-
       cute external commands as the specified user. It is there-
       fore security sensitive.

<b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b>
       The  following  <b>main.cf</b> parameters are especially relevant
       to this program. See the Postfix <b>main.cf</b> file  for  syntax
       details  and  for  default  values. Use the <b>postfix</b> <b>reload</b>
       command after a configuration change.

<b>Miscellaneous</b>
       <b>export</b><i>_</i><b>environment</b>
              List of names of environment parameters that can be
              exported to non-Postfix processes.

       <b>mail</b><i>_</i><b>owner</b>
              The  process  privileges  used while not running an
              external command.

<b>Resource</b> <b>controls</b>
       In the text below, <i>transport</i> is the first field in a  <b>mas-</b>
       <b>ter.cf</b> entry.

       <i>transport_</i><b>destination</b><i>_</i><b>concurrency</b><i>_</i><b>limit</b>
              Limit the number of parallel deliveries to the same



                                                                3

              destination, for delivery via the named  <i>transport</i>.
              The  default limit is taken from the <b>default</b><i>_</i><b>desti-</b>
              <b>nation</b><i>_</i><b>concurrency</b><i>_</i><b>limit</b> parameter.  The  limit  is
              enforced by the Postfix queue manager.

       <i>transport_</i><b>destination</b><i>_</i><b>recipient</b><i>_</i><b>limit</b>
              Limit  the  number of recipients per message deliv-
              ery, for delivery  via  the  named  <i>transport</i>.  The
              default  limit  is  taken from the <b>default</b><i>_</i><b>destina-</b>
              <b>tion</b><i>_</i><b>recipient</b><i>_</i><b>limit</b>  parameter.   The   limit   is
              enforced by the Postfix queue manager.

       <i>transport_</i><b>time</b><i>_</i><b>limit</b>
              Limit  the  time  for delivery to external command,
              for delivery via the named <b>transport</b>.  The  default
              limit  is taken from the <b>command</b><i>_</i><b>time</b><i>_</i><b>limit</b> parame-
              ter.  The limit is enforced by  the  Postfix  queue
              manager.
