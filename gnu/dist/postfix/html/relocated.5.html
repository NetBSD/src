RELOCATED(5)                                         RELOCATED(5)

<b>NAME</b>
       relocated - format of Postfix relocated table

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>postmap</b> <b>/etc/postfix/relocated</b>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The optional <b>relocated</b> table provides the information that
       is used in "user has moved to  <i>new_location</i>"  bounce  mes-
       sages.

       Normally,  the <b>relocated</b> table is specified as a text file
       that serves as  input  to  the  <a href="postmap.1.html"><b>postmap</b>(1)</a>  command.   The
       result,  an  indexed file in <b>dbm</b> or <b>db</b> format, is used for
       fast searching by the mail  system.  Execute  the  command
       <b>postmap</b>  <b>/etc/postfix/relocated</b>  in  order  to rebuild the
       indexed file after changing the relocated table.

       When the table is provided via other means  such  as  NIS,
       LDAP  or  SQL,  the  same lookups are done as for ordinary
       indexed files.

       Alternatively, the table can be  provided  as  a  regular-
       expression map where patterns are given as regular expres-
       sions. In that case, the lookups are done  in  a  slightly
       different way as described below.

       Table lookups are case insensitive.

<b>TABLE</b> <b>FORMAT</b>
       The input format for the <a href="postmap.1.html"><b>postmap</b>(1)</a> command is as follows:

       <b>o</b>      An entry has one of the following form:
                   <i>pattern</i>      <i>new_location</i>
              Where <i>new_location</i>  specifies  contact  information
              such  as  an  email  address,  or  perhaps a street
              address or telephone number.

       <b>o</b>      Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are  ignored,
              as  are  lines whose first non-whitespace character
              is a `#'.

       <b>o</b>      A logical line starts with non-whitespace  text.  A
              line  that starts with whitespace continues a logi-
              cal line.

       With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from
       networked  tables  such  as NIS, LDAP or SQL, patterns are
       tried in the order as listed below:

       <i>user</i>@<i>domain</i>
              Matches <i>user</i>@<i>domain</i>. This form has precedence  over
              all other forms.

       <i>user</i>   Matches <i>user</i>@<i>site</i> when <i>site</i> is $<b>myorigin</b>, when <i>site</i>
              is listed in $<b>mydestination</b>, or when <i>site</i> is listed
              in $<b>inet</b><i>_</i><b>interfaces</b>.

       @<i>domain</i>
              Matches  every address in <i>domain</i>. This form has the
              lowest precedence.

<b>ADDRESS</b> <b>EXTENSION</b>
       When a mail address localpart contains the optional recip-
       ient  delimiter  (e.g., <i>user+foo</i>@<i>domain</i>), the lookup order
       becomes: <i>user+foo</i>@<i>domain</i>, <i>user</i>@<i>domain</i>, <i>user+foo</i>, <i>user</i>, and
       @<i>domain</i>.

<b>REGULAR</b> <b>EXPRESSION</b> <b>TABLES</b>
       This  section  describes how the table lookups change when
       the table is given in the form of regular expressions. For
       a  description  of regular expression lookup table syntax,
       see <a href="regexp_table.5.html"><b>regexp</b><i>_</i><b>table</b>(5)</a> or <a href="pcre_table.5.html"><b>pcre</b><i>_</i><b>table</b>(5)</a>.

       Each pattern is a regular expression that  is  applied  to
       the entire address being looked up. Thus, <i>user@domain</i> mail
       addresses are not broken up into their  <i>user</i>  and  <i>@domain</i>
       constituent parts, nor is <i>user+foo</i> broken up into <i>user</i> and
       <i>foo</i>.

       Patterns are applied in the  order  as  specified  in  the
       table,  until  a  pattern is found that matches the search
       string.

       Results are the same as with indexed  file  lookups,  with
       the  additional feature that parenthesized substrings from
       the pattern can be interpolated as <b>$1</b>, <b>$2</b> and so on.

<b>BUGS</b>
       The table format does not understand quoting  conventions.

<b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b>
       The  following  <b>main.cf</b> parameters are especially relevant
       to this topic. See the Postfix  <b>main.cf</b>  file  for  syntax
       details  and  for  default  values. Use the <b>postfix</b> <b>reload</b>
       command after a configuration change.

       <b>relocated</b><i>_</i><b>maps</b>
              List of lookup tables for relocated users or sites.

       Other parameters of interest:

       <b>inet</b><i>_</i><b>interfaces</b>
              The  network  interface  addresses that this system
              receives mail on.  You need to stop and start Post-
              fix when this parameter changes.

       <b>mydestination</b>
              List  of  domains  that  this mail system considers
              local.

       <b>myorigin</b>
              The domain that is appended to locally-posted mail.
