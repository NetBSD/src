CANONICAL(5)                                         CANONICAL(5)


<b>NAME</b>
       canonical - format of Postfix canonical table

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>postmap</b> <b>/etc/postfix/canonical</b>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  optional <b>canonical</b> table specifies an address mapping
       for local and non-local addresses. The mapping is used  by
       the  <a href="cleanup.8.html"><b>cleanup</b>(8)</a> daemon.  The address mapping is recursive.

       Normally, the <b>canonical</b> table is specified as a text  file
       that  serves  as  input  to  the  <a href="postmap.1.html"><b>postmap</b>(1)</a> command.  The
       result, an indexed file in <b>dbm</b> or <b>db</b> format, is  used  for
       fast  searching  by  the  mail system. Execute the command
       <b>postmap</b> <b>/etc/postfix/canonical</b> in  order  to  rebuild  the
       indexed file after changing the text file.

       When  the  table  is provided via other means such as NIS,
       LDAP or SQL, the same lookups are  done  as  for  ordinary
       indexed files.

       Alternatively,  the  table  can  be provided as a regular-
       expression map where patterns are given as regular expres-
       sions.  In  that  case, the lookups are done in a slightly
       different way as described below.

       The  <b>canonical</b>  mapping  affects   both   message   header
       addresses (i.e. addresses that appear inside messages) and
       message envelope addresses  (for  example,  the  addresses
       that  are  used in SMTP protocol commands). Think Sendmail
       rule set <b>S3</b>, if you like.

       Typically, one would use the <b>canonical</b>  table  to  replace
       login   names   by  <i>Firstname.Lastname</i>,  or  to  clean  up
       addresses produced by legacy mail systems.

       The <b>canonical</b> mapping is not to be confused  with  <i>virtual</i>
       <i>domain</i> support. Use the <a href="virtual.5.html"><b>virtual</b>(5)</a> map for that purpose.

       The  <b>canonical</b>  mapping  is  not to be confused with local
       aliasing.  Use the <a href="aliases.5.html"><b>aliases</b>(5)</a> map for that purpose.

<b>TABLE</b> <b>FORMAT</b>
       The format of the <b>canonical</b> table is as follows:

       blanks and comments
              Blank lines are ignored,  as  are  lines  beginning
              with `#'.

       leading whitespace
              Lines  that begin with whitespace continue the pre-
              vious line.




                                                                1

       <i>pattern</i> <i>result</i>
              When <i>pattern</i> matches a mail address, replace it  by
              the corresponding <i>result</i>.

       With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from
       networked tables such as NIS, LDAP or  SQL,  patterns  are
       tried in the order as listed below:

       <i>user</i>@<i>domain</i> <i>address</i>
              <i>user</i>@<i>domain</i>  is  replaced by <i>address</i>. This form has
              the highest precedence.

              This form useful to clean up addresses produced  by
              legacy  mail  systems.  It can also be used to pro-
              duce <i>Firstname.Lastname</i> style  addresses,  but  see
              below for a simpler solution.

       <i>user</i> <i>address</i>
              <i>user</i>@<i>site</i> is replaced by <i>address</i> when <i>site</i> is equal
              to $<b>myorigin</b>, when <i>site</i> is  listed  in  $<b>mydestina-</b>
              <b>tion</b>, or when it is listed in $<b>inet</b><i>_</i><b>interfaces</b>.

              This  form  is  useful for replacing login names by
              <i>Firstname.Lastname</i>.

       @<i>domain</i> <i>address</i>
              Every address in <i>domain</i>  is  replaced  by  <i>address</i>.
              This form has the lowest precedence.

       In  all the above forms, when <i>address</i> has the form @<i>other-</i>
       <i>domain</i>, the result is the same user in <i>otherdomain</i>.

<b>ADDRESS</b> <b>EXTENSION</b>
       When table lookup fails, and the  address  localpart  con-
       tains    the    optional    recipient   delimiter   (e.g.,
       <i>user+foo</i>@<i>domain</i>), the search is  repeated  for  the  unex-
       tended  address  (e.g.   <i>user</i>@<i>domain</i>),  and  the unmatched
       extension is propagated to the result of table lookup. The
       matching order is: <i>user+foo</i>@<i>domain</i>, <i>user</i>@<i>domain</i>, <i>user+foo</i>,
       <i>user</i>, and @<i>domain</i>.

<b>REGULAR</b> <b>EXPRESSION</b> <b>TABLES</b>
       This section describes how the table lookups  change  when
       the table is given in the form of regular expressions. For
       a description of regular expression lookup  table  syntax,
       see <a href="regexp_table.5.html"><b>regexp</b><i>_</i><b>table</b>(5)</a> or <a href="pcre_table.5.html"><b>pcre</b><i>_</i><b>table</b>(5)</a>.

       Each  pattern  is  a regular expression that is applied to
       the entire address being looked up. Thus, <i>user@domain</i> mail
       addresses  are  not  broken up into their <i>user</i> and <i>@domain</i>
       constituent parts, nor is <i>user+foo</i> broken up into <i>user</i> and
       <i>foo</i>.

       Patterns  are  applied  in  the  order as specified in the



                                                                2

       table, until a pattern is found that  matches  the  search
       string.

       Results  are the same as with normal indexed file lookups,
       with the additional feature that parenthesized  substrings
       from  the pattern can be interpolated as <b>$1</b>, <b>$2</b> and so on.

<b>BUGS</b>
       The table format does not understand quoting  conventions.
