SHOWQ(8)                                                 SHOWQ(8)

<b>NAME</b>
       showq - list the Postfix mail queue

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>showq</b> [generic Postfix daemon options]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  <b>showq</b>  daemon  reports the Postfix mail queue status.
       It is the program that emulates the sendmail `mailq'  com-
       mand.

       The  <b>showq</b>  daemon  can also be run in stand-alone mode by
       the super-user. This mode of operation is used to  emulate
       the `mailq' command while the Postfix mail system is down.

<b>SECURITY</b>
       The <b>showq</b> daemon can run in a chroot  jail  at  fixed  low
       privilege, and takes no input from the client. Its service
       port is accessible to local untrusted users, so  the  ser-
       vice can be susceptible to denial of service attacks.

<b>STANDARDS</b>
       None.  The showq daemon does not interact with the outside
       world.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Problems and transactions are logged to <b>syslogd</b>(8).

<b>BUGS</b>
       The <b>showq</b> daemon runs at a  fixed  low  privilege;  conse-
       quently, it cannot extract information from queue files in
       the <b>maildrop</b> directory.
