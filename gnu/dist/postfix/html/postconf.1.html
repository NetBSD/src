POSTCONF(1)                                           POSTCONF(1)

<b>NAME</b>
       postconf - Postfix configuration utility

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>postconf</b> [<b>-dhmlnv</b>] [<b>-c</b> <i>config_dir</i>] [<i>parameter</i> <i>...</i>]

       <b>postconf</b> [<b>-ev</b>] [<b>-c</b> <i>config_dir</i>] [<i>parameter=value</i> <i>...</i>]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  <b>postconf</b> command prints the actual value of <i>parameter</i>
       (all known parameters by default) one parameter per  line,
       changes  its  value, or prints other information about the
       Postfix mail system.

       Options:

       <b>-c</b> <i>config_dir</i>
              The <b>main.cf</b> configuration  file  is  in  the  named
              directory  instead  of  the  default  configuration
              directory.

       <b>-d</b>     Print default parameter settings instead of  actual
              settings.

       <b>-e</b>     Edit  the  <b>main.cf</b>  configuration file. The file is
              copied to a temporary file then renamed into place.
              Parameters  and values are specified on the command
              line.  Use  quotes  in  order  to   protect   shell
              metacharacters and whitespace.

       <b>-h</b>     Show  parameter  values  only,  not the ``name = ''
              label that normally precedes the value.

       <b>-l</b>     List the names of  all  supported  mailbox  locking
              methods.  Postfix supports the following methods:

              <b>flock</b>  A  kernel-based  advisory locking method for
                     local files only.  This  locking  method  is
                     available only on systems with a BSD compat-
                     ible library.

              <b>fcntl</b>  A kernel-based advisory locking  method  for
                     local and remote files.

              <b>dotlock</b>
                     An   application-level  locking  method.  An
                     application locks a file named  <i>filename</i>  by
                     creating  a  file  named <i>filename</i><b>.lock</b>.  The
                     application is expected to  remove  its  own
                     lock  file, as well as stale lock files that
                     were left behind after abnormal termination.

       <b>-m</b>     List the names of all supported lookup table types.
              Postfix lookup tables are specified  as  <i>type</i><b>:</b><i>name</i>,
              where  <i>type</i>  is  one of the types listed below. The
              table <i>name</i> syntax depends on the lookup table type.

              <b>btree</b>  A  sorted, balanced tree structure.  This is
                     available only on systems with  support  for
                     Berkeley DB databases.

              <b>dbm</b>    An indexed file type based on hashing.  This
                     is available only on  systems  with  support
                     for DBM databases.

              <b>environ</b>
                     The  UNIX  process  environment  array.  The
                     lookup key is the variable name.  Originally
                     implemented  for  testing,  someone may find
                     this useful someday.

              <b>hash</b>   An indexed file type based on hashing.  This
                     is  available  only  on systems with support
                     for Berkeley DB databases.

              <b>ldap</b> (read-only)
                     Perform lookups  using  the  LDAP  protocol.
                     This is described in an LDAP_README file.

              <b>mysql</b> (read-only)
                     Perform  lookups  using  the MYSQL protocol.
                     This is described in a MYSQL_README file.

              <b>pcre</b> (read-only)
                     A lookup table based on Perl Compatible Reg-
                     ular   Expressions.   The   file  format  is
                     described in <a href="pcre_table.5.html"><b>pcre</b><i>_</i><b>table</b>(5)</a>.

              <b>proxy</b> (read-only)
                     A lookup table that is implemented  via  the
                     Postfix  <a href="proxymap.8.html"><b>proxymap</b>(8)</a> service. The table name
                     syntax is <i>type</i><b>:</b><i>name</i>.

              <b>regexp</b> (read-only)
                     A lookup table based on regular expressions.
                     The   file   format  is  described  in  <a href="regexp_table.5.html"><b>reg-</b>
                     <b>exp</b><i>_</i><b>table</b>(5)</a>.

              <b>static</b> (read-only)
                     A table that  always  returns  its  name  as
                     lookup  result.  For  example, <b>static:foobar</b>
                     always returns the string <b>foobar</b>  as  lookup
                     result.

              <b>unix</b> (read-only)
                     A  limited way to query the UNIX authentica-
                     tion  database.  The  following  tables  are
                     implemented:

                     <b>unix:passwd.byname</b>
                             The   table  is  the  UNIX  password
                             database. The key is a  login  name.
                             The  result is a password file entry
                             in passwd(5) format.

                     <b>unix:group.byname</b>
                             The  table   is   the   UNIX   group
                             database.  The  key is a group name.
                             The result is a group file entry  in
                             group(5) format.

       Other  table  types may exist depending on how Postfix was
       built.

       <b>-n</b>     Print non-default parameter settings only.

       <b>-v</b>     Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Mul-
              tiple  <b>-v</b>  options  make  the software increasingly
              verbose.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Problems are reported to the standard error stream.

<b>ENVIRONMENT</b>
