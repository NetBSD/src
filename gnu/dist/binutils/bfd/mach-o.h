   the data structures for the dynamically link editor.

   The original set of symbolic information in the symtab_command which contains
   the symbol and string tables must also be present when this load command is
   present.  When this load command is present the symbol table is organized
   into three groups of symbols:
       local symbols (static and debugging symbols) - grouped by module
       defined external symbols - grouped by module (sorted by name if not lib)
       undefined external symbols (sorted by name)
   In this load command there are offsets and counts to each of the three groups
   of symbols.

   This load command contains a the offsets and sizes of the following new
   symbolic information tables:
       table of contents
       module table
       reference symbol table
       indirect symbol table
   The first three tables above (the table of contents, module table and
   reference symbol table) are only present if the file is a dynamically linked
   shared library.  For executable and object modules, which are files
   containing only one module, the information that would be in these three
   tables is determined as follows:
       table of contents - the defined external symbols are sorted by name
       module table - the file contains only one module so everything in the
                      file is part of the module.
       reference symbol table - is the defined and undefined external symbols

   For dynamically linked shared library files this load command also contains
   offsets and sizes to the pool of relocation entries for all sections
   separated into two groups:
       external relocation entries
       local relocation entries
   For executable and object modules the relocation entries continue to hang

     entries of non-merged sections are not referenced through the section

     set to zero).

     Since the relocation entries are not accessed through the section headers
     this requires the r_address field to be something other than a section
     offset to identify the item to be relocated.  In this case r_address is
     set to the offset from the vmaddr of the first LC_SEGMENT command.

     The relocation entries are grouped by module and the module table
     entries have indexes and counts into them for the group of external
