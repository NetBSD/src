@node 32x32
@chapter 32x32

@section Options
The 32x32 version of @code{@value{AS}} accepts a @samp{-m32032} option to
specify thiat it is compiling for a 32032 processor, or a
@samp{-m32532} to specify that it is compiling for a 32532 option.
The default (if neither is specified) is chosen when the assembler
is compiled.

@section Syntax
I don't know anything about the 32x32 syntax assembled by
@code{@value{AS}}.  Someone who understands the processor (I've never seen
one) and the possible syntaxes should write this section.

@section Floating Point
The 32x32 uses @sc{ieee} floating point numbers, but @code{@value{AS}}
only creates single or double precision values.  I don't know if the
32x32 understands extended precision numbers.

@section 32x32 Machine Directives
The 32x32 has no machine dependent directives.
