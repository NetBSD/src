## Replacement for AC_PROG_LEX and AC_DECL_YYTEXT
## by Alexandre Oliva <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>

## We need to override the installed aclocal/lex.m4 because of a bug in
## this definition in the recommended automake snapshot of 000227:
## There were double-quotes around ``$missing_dir/missing flex'' which was
## bad since aclocal wraps it in double-quotes.

dnl AM_PROG_LEX
dnl Look for flex, lex or missing, then run AC_PROG_LEX and AC_DECL_YYTEXT
