Introduction to Line Editing
============================

   The following paragraphs describe the notation we use to represent
keystrokes.

   The text <C-k> is read as `Control-K' and describes the character
produced when the Control key is depressed and the <k> key is struck.

   The text <M-k> is read as `Meta-K' and describes the character
produced when the meta key (if you have one) is depressed, and the <k>
key is struck.  If you do not have a meta key, the identical keystroke
can be generated by typing <ESC> first, and then typing <k>.  Either
process is known as "metafying" the <k> key.

   The text <M-C-k> is read as `Meta-Control-k' and describes the
character produced by "metafying" <C-k>.

   In addition, several keys have their own names.  Specifically,
<DEL>, <ESC>, <LFD>, <SPC>, <RET>, and <TAB> all stand for themselves
when seen in this text, or in an init file (*note Readline Init
File::., for more info).

Readline Interaction
====================

   Often during an interactive session you type in a long line of text,
only to notice that the first word on the line is misspelled.  The
Readline library gives you a set of commands for manipulating the text
as you type it in, allowing you to just fix your typo, and not forcing
you to retype the majority of the line.  Using these editing commands,
you move the cursor to the place that needs correction, and delete or
insert the text of the corrections.  Then, when you are satisfied with
the line, you simply press <RET>.  You do not have to be at the end of
the line to press <RET>; the entire line is accepted regardless of the
location of the cursor within the line.

Readline Bare Essentials
------------------------

   In order to enter characters into the line, simply type them.  The
typed character appears where the cursor was, and then the cursor moves
one space to the right.  If you mistype a character, you can use <DEL>
to back up, and delete the mistyped character.

   Sometimes you may miss typing a character that you wanted to type,
and not notice your error until you have typed several other
characters.  In that case, you can type <C-b> to move the cursor to the
left, and then correct your mistake.  Aftwerwards, you can move the
cursor to the right with <C-f>.

   When you add text in the middle of a line, you will notice that
characters to the right of the cursor get `pushed over' to make room
for the text that you have inserted.  Likewise, when you delete text
behind the cursor, characters to the right of the cursor get `pulled
back' to fill in the blank space created by the removal of the text.  A
list of the basic bare essentials for editing the text of an input line
follows.

<C-b>
     Move back one character.

<C-f>
     Move forward one character.

<DEL>
     Delete the character to the left of the cursor.

<C-d>
     Delete the character underneath the cursor.

Printing characters
     Insert itself into the line at the cursor.

<C-_>
     Undo the last thing that you did.  You can undo all the way back
     to an empty line.

Readline Movement Commands
--------------------------

   The above table describes the most basic possible keystrokes that
you need in order to do editing of the input line.  For your
convenience, many other commands have been added in addition to <C-b>,
<C-f>, <C-d>, and <DEL>.  Here are some commands for moving more rapidly
about the line.

<C-a>
     Move to the start of the line.

<C-e>
     Move to the end of the line.

<M-f>
     Move forward a word.

<M-b>
     Move backward a word.

<C-l>
     Clear the screen, reprinting the current line at the top.

   Notice how <C-f> moves forward a character, while <M-f> moves
forward a word.  It is a loose convention that control keystrokes
operate on characters while meta keystrokes operate on words.

Readline Killing Commands
-------------------------

   "Killing" text means to delete the text from the line, but to save
it away for later use, usually by "yanking" it back into the line.  If
the description for a command says that it `kills' text, then you can
be sure that you can get the text back in a different (or the same)
place later.

   Here is the list of commands for killing text.

<C-k>
     Kill the text from the current cursor position to the end of the
     line.

<M-d>
     Kill from the cursor to the end of the current word, or if between
     words, to the end of the next word.

<M-DEL>
     Kill from the cursor to the start of the previous word, or if
     between words, to the start of the previous word.

<C-w>
     Kill from the cursor to the previous whitespace.  This is
     different than <M-DEL> because the word boundaries differ.

   And, here is how to "yank" the text back into the line.

<C-y>
     Yank the most recently killed text back into the buffer at the
     cursor.

<M-y>
     Rotate the kill-ring, and yank the new top.  You can only do this
     if the prior command is <C-y> or <M-y>.

   When you use a kill command, the text is saved in a "kill-ring".
Any number of consecutive kills save all of the killed text together, so
that when you yank it back, you get it in one clean sweep.  The kill
ring is not line specific; the text that you killed on a previously
typed line is available to be yanked back later, when you are typing
another line.

Readline Arguments
------------------

   You can pass numeric arguments to Readline commands.  Sometimes the
argument acts as a repeat count, other times it is the sign of the
argument that is significant.  If you pass a negative argument to a
command which normally acts in a forward direction, that command will
act in a backward direction.  For example, to kill text back to the
start of the line, you might type <M-> <C-k>.

   The general way to pass numeric arguments to a command is to type
meta digits before the command.  If the first `digit' you type is a
minus sign (<->), then the sign of the argument will be negative.  Once
you have typed one meta digit to get the argument started, you can type
the remainder of the digits, and then the command.  For example, to give
the <C-d> command an argument of 10, you could type <M-1 0 C-d>.

Readline Init File
==================

   Although the Readline library comes with a set of GNU Emacs-like
keybindings, it is possible that you would like to use a different set
of keybindings.  You can customize programs that use Readline by putting
commands in an "init" file in your home directory.  The name of this
file is `~/.inputrc'.

   When a program which uses the Readline library starts up, the
`~/.inputrc' file is read, and the keybindings are set.

   In addition, the <C-x C-r> command re-reads this init file, thus
incorporating any changes that you might have made to it.

* Menu:

* Readline Init Syntax::	Syntax for the commands in `~/.inputrc'.
* Readline vi Mode::		Switching to `vi' mode in Readline.


File: readline.info,  Node: Readline Init Syntax,  Next: Readline vi Mode,  Up: Readline Init File

Readline Init Syntax
--------------------

   There are only four constructs allowed in the `~/.inputrc' file:

Variable Settings
     You can change the state of a few variables in Readline.  You do
     this by using the `set' command within the init file.  Here is how
     you would specify that you wish to use `vi' line editing commands:

          set editing-mode vi

     Right now, there are only a few variables which can be set; so few
     in fact, that we just iterate them here:

    `editing-mode'
          The `editing-mode' variable controls which editing mode you
          are using.  By default, GNU Readline starts up in Emacs
          editing mode, where the keystrokes are most similar to Emacs.
          This variable can either be set to `emacs' or `vi'.

    `horizontal-scroll-mode'
          This variable can either be set to `On' or `Off'.  Setting it
          to `On' means that the text of the lines that you edit will
          scroll horizontally on a single screen line when they are
          larger than the width of the screen, instead of wrapping onto
          a new screen line.  By default, this variable is set to `Off'.

    `mark-modified-lines'
          This variable when set to `On', says to display an asterisk
          (`*') at the starts of history lines which have been modified.
          This variable is off by default.

    `prefer-visible-bell'
          If this variable is set to `On' it means to use a visible
          bell if one is available, rather than simply ringing the
          terminal bell.  By default, the value is `Off'.

Key Bindings
     The syntax for controlling keybindings in the `~/.inputrc' file is
     simple.  First you have to know the name of the command that you
     want to change.  The following pages contain tables of the command
     name, the default keybinding, and a short description of what the
     command does.

     Once you know the name of the command, simply place the name of
     the key you wish to bind the command to, a colon, and then the
     name of the command on a line in the `~/.inputrc' file.  The name
     of the key can be expressed in different ways, depending on which
     is most comfortable for you.

    KEYNAME: FUNCTION-NAME or MACRO
          KEYNAME is the name of a key spelled out in English.  For
          example:
               Control-u: universal-argument
               Meta-Rubout: backward-kill-word
               Control-o: ">&output"

          In the above example, <C-u> is bound to the function
          `universal-argument', and <C-o> is bound to run the macro
          expressed on the right hand side (that is, to insert the text
          `>&output' into the line).

    "KEYSEQ": FUNCTION-NAME or MACRO
          KEYSEQ differs from KEYNAME above in that strings denoting an
          entire key sequence can be specified.  Simply place the key
          sequence in double quotes.  GNU Emacs style key escapes can
          be used, as in the following example:

               "\C-u": universal-argument
               "\C-x\C-r": re-read-init-file
               "\e[11~": "Function Key 1"

          In the above example, <C-u> is bound to the function
          `universal-argument' (just as it was in the first example),
          <C-x C-r> is bound to the function `re-read-init-file', and
          <ESC [ 1 1 ~> is bound to insert the text `Function Key 1'.

Commands For Moving
...................

`beginning-of-line (<C-a>)'
     Move to the start of the current line.

`end-of-line (<C-e>)'
     Move to the end of the line.

`forward-char (<C-f>)'
     Move forward a character.

`backward-char (<C-b>)'
     Move back a character.

`forward-word (<M-f>)'
     Move forward to the end of the next word.

`backward-word (<M-b>)'
     Move back to the start of this, or the previous, word.

     Clear the screen leaving the current line at the top of the screen.


File: readline.info,  Node: Commands For History,  Next: Commands For Text,  Prev: Commands For Moving,  Up: Readline Init Syntax

Commands For Manipulating The History
.....................................

`accept-line (Newline, Return)'
     Accept the line regardless of where the cursor is.  If this line is
     non-empty, add it to the history list.  If this line was a history
     line, then restore the history line to its original state.

`previous-history (<C-p>)'
     Move `up' through the history list.

`next-history (<C-n>)'
     Move `down' through the history list.

`beginning-of-history (<M-<>)'
     Move to the first line in the history.

`end-of-history (<M->>)'
     Move to the end of the input history, i.e., the line you are
     entering.

`reverse-search-history (<C-r>)'
     Search backward starting at the current line and moving `up'
     through the history as necessary.  This is an incremental search.

`forward-search-history (<C-s>)'
     Search forward starting at the current line and moving `down'
     through the the history as necessary.


File: readline.info,  Node: Commands For Text,  Next: Commands For Killing,  Prev: Commands For History,  Up: Readline Init Syntax

Commands For Changing Text
..........................

`delete-char (<C-d>)'
     Delete the character under the cursor.  If the cursor is at the
     beginning of the line, and there are no characters in the line, and
     the last character typed was not <C-d>, then return EOF.

`backward-delete-char (Rubout)'
     Delete the character behind the cursor.  A numeric argument says
     to kill the characters instead of deleting them.

`quoted-insert (<C-q>, <C-v>)'
     Add the next character that you type to the line verbatim.  This is
     how to insert things like <C-q> for example.

`tab-insert (<M-TAB>)'
     Insert a tab character.

`self-insert (a, b, A, 1, !, ...)'
     Insert yourself.

`transpose-chars (<C-t>)'
     Drag the character before point forward over the character at
     point.  Point moves forward as well.  If point is at the end of
     the line, then transpose the two characters before point.
     Negative arguments don't work.

`transpose-words (<M-t>)'
     Drag the word behind the cursor past the word in front of the
     cursor moving the cursor over that word as well.

`upcase-word (<M-u>)'
     Uppercase all letters in the current (or following) word.  With a
     negative argument, do the previous word, but do not move point.

`downcase-word (<M-l>)'
     Lowercase all letters in the current (or following) word.  With a
     negative argument, do the previous word, but do not move point.

`capitalize-word (<M-c>)'
     Uppercase the first letter in the current (or following) word.
     With a negative argument, do the previous word, but do not move
     point.


File: readline.info,  Node: Commands For Killing,  Next: Numeric Arguments,  Prev: Commands For Text,  Up: Readline Init Syntax

Killing And Yanking
...................

`kill-line (<C-k>)'
     Kill the text from the current cursor position to the end of the
     line.

`backward-kill-line ()'
     Kill backward to the beginning of the line.  This is normally
     unbound.

`kill-word (<M-d>)'
     Kill from the cursor to the end of the current word, or if between
     words, to the end of the next word.

`backward-kill-word (<M-DEL>)'
     Kill the word behind the cursor.

`unix-line-discard (<C-u>)'
     Kill the whole line the way <C-u> used to in Unix line input.  The
     killed text is saved on the kill-ring.

`unix-word-rubout (<C-w>)'
     Kill the word the way <C-w> used to in Unix line input.  The
     killed text is saved on the kill-ring.  This is different than
     backward-kill-word because the word boundaries differ.

`yank (<C-y>)'
     Yank the top of the kill ring into the buffer at point.

`yank-pop (<M-y>)'
     Rotate the kill-ring, and yank the new top.  You can only do this
     if the prior command is yank or yank-pop.


File: readline.info,  Node: Numeric Arguments,  Next: Commands For Completion,  Prev: Commands For Killing,  Up: Readline Init Syntax

Specifying Numeric Arguments
............................

`digit-argument (<M-0>, <M-1>, ... <M-->)'
     Add this digit to the argument already accumulating, or start a new
     argument.  <M-> starts a negative argument.

`universal-argument ()'
     Do what <C-u> does in GNU Emacs.  By default, this is not bound.


File: readline.info,  Node: Commands For Completion,  Next: Miscellaneous Commands,  Prev: Numeric Arguments,  Up: Readline Init Syntax

Letting Readline Type For You
.............................

`complete (TAB)'
     Attempt to do completion on the text before point.  This is
     implementation defined.  Generally, if you are typing a filename
     argument, you can do filename completion; if you are typing a
     command, you can do command completion, if you are typing in a
     symbol to GDB, you can do symbol name completion, if you are
     typing in a variable to Bash, you can do variable name completion.

`possible-completions (M-?)'
     List the possible completions of the text before point.


File: readline.info,  Node: Miscellaneous Commands,  Prev: Commands For Completion,  Up: Readline Init Syntax

Some Miscellaneous Commands
...........................

`re-read-init-file (<C-x> <C-r>)'
     Read in the contents of your `~/.inputrc' file, and incorporate
     any bindings found there.

`abort (<C-g>)'
     Stop running the current editing command.

`prefix-meta (ESC)'
     Make the next character that you type be metafied.  This is for
     people without a meta key.  Typing <ESC f> is equivalent to typing
     <M-f>.

`undo (<C-_>)'
     Incremental undo, separately remembered for each line.

`revert-line (<M-r>)'
     Undo all changes made to this line.  This is like typing the `undo'
     command enough times to get back to the beginning.


File: readline.info,  Node: Readline vi Mode,  Prev: Readline Init Syntax,  Up: Readline Init File

Readline `vi' Mode
------------------

   While the Readline library does not have a full set of `vi' editing
functions, it does contain enough to allow simple editing of the line.

   In order to switch interactively between GNU Emacs and `vi' editing
modes, use the command <M-C-j> (toggle-editing-mode).

   When you enter a line in `vi' mode, you are already placed in
`insertion' mode, as if you had typed an `i'.  Pressing <ESC> switches
you into `edit' mode, where you can edit the text of the line with the
standard `vi' movement keys, move to previous history lines with `k',
and following lines with `j', and so forth.

Programming with GNU Readline
*****************************

   This manual describes the interface between the GNU Readline Library
and user programs.  If you are a programmer, and you wish to include the
features found in GNU Readline in your own programs, such as completion,
line editing, and interactive history manipulation, this documentation
is for you.

* Menu:

* Default Behaviour::	Using the default behaviour of Readline.
* Custom Functions::	Adding your own functions to Readline.
* Custom Completers::	Supplanting or supplementing Readline's
			completion functions.


File: readline.info,  Node: Default Behaviour,  Next: Custom Functions,  Up: Programming with GNU Readline

Default Behaviour
=================

   Many programs provide a command line interface, such as `mail',
`ftp', and `sh'.  For such programs, the default behaviour of Readline
is sufficient.  This section describes how to use Readline in the
simplest way possible, perhaps to replace calls in your code to `gets
()'.

   The function `readline' prints a prompt and then reads and returns a
single line of text from the user.  The line which `readline ()'
returns is allocated with `malloc ()'; you should `free ()' the line
when you are done with it.  The declaration for `readline' in ANSI C is

     `char *readline (char *PROMPT);'

   So, one might say
     `char *line = readline ("Enter a line: ");'
   in order to read a line of text from the user.

   The line which is returned has the final newline removed, so only the
text of the line remains.

   If readline encounters an `EOF' while reading the line, and the line
is empty at that point, then `(char *)NULL' is returned.  Otherwise,
the line is ended just as if a newline was typed.

   If you want the user to be able to get at the line later, (with
<C-p> for example), you must call `add_history ()' to save the line
away in a "history" list of such lines.

     `add_history (line)';

   For full details on the GNU History Library, see the associated
manual.

   It is polite to avoid saving empty lines on the history list, since
it is rare than someone has a burning need to reuse a blank line.  Here
is a function which usefully replaces the standard `gets ()' library
function:

     /* A static variable for holding the line. */
     static char *line_read = (char *)NULL;
     
     /* Read a string, and return a pointer to it.  Returns NULL on EOF. */
     char *
     do_gets ()
     {
       /* If the buffer has already been allocated, return the memory
          to the free pool. */
       if (line_read != (char *)NULL)
         {
           free (line_read);
           line_read = (char *)NULL;
         }
     
       /* Get a line from the user. */
       line_read = readline ("");
     
       /* If the line has any text in it, save it on the history. */
       if (line_read && *line_read)
         add_history (line_read);
     
       return (line_read);
     }

   The above code gives the user the default behaviour of <TAB>
completion: completion on file names.  If you do not want readline to
complete on filenames, you can change the binding of the <TAB> key with
`rl_bind_key ()'.

     `int rl_bind_key (int KEY, int (*FUNCTION)());'

   `rl_bind_key ()' takes 2 arguments; KEY is the character that you
want to bind, and FUNCTION is the address of the function to run when
KEY is pressed.  Binding <TAB> to `rl_insert ()' makes <TAB> just
insert itself.

   `rl_bind_key ()' returns non-zero if KEY is not a valid ASCII
character code (between 0 and 255).

     `rl_bind_key ('\t', rl_insert);'

   This code should be executed once at the start of your program; you
might write a function called `initialize_readline ()' which performs

Custom Functions
================

   Readline provides a great many functions for manipulating the text of
the line.  But it isn't possible to anticipate the needs of all
programs.  This section describes the various functions and variables
defined in within the Readline library which allow a user program to add
customized functionality to Readline.

The Function Type
-----------------

   For the sake of readabilty, we declare a new type of object, called
"Function".  A `Function' is a C language function which returns an
`int'.  The type declaration for `Function' is:

`typedef int Function ();'

   The reason for declaring this new type is to make it easier to write
code describing pointers to C functions.  Let us say we had a variable
called FUNC which was a pointer to a function.  Instead of the classic
C declaration

   `int (*)()func;'

   we have

   `Function *func;'

Naming a Function
-----------------

   The user can dynamically change the bindings of keys while using
Readline.  This is done by representing the function with a descriptive
name.  The user is able to type the descriptive name when referring to
the function.  Thus, in an init file, one might find

     Meta-Rubout:	backward-kill-word

   This binds the keystroke <Meta-Rubout> to the function
*descriptively* named `backward-kill-word'.  You, as the programmer,
should bind the functions you write to descriptive names as well.
Readline provides a function for doing that:

 - Function: rl_add_defun (CHAR *NAME, FUNCTION *FUNCTION, INT KEY)
     Add NAME to the list of named functions.  Make FUNCTION be the
     function that gets called.  If KEY is not -1, then bind it to
     FUNCTION using `rl_bind_key ()'.

   Using this function alone is sufficient for most applications.  It is
the recommended way to add a few functions to the default functions that
Readline has built in already.  If you need to do more or different
things than adding a function to Readline, you may need to use the
underlying functions described below.


File: readline.info,  Node: Keymaps,  Next: Binding Keys,  Prev: Function Naming,  Up: Custom Functions

Selecting a Keymap
------------------

   Key bindings take place on a "keymap".  The keymap is the
association between the keys that the user types and the functions that
get run.  You can make your own keymaps, copy existing keymaps, and tell
Readline which keymap to use.

 - Function: Keymap rl_make_bare_keymap ()
     Returns a new, empty keymap.  The space for the keymap is
     allocated with `malloc ()'; you should `free ()' it when you are
     done.

 - Function: Keymap rl_copy_keymap (KEYMAP MAP)
     Return a new keymap which is a copy of MAP.

 - Function: Keymap rl_make_keymap ()
     Return a new keymap with the printing characters bound to
     rl_insert, the lowercase Meta characters bound to run their
     equivalents, and the Meta digits bound to produce numeric
     arguments.


File: readline.info,  Node: Binding Keys,  Next: Function Writing,  Prev: Keymaps,  Up: Custom Functions

Binding Keys
------------

   You associate keys with functions through the keymap.  Here are
functions for doing that.

 - Function: int rl_bind_key (INT KEY, FUNCTION *FUNCTION)
     Binds KEY to FUNCTION in the currently selected keymap.  Returns
     non-zero in the case of an invalid KEY.

 - Function: int rl_bind_key_in_map (INT KEY, FUNCTION *FUNCTION,
          KEYMAP MAP)
     Bind KEY to FUNCTION in MAP.  Returns non-zero in the case of an
     invalid KEY.

 - Function: int rl_unbind_key (INT KEY)
     Make KEY do nothing in the currently selected keymap.  Returns
     non-zero in case of error.

 - Function: int rl_unbind_key_in_map (INT KEY, KEYMAP MAP)
     Make KEY be bound to the null function in MAP.  Returns non-zero
     in case of error.

 - Function: rl_generic_bind (INT TYPE, CHAR *KEYSEQ, CHAR *DATA,
          KEYMAP MAP)
     Bind the key sequence represented by the string KEYSEQ to the
     arbitrary pointer DATA.  TYPE says what kind of data is pointed to
     by DATA; right now this can be a function (`ISFUNC'), a macro
     (`ISMACR'), or a keymap (`ISKMAP').  This makes new keymaps as
     necessary.  The initial place to do bindings is in MAP.


File: readline.info,  Node: Function Writing,  Next: Allowing Undoing,  Prev: Binding Keys,  Up: Custom Functions

Writing a New Function
----------------------

   In order to write new functions for Readline, you need to know the
calling conventions for keyboard invoked functions, and the names of the
variables that describe the current state of the line gathered so far.

 - Variable: char *rl_line_buffer
     This is the line gathered so far.  You are welcome to modify the
     contents of this, but see Undoing, below.

 - Variable: int rl_point
     The offset of the current cursor position in RL_LINE_BUFFER.

 - Variable: int rl_end
     The number of characters present in `rl_line_buffer'.  When
     `rl_point' is at the end of the line, then `rl_point' and `rl_end'
     are equal.

   The calling sequence for a command `foo' looks like

     `foo (int count, int key)'

   where COUNT is the numeric argument (or 1 if defaulted) and KEY is
the key that invoked this function.

   It is completely up to the function as to what should be done with
the numeric argument; some functions use it as a repeat count, other
functions as a flag, and some choose to ignore it.  In general, if a
function uses the numeric argument as a repeat count, it should be able
to do something useful with a negative argument as well as a positive
argument.  At the very least, it should be aware that it can be passed a
negative argument.


File: readline.info,  Node: Allowing Undoing,  Prev: Function Writing,  Up: Custom Functions

Allowing Undoing
----------------

   Supporting the undo command is a painless thing to do, and makes your
functions much more useful to the end user.  It is certainly easy to try
something if you know you can undo it.  I could use an undo function for
the stock market.

   If your function simply inserts text once, or deletes text once, and
it calls `rl_insert_text ()' or `rl_delete_text ()' to do it, then
undoing is already done for you automatically, and you can safely skip
this section.

   If you do multiple insertions or multiple deletions, or any
combination of these operations, you should group them together into
one operation.  This can be done with `rl_begin_undo_group ()' and
`rl_end_undo_group ()'.

 - Function: rl_begin_undo_group ()
     Begins saving undo information in a group construct.  The undo
     information usually comes from calls to `rl_insert_text ()' and
     `rl_delete_text ()', but they could be direct calls to
     `rl_add_undo ()'.

 - Function: rl_end_undo_group ()
     Closes the current undo group started with `rl_begin_undo_group
     ()'.  There should be exactly one call to `rl_end_undo_group ()'
     for every call to `rl_begin_undo_group ()'.

   Finally, if you neither insert nor delete text, but directly modify
the existing text (e.g. change its case), you call `rl_modifying ()'
once, just before you modify the text.  You must supply the indices of
the text range that you are going to modify.

 - Function: rl_modifying (INT START, INT END)
     Tell Readline to save the text between START and END as a single
     undo unit.  It is assumed that subsequent to this call you will
     modify that range of text in some way.

An Example
----------

   Here is a function which changes lowercase characters to the
uppercase equivalents, and uppercase characters to the lowercase
equivalents.  If this function was bound to `M-c', then typing `M-c'
would change the case of the character under point.  Typing `10 M-c'
would change the case of the following 10 characters, leaving the
cursor on the last character changed.

     /* Invert the case of the COUNT following characters. */
     invert_case_line (count, key)
          int count, key;
     {
       register int start, end;
     
       start = rl_point;
     
       if (count < 0)
         {
           direction = -1;
           count = -count;
         }
       else
         direction = 1;
     
       /* Find the end of the range to modify. */
       end = start + (count * direction);
     
       /* Force it to be within range. */
       if (end > rl_end)
         end = rl_end;
       else if (end < 0)
         end = -1;
     
       if (start > end)
         {
           int temp = start;
           start = end;
           end = temp;
         }
     
       if (start == end)
         return;
     
       /* Tell readline that we are modifying the line, so save the undo
          information. */
       rl_modifying (start, end);
     
       for (; start != end; start += direction)
         {
           if (uppercase_p (rl_line_buffer[start]))
             rl_line_buffer[start] = to_lower (rl_line_buffer[start]);
           else if (lowercase_p (rl_line_buffer[start]))
             rl_line_buffer[start] = to_upper (rl_line_buffer[start]);
         }
       /* Move point to on top of the last character changed. */
       rl_point = end - direction;
     }

Custom Completers
=================

   Typically, a program that reads commands from the user has a way of
disambiguating commands and data.  If your program is one of these, then
it can provide completion for either commands, or data, or both commands
and data.  The following sections describe how your program and Readline
cooperate to provide this service to end users.

* Menu:

* How Completing Works::	The logic used to do completion.
* Completion Functions::	Functions provided by Readline.
* Completion Variables::	Variables which control completion.
* A Short Completion Example::	An example of writing completer subroutines.


File: readline.info,  Node: How Completing Works,  Next: Completion Functions,  Up: Custom Completers

How Completing Works
--------------------

   In order to complete some text, the full list of possible completions
must be available.  That is to say, it is not possible to accurately
expand a partial word without knowing what all of the possible words
that make sense in that context are.  The GNU Readline library provides
the user interface to completion, and additionally, two of the most
common completion functions; filename and username.  For completing
other types of text, you must write your own completion function.  This
section describes exactly what those functions must do, and provides an
example function.

   There are three major functions used to perform completion:

  1. The user-interface function `rl_complete ()'.  This function is
     called interactively with the same calling conventions as other
     functions in readline intended for interactive use; i.e. COUNT,
     and INVOKING-KEY.  It isolates the word to be completed and calls
     `completion_matches ()' to generate a list of possible completions.
     It then either lists the possible completions or actually performs
     the completion, depending on which behaviour is desired.

  2. The internal function `completion_matches ()' uses your
     "generator" function to generate the list of possible matches, and
     then returns the array of these matches.  You should place the
     address of your generator function in
     `rl_completion_entry_function'.

  3. The generator function is called repeatedly from
     `completion_matches ()', returning a string each time.  The
     arguments to the generator function are TEXT and STATE.  TEXT is
     the partial word to be completed.  STATE is zero the first time
     the function is called, and a positive non-zero integer for each
     subsequent call.  When the generator function returns `(char
     *)NULL' this signals `completion_matches ()' that there are no more
     possibilities left.


 - Function: rl_complete (INT IGNORE, INT INVOKING_KEY)
     Complete the word at or before point.  You have supplied the
     function that does the initial simple matching selection algorithm
     (see `completion_matches ()').  The default is to do filename
     completion.

   Note that `rl_complete ()' has the identical calling conventions as
any other key-invokable function; this is because by default it is bound
to the `TAB' key.

 - Variable: Function *rl_completion_entry_function
     This is a pointer to the generator function for `completion_matches
     ()'.  If the value of `rl_completion_entry_function' is `(Function
     *)NULL' then the default filename generator function is used,
     namely `filename_entry_function ()'.


File: readline.info,  Node: Completion Functions,  Next: Completion Variables,  Prev: How Completing Works,  Up: Custom Completers

Completion Functions
--------------------

   Here is the complete list of callable completion functions present in
Readline.

 - Function: rl_complete_internal (INT WHAT_TO_DO)
     Complete the word at or before point.  WHAT_TO_DO says what to do
     with the completion.  A value of `?' means list the possible
     completions.  `TAB' means do standard completion.  `*' means
     insert all of the possible completions.

 - Function: rl_complete (INT IGNORE, INT INVOKING_KEY)
     Complete the word at or before point.  You have supplied the
     function that does the initial simple matching selection algorithm
     (see `completion_matches ()').  The default is to do filename
     completion.  This just calls `rl_complete_internal ()' with an
     argument of `TAB'.

 - Function: rl_possible_completions ()
     List the possible completions.  See description of `rl_complete
     ()'.  This just calls `rl_complete_internal ()' with an argument of
     `?'.

 - Function: char **completion_matches (CHAR *TEXT, CHAR
          *(*ENTRY_FUNCTION) ())
     Returns an array of `(char *)' which is a list of completions for
     TEXT.  If there are no completions, returns `(char **)NULL'.  The
     first entry in the returned array is the substitution for TEXT.
     The remaining entries are the possible completions.  The array is
     terminated with a `NULL' pointer.

     ENTRY_FUNCTION is a function of two args, and returns a `(char
     *)'.  The first argument is TEXT.  The second is a state argument;
     it is zero on the first call, and non-zero on subsequent calls.
     It returns a `NULL'  pointer to the caller when there are no more
     matches.

 - Function: char *filename_completion_function (CHAR *TEXT, INT STATE)
     A generator function for filename completion in the general case.
     Note that completion in the Bash shell is a little different
     because of all the pathnames that must be followed when looking up
     the completion for a command.

 - Function: char *username_completion_function (CHAR *TEXT, INT STATE)
     A completion generator for usernames.  TEXT contains a partial
     username preceded by a random character (usually `~').


File: readline.info,  Node: Completion Variables,  Next: A Short Completion Example,  Prev: Completion Functions,  Up: Custom Completers

Completion Variables
--------------------

 - Variable: Function *rl_completion_entry_function
     A pointer to the generator function for `completion_matches ()'.
     `NULL' means to use `filename_entry_function ()', the default
     filename completer.

 - Variable: Function *rl_attempted_completion_function
     A pointer to an alternative function to create matches.  The
     function is called with TEXT, START, and END.  START and END are
     indices in `rl_line_buffer' saying what the boundaries of TEXT
     are.  If this function exists and returns `NULL' then `rl_complete
     ()' will call the value of `rl_completion_entry_function' to
     generate matches, otherwise the array of strings returned will be
     used.

 - Variable: int rl_completion_query_items
     Up to this many items will be displayed in response to a
     possible-completions call.  After that, we ask the user if she is
     sure she wants to see them all.  The default value is 100.

 - Variable: char *rl_basic_word_break_characters
     The basic list of characters that signal a break between words for
     the completer routine.  The contents of this variable is what
     breaks words in the Bash shell, i.e. " \t\n\"\\'`@$><=;|&{(".

 - Variable: char *rl_completer_word_break_characters
     The list of characters that signal a break between words for
     `rl_complete_internal ()'.  The default list is the contents of
     `rl_basic_word_break_characters'.

 - Variable: char *rl_special_prefixes
     The list of characters that are word break characters, but should
     be left in TEXT when it is passed to the completion function.
     Programs can use this to help determine what kind of completing to
     do.

 - Variable: int rl_ignore_completion_duplicates
     If non-zero, then disallow duplicates in the matches.  Default is
     1.

 - Variable: int rl_filename_completion_desired
     Non-zero means that the results of the matches are to be treated as
     filenames.  This is *always* zero on entry, and can only be changed
     within a completion entry generator function.

 - Variable: Function *rl_ignore_some_completions_function
     This function, if defined, is called by the completer when real
     filename completion is done, after all the matching names have
     been generated.  It is passed a `NULL' terminated array of `(char
     *)' known as MATCHES in the code.  The 1st element (`matches[0]')
     is the maximal substring that is common to all matches. This
     function can re-arrange the list of matches as required, but each
     deleted element of the array must be `free()''d.
