<H1><A NAME="SEC1" HREF="readline_toc.html#TOC1">Command Line Editing</A></H1>

<P>
This chapter describes the basic features of the GNU
command line editing interface.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="readline_toc.html#TOC2">Introduction to Line Editing</A></H2>

<P>
The following paragraphs describe the notation used to represent
keystrokes.

</P>
<P>
The text <KBD>C-k</KBD> is read as `Control-K' and describes the character
produced when the <KBD>k</KBD> key is pressed while the Control key
is depressed.

</P>
<P>
The text <KBD>M-k</KBD> is read as `Meta-K' and describes the character
produced when the meta key (if you have one) is depressed, and the <KBD>k</KBD>
key is pressed.  If you do not have a meta key, the identical keystroke
can be generated by typing <KBD>ESC</KBD> <I>first</I>, and then typing <KBD>k</KBD>.
Either process is known as <STRONG>metafying</STRONG> the <KBD>k</KBD> key.

</P>
<P>
The text <KBD>M-C-k</KBD> is read as `Meta-Control-k' and describes the
character produced by <STRONG>metafying</STRONG> <KBD>C-k</KBD>.

</P>
<P>
In addition, several keys have their own names.  Specifically,
<KBD>DEL</KBD>, <KBD>ESC</KBD>, <KBD>LFD</KBD>, <KBD>SPC</KBD>, <KBD>RET</KBD>, and <KBD>TAB</KBD> all
stand for themselves when seen in this text, or in an init file
(@xref{Readline Init File}).

<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="readline_toc.html#TOC3">Readline Interaction</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1"></A>

</P>
<P>
Often during an interactive session you type in a long line of text,
only to notice that the first word on the line is misspelled.  The
Readline library gives you a set of commands for manipulating the text
as you type it in, allowing you to just fix your typo, and not forcing
you to retype the majority of the line.  Using these editing commands,
you move the cursor to the place that needs correction, and delete or
insert the text of the corrections.  Then, when you are satisfied with
the line, you simply press <KBD>RETURN</KBD>.  You do not have to be at the
end of the line to press <KBD>RETURN</KBD>; the entire line is accepted
regardless of the location of the cursor within the line.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="readline_toc.html#TOC4">Readline Init File Syntax</A></H3>

<P>
There are only a few basic constructs allowed in the
Readline init file.  Blank lines are ignored.
Lines beginning with a <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> are comments.
Lines beginning with a <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> indicate conditional
constructs (see section <A HREF="readline.html#SEC5">Conditional Init Constructs</A>).  Other lines
denote variable settings and key bindings.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT>Variable Settings
<DD>
You can change the state of a few variables in Readline by
using the <CODE>set</CODE> command within the init file.  Here is how you
would specify that you wish to use <CODE>vi</CODE> line editing commands:


<PRE>
set editing-mode vi
</PRE>

Right now, there are only a few variables which can be set;
so few, in fact, that we just list them here:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>bell-style</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX2"></A>
Controls what happens when Readline wants to ring the terminal bell.
If set to <SAMP>`none'</SAMP>, Readline never rings the bell.  If set to
<SAMP>`visible'</SAMP>, Readline uses a visible bell if one is available.
If set to <SAMP>`audible'</SAMP> (the default), Readline attempts to ring
the terminal's bell.

<DT><CODE>comment-begin</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX3"></A>
The string to insert at the beginning of the line when the
<CODE>insert-comment</CODE> command is executed.  The default value
is <CODE>"#"</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>completion-query-items</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX4"></A>
The number of possible completions that determines when the user is
asked whether he wants to see the list of possibilities.  If the
number of possible completions is greater than this value,
Readline will ask the user whether or not he wishes to view
them; otherwise, they are simply listed.  The default limit is
<CODE>100</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>convert-meta</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX5"></A>
If set to <SAMP>`on'</SAMP>, Readline will convert characters with the
eigth bit set to an ASCII key sequence by stripping the eigth
bit and prepending an <KBD>ESC</KBD> character, converting them to a
meta-prefixed key sequence.  The default value is <SAMP>`on'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>disable-completion</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX6"></A>
If set to <SAMP>`On'</SAMP>, readline will inhibit word completion.
Completion  characters will be inserted into the line as if they had
been mapped to <CODE>self-insert</CODE>.  The default is <SAMP>`off'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>editing-mode</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX7"></A>
The <CODE>editing-mode</CODE> variable controls which editing mode you are
using.  By default, Readline starts up in Emacs editing mode, where
the keystrokes are most similar to Emacs.  This variable can be
set to either <SAMP>`emacs'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`vi'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>enable-keypad</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX8"></A>
When set to <SAMP>`on'</SAMP>, readline will try to enable the application
keypad when it is called.  Some systems need this to enable the
arrow keys.  The default is <SAMP>`off'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>expand-tilde</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX9"></A>
If set to <SAMP>`on'</SAMP>, tilde expansion is performed when Readline
attempts word completion.  The default is <SAMP>`off'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>horizontal-scroll-mode</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX10"></A>
This variable can be set to either <SAMP>`on'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`off'</SAMP>.  Setting it
to <SAMP>`on'</SAMP> means that the text of the lines that you edit will scroll
horizontally on a single screen line when they are longer than the width
of the screen, instead of wrapping onto a new screen line.  By default,
this variable is set to <SAMP>`off'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>keymap</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX11"></A>
Sets Readline's idea of the current keymap for key binding commands.
Acceptable <CODE>keymap</CODE> names are
<CODE>emacs</CODE>,
<CODE>emacs-standard</CODE>,
<CODE>emacs-meta</CODE>,
<CODE>emacs-ctlx</CODE>,
<CODE>vi</CODE>,
<CODE>vi-command</CODE>, and
<CODE>vi-insert</CODE>.
<CODE>vi</CODE> is equivalent to <CODE>vi-command</CODE>; <CODE>emacs</CODE> is
equivalent to <CODE>emacs-standard</CODE>.  The default value is <CODE>emacs</CODE>.
The value of the <CODE>editing-mode</CODE> variable also affects the
default keymap.

<DT><CODE>mark-directories</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <SAMP>`on'</SAMP>, completed directory names have a slash
appended.  The default is <SAMP>`on'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>mark-modified-lines</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX12"></A>
This variable, when set to <SAMP>`on'</SAMP>, says to display an asterisk
(<SAMP>`*'</SAMP>) at the start of history lines which have been modified.
This variable is <SAMP>`off'</SAMP> by default.

<DT><CODE>input-meta</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX13"></A>
<A NAME="IDX14"></A>
If set to <SAMP>`on'</SAMP>, Readline will enable eight-bit input (it
will not strip the eighth bit from the characters it reads),
regardless of what the terminal claims it can support.  The
default value is <SAMP>`off'</SAMP>.  The name <CODE>meta-flag</CODE> is a
synonym for this variable.

<DT><CODE>output-meta</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>
If set to <SAMP>`on'</SAMP>, Readline will display characters with the
eighth bit set directly rather than as a meta-prefixed escape
sequence.  The default is <SAMP>`off'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>show-all-if-ambiguous</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX16"></A>
This alters the default behavior of the completion functions.  If
set to <SAMP>`on'</SAMP>, 
words which have more than one possible completion cause the
matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the bell.
The default value is <SAMP>`off'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>visible-stats</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX17"></A>
If set to <SAMP>`on'</SAMP>, a character denoting a file's type
is appended to the filename when listing possible
completions.  The default is <SAMP>`off'</SAMP>.

</DL>

<DT>Key Bindings
<DD>
The syntax for controlling key bindings in the init file is
simple.  First you have to know the name of the command that you
want to change.  The following pages contain tables of the command name,
the default keybinding, and a short description of what the command
does.

Once you know the name of the command, simply place the name of the key
you wish to bind the command to, a colon, and then the name of the
command on a line in the init file.  The name of the key
can be expressed in different ways, depending on which is most
comfortable for you.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><VAR>keyname</VAR>: <VAR>function-name</VAR> or <VAR>macro</VAR>
<DD>
<VAR>keyname</VAR> is the name of a key spelled out in English.  For example:

<PRE>
Control-u: universal-argument
Meta-Rubout: backward-kill-word
Control-o: "&#62; output"
</PRE>

In the above example, <SAMP>`C-u'</SAMP> is bound to the function
<CODE>universal-argument</CODE>, and <SAMP>`C-o'</SAMP> is bound to run the macro
expressed on the right hand side (that is, to insert the text
<SAMP>`&#62; output'</SAMP> into the line).

<DT>"<VAR>keyseq</VAR>": <VAR>function-name</VAR> or <VAR>macro</VAR>
<DD>
<VAR>keyseq</VAR> differs from <VAR>keyname</VAR> above in that strings
denoting an entire key sequence can be specified, by placing
the key sequence in double quotes.  Some GNU Emacs style key
escapes can be used, as in the following example, but the
special character names are not recognized.


<PRE>
"\C-u": universal-argument
"\C-x\C-r": re-read-init-file
"\e[11~": "Function Key 1"
</PRE>

In the above example, <SAMP>`C-u'</SAMP> is bound to the function
<CODE>universal-argument</CODE> (just as it was in the first example),
<SAMP>`C-x C-r'</SAMP> is bound to the function <CODE>re-read-init-file</CODE>, and
<SAMP>`ESC [ 1 1 ~'</SAMP> is bound to insert the text <SAMP>`Function Key 1'</SAMP>.
The following escape sequences are available when specifying key
sequences:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE><KBD>\C-</KBD></CODE>
<DD>
control prefix
<DT><CODE><KBD>\M-</KBD></CODE>
<DD>
meta prefix
<DT><CODE><KBD>\e</KBD></CODE>
<DD>
an escape character
<DT><CODE><KBD>\\</KBD></CODE>
<DD>
backslash
<DT><CODE><KBD>\"</KBD></CODE>
<DD>
<KBD>"</KBD>
<DT><CODE><KBD>\'</KBD></CODE>
<DD>
<KBD>'</KBD>
</DL>

When entering the text of a macro, single or double quotes should
be used to indicate a macro definition.  Unquoted text
is assumed to be a function name.  Backslash
will quote any character in the macro text, including <SAMP>`"'</SAMP>
and <SAMP>`''</SAMP>.
For example, the following binding will make <SAMP>`C-x \'</SAMP>
insert a single <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> into the line:

<PRE>
"\C-x\\": "\\"
</PRE>

</DL>
</DL>



<H3><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="readline_toc.html#TOC5">Conditional Init Constructs</A></H3>

<P>
Readline implements a facility similar in spirit to the conditional
compilation features of the C preprocessor which allows key
bindings and variable settings to be performed as the result
of tests.  There are three parser directives used.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>$if</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>$if</CODE> construct allows bindings to be made based on the
editing mode, the terminal being used, or the application using
Readline.  The text of the test extends to the end of the line;
no characters are required to isolate it.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>mode</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>mode=</CODE> form of the <CODE>$if</CODE> directive is used to test
whether Readline is in <CODE>emacs</CODE> or <CODE>vi</CODE> mode.
This may be used in conjunction
with the <SAMP>`set keymap'</SAMP> command, for instance, to set bindings in
the <CODE>emacs-standard</CODE> and <CODE>emacs-ctlx</CODE> keymaps only if
Readline is starting out in <CODE>emacs</CODE> mode.

<DT><CODE>term</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>term=</CODE> form may be used to include terminal-specific
key bindings, perhaps to bind the key sequences output by the
terminal's function keys.  The word on the right side of the
<SAMP>`='</SAMP> is tested against the full name of the terminal and the
portion of the terminal name before the first <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>.  This
allows <CODE>sun</CODE> to match both <CODE>sun</CODE> and <CODE>sun-cmd</CODE>,
for instance.

<DT><CODE>application</CODE>
<DD>
The <VAR>application</VAR> construct is used to include
application-specific settings.  Each program using the Readline
library sets the <VAR>application name</VAR>, and you can test for it. 
This could be used to bind key sequences to functions useful for
a specific program.  For instance, the following command adds a
key sequence that quotes the current or previous word in Bash:

<PRE>
$if Bash
# Quote the current or previous word
"\C-xq": "\eb\"\ef\""
$endif
</PRE>

</DL>

<DT><CODE>$endif</CODE>
<DD>
This command, as you saw in the previous example, terminates an
<CODE>$if</CODE> command.

<DT><CODE>$else</CODE>
<DD>
Commands in this branch of the <CODE>$if</CODE> directive are executed if
the test fails.
</DL>

inserts the <VAR>n</VAR>th word from the end of the previous command.

<DT><CODE>yank-last-arg (M-., M-_)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX38"></A>
Insert last argument to the previous command (the last word of the
previous history entry).  With an

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>digit-argument (M-0, M-1, ... M--)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX63"></A>
Add this digit to the argument already accumulating, or start a new
argument.  <KBD>M--</KBD> starts a negative argument.

<DT><CODE>universal-argument ()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX64"></A>
This is another way to specify an argument.
If this command is followed by one or more digits, optionally with a
leading minus sign, those digits define the argument.
If the command is followed by digits, executing <CODE>universal-argument</CODE>
again ends the numeric argument, but is otherwise ignored.
As a special case, if this command is immediately followed by a
character that is neither a digit or minus sign, the argument count
for the next command is multiplied by four.
The argument count is initially one, so executing this function the
first time makes the argument count four, a second time makes the
argument count sixteen, and so on.
By default, this is not bound to a key.

<H2><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="readline_toc.html#TOC16">Readline vi Mode</A></H2>

<P>
While the Readline library does not have a full set of <CODE>vi</CODE>
editing functions, it does contain enough to allow simple editing
of the line.  The Readline <CODE>vi</CODE> mode behaves as specified in
the POSIX 1003.2 standard.

</P>
<P>
In order to switch interactively between <CODE>emacs</CODE> and <CODE>vi</CODE>
editing modes, use the command M-C-j (toggle-editing-mode).
The Readline default is <CODE>emacs</CODE> mode.

</P>
<P>
When you enter a line in <CODE>vi</CODE> mode, you are already placed in
`insertion' mode, as if you had typed an <SAMP>`i'</SAMP>.  Pressing <KBD>ESC</KBD>
switches you into `command' mode, where you can edit the text of the
line with the standard <CODE>vi</CODE> movement keys, move to previous
history lines with <SAMP>`k'</SAMP> and subsequent lines with <SAMP>`j'</SAMP>, and
so forth.

</P>



<H1><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="readline_toc.html#TOC17">Programming with GNU Readline</A></H1>

<P>
This chapter describes the interface between the GNU Readline Library and
other programs.  If you are a programmer, and you wish to include the
features found in GNU Readline
such as completion, line editing, and interactive history manipulation
in your own programs, this section is for you.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="readline_toc.html#TOC18">Basic Behavior</A></H2>

<P>
Many programs provide a command line interface, such as <CODE>mail</CODE>,
<CODE>ftp</CODE>, and <CODE>sh</CODE>.  For such programs, the default behaviour of
Readline is sufficient.  This section describes how to use Readline in
the simplest way possible, perhaps to replace calls in your code to
<CODE>gets()</CODE> or <CODE>fgets ()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX86"></A>
<A NAME="IDX87"></A>
The function <CODE>readline ()</CODE> prints a prompt and then reads and returns
a single line of text from the user.  The line <CODE>readline</CODE>
returns is allocated with <CODE>malloc ()</CODE>; you should <CODE>free ()</CODE>
the line when you are done with it.  The declaration for <CODE>readline</CODE>
in ANSI C is

</P>

<PRE>
<CODE>char *readline (char *<VAR>prompt</VAR>);</CODE>
</PRE>

<P>
So, one might say

<PRE>
<CODE>char *line = readline ("Enter a line: ");</CODE>
</PRE>

<P>
in order to read a line of text from the user.
The line returned has the final newline removed, so only the
text remains.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>readline</CODE> encounters an <CODE>EOF</CODE> while reading the line, and the
line is empty at that point, then <CODE>(char *)NULL</CODE> is returned.
Otherwise, the line is ended just as if a newline had been typed.

</P>
<P>
If you want the user to be able to get at the line later, (with
<KBD>C-p</KBD> for example), you must call <CODE>add_history ()</CODE> to save the
line away in a <STRONG>history</STRONG> list of such lines.

</P>

<PRE>
<CODE>add_history (line)</CODE>;
</PRE>

<P>
For full details on the GNU History Library, see the associated manual.

</P>
<P>
It is preferable to avoid saving empty lines on the history list, since
users rarely have a burning need to reuse a blank line.  Here is
a function which usefully replaces the standard <CODE>gets ()</CODE> library
function, and has the advantage of no static buffer to overflow:

</P>

<PRE>
/* A static variable for holding the line. */
static char *line_read = (char *)NULL;

/* Read a string, and return a pointer to it.  Returns NULL on EOF. */
char *
rl_gets ()
{
  /* If the buffer has already been allocated, return the memory
     to the free pool. */
  if (line_read)
    {
      free (line_read);
      line_read = (char *)NULL;
    }

  /* Get a line from the user. */
  line_read = readline ("");

  /* If the line has any text in it, save it on the history. */
  if (line_read &#38;&#38; *line_read)
    add_history (line_read);

  return (line_read);
}
</PRE>

<P>
This function gives the user the default behaviour of <KBD>TAB</KBD>
completion: completion on file names.  If you do not want Readline to
complete on filenames, you can change the binding of the <KBD>TAB</KBD> key
with <CODE>rl_bind_key ()</CODE>.

</P>

<PRE>
<CODE>int rl_bind_key (int <VAR>key</VAR>, int (*<VAR>function</VAR>)());</CODE>
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>rl_bind_key ()</CODE> takes two arguments: <VAR>key</VAR> is the character that
you want to bind, and <VAR>function</VAR> is the address of the function to
call when <VAR>key</VAR> is pressed.  Binding <KBD>TAB</KBD> to <CODE>rl_insert ()</CODE>
makes <KBD>TAB</KBD> insert itself.
<CODE>rl_bind_key ()</CODE> returns non-zero if <VAR>key</VAR> is not a valid
ASCII character code (between 0 and 255).

</P>
<P>
Thus, to disable the default <KBD>TAB</KBD> behavior, the following suffices:

<PRE>
<CODE>rl_bind_key ('\t', rl_insert);</CODE>
</PRE>

<P>
This code should be executed once at the start of your program; you
might write a function called <CODE>initialize_readline ()</CODE> which
performs this and other desired initializations, such as installing
custom completers (see section <A HREF="readline.html#SEC34">Custom Completers</A>).

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC19" HREF="readline_toc.html#TOC19">Custom Functions</A></H2>

<P>
Readline provides many functions for manipulating the text of
the line, but it isn't possible to anticipate the needs of all
programs.  This section describes the various functions and variables
defined within the Readline library which allow a user program to add
customized functionality to Readline.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC20" HREF="readline_toc.html#TOC20">The Function Type</A></H3>

<P>
For readabilty, we declare a new type of object, called
<STRONG>Function</STRONG>.  A <CODE>Function</CODE> is a C function which
returns an <CODE>int</CODE>.  The type declaration for <CODE>Function</CODE> is:

</P>
<P>
<CODE>typedef int Function ();</CODE>

</P>
<P>
The reason for declaring this new type is to make it easier to write
code describing pointers to C functions.  Let us say we had a variable
called <VAR>func</VAR> which was a pointer to a function.  Instead of the
classic C declaration

</P>
<P>
<CODE>int (*)()func;</CODE>

</P>
<P>
we may write

</P>
<P>
<CODE>Function *func;</CODE>

</P>
<P>
Similarly, there are

</P>

<PRE>
typedef void VFunction ();
typedef char *CPFunction (); and
typedef char **CPPFunction ();
</PRE>

<P>
for functions returning no value, <CODE>pointer to char</CODE>, and
<CODE>pointer to pointer to char</CODE>, respectively.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC21" HREF="readline_toc.html#TOC21">Writing a New Function</A></H3>

<P>
In order to write new functions for Readline, you need to know the
calling conventions for keyboard-invoked functions, and the names of the
variables that describe the current state of the line read so far.

</P>
<P>
The calling sequence for a command <CODE>foo</CODE> looks like

</P>

<PRE>
<CODE>foo (int count, int key)</CODE>
</PRE>

<P>
where <VAR>count</VAR> is the numeric argument (or 1 if defaulted) and
<VAR>key</VAR> is the key that invoked this function.

</P>
<P>
It is completely up to the function as to what should be done with the
numeric argument.  Some functions use it as a repeat count, some
as a flag, and others to choose alternate behavior (refreshing the current
line as opposed to refreshing the screen, for example).  Some choose to
ignore it.  In general, if a
function uses the numeric argument as a repeat count, it should be able
to do something useful with both negative and positive arguments.
At the very least, it should be aware that it can be passed a
negative argument.

</P>

<H3><A NAME="SEC24" HREF="readline_toc.html#TOC24">Naming a Function</A></H3>

<P>
The user can dynamically change the bindings of keys while using
Readline.  This is done by representing the function with a descriptive
name.  The user is able to type the descriptive name when referring to
the function.  Thus, in an init file, one might find

</P>

<PRE>
Meta-Rubout:	backward-kill-word
</PRE>

<P>
This binds the keystroke <KBD>Meta-Rubout</KBD> to the function
<EM>descriptively</EM> named <CODE>backward-kill-word</CODE>.  You, as the
programmer, should bind the functions you write to descriptive names as
well.  Readline provides a function for doing that:

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> int <B>rl_add_defun</B> <I>(char *name, Function *function, int key)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX106"></A>
Add <VAR>name</VAR> to the list of named functions.  Make <VAR>function</VAR> be
the function that gets called.  If <VAR>key</VAR> is not -1, then bind it to
<VAR>function</VAR> using <CODE>rl_bind_key ()</CODE>.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
Using this function alone is sufficient for most applications.  It is
the recommended way to add a few functions to the default functions that
Readline has built in.  If you need to do something other
than adding a function to Readline, you may need to use the
underlying functions described below.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC25" HREF="readline_toc.html#TOC25">Selecting a Keymap</A></H3>

<P>
Key bindings take place on a <STRONG>keymap</STRONG>.  The keymap is the
association between the keys that the user types and the functions that
get run.  You can make your own keymaps, copy existing keymaps, and tell
Readline which keymap to use.

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> Keymap <B>rl_make_bare_keymap</B> <I>()</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX107"></A>

</P>
<P>

<H3><A NAME="SEC28" HREF="readline_toc.html#TOC28">Allowing Undoing</A></H3>

<P>
Supporting the undo command is a painless thing, and makes your
functions much more useful.  It is certainly easy to try
something if you know you can undo it.  I could use an undo function for
the stock market.

</P>
<P>
If your function simply inserts text once, or deletes text once, and
uses <CODE>rl_insert_text ()</CODE> or <CODE>rl_delete_text ()</CODE> to do it, then
undoing is already done for you automatically.

</P>
<P>
If you do multiple insertions or multiple deletions, or any combination
of these operations, you should group them together into one operation.
This is done with <CODE>rl_begin_undo_group ()</CODE> and
<CODE>rl_end_undo_group ()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The types of events that can be undone are:

</P>

<PRE>
enum undo_code { UNDO_DELETE, UNDO_INSERT, UNDO_BEGIN, UNDO_END }; 
</PRE>

<P>
Notice that <CODE>UNDO_DELETE</CODE> means to insert some text, and
<CODE>UNDO_INSERT</CODE> means to delete some text.  That is, the undo code
tells undo what to undo, not how to undo it.  <CODE>UNDO_BEGIN</CODE> and
<CODE>UNDO_END</CODE> are tags added by <CODE>rl_begin_undo_group ()</CODE> and
<CODE>rl_end_undo_group ()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> int <B>rl_begin_undo_group</B> <I>()</I>

Finally, if you neither insert nor delete text, but directly modify the

<H2><A NAME="SEC34" HREF="readline_toc.html#TOC34">Custom Completers</A></H2>

<P>
Typically, a program that reads commands from the user has a way of
disambiguating commands and data.  If your program is one of these, then
it can provide completion for commands, data, or both.
The following sections describe how your program and Readline
cooperate to provide this service.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC35" HREF="readline_toc.html#TOC35">How Completing Works</A></H3>

<P>
In order to complete some text, the full list of possible completions
must be available.  That is, it is not possible to accurately
expand a partial word without knowing all of the possible words
which make sense in that context.  The Readline library provides
the user interface to completion, and two of the most common
completion functions:  filename and username.  For completing other types
of text, you must write your own completion function.  This section
describes exactly what such functions must do, and provides an example.

</P>
<P>
There are three major functions used to perform completion:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

The user-interface function <CODE>rl_complete ()</CODE>.  This function is
called with the same arguments as other Readline
functions intended for interactive use:  <VAR>count</VAR> and
<VAR>invoking_key</VAR>.  It isolates the word to be completed and calls
<CODE>completion_matches ()</CODE> to generate a list of possible completions.
It then either lists the possible completions, inserts the possible
completions, or actually performs the
completion, depending on which behavior is desired.

<LI>

The internal function <CODE>completion_matches ()</CODE> uses your
<STRONG>generator</STRONG> function to generate the list of possible matches, and
then returns the array of these matches.  You should place the address
of your generator function in <CODE>rl_completion_entry_function</CODE>.

<LI>

The generator function is called repeatedly from
<CODE>completion_matches ()</CODE>, returning a string each time.  The
arguments to the generator function are <VAR>text</VAR> and <VAR>state</VAR>.
<VAR>text</VAR> is the partial word to be completed.  <VAR>state</VAR> is zero the
first time the function is called, allowing the generator to perform
any necessary initialization, and a positive non-zero integer for
each subsequent call.  When the generator function returns
<CODE>(char *)NULL</CODE> this signals <CODE>completion_matches ()</CODE> that there are
no more possibilities left.  Usually the generator function computes the
list of possible completions when <VAR>state</VAR> is zero, and returns them
one at a time on subsequent calls.  Each string the generator function
returns as a match must be allocated with <CODE>malloc()</CODE>; Readline
frees the strings when it has finished with them.

</OL>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> int <B>rl_complete</B> <I>(int ignore, int invoking_key)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX162"></A>
Complete the word at or before point.  You have supplied the function

<CODE>completion_matches ()</CODE>).  The default is to do filename completion.

Here is the complete list of callable completion functions present in
Readline.

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> int <B>rl_complete_internal</B> <I>(int what_to_do)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX164"></A>
Complete the word at or before point.  <VAR>what_to_do</VAR> says what to do
with the completion.  A value of <SAMP>`?'</SAMP> means list the possible
completions.  <SAMP>`TAB'</SAMP> means do standard completion.  <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> means
insert all of the possible completions.  <SAMP>`!'</SAMP> means to display
all of the possible completions, if there is more than one, as well as
performing partial completion.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> int <B>rl_complete</B> <I>(int ignore, int invoking_key)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX165"></A>
Complete the word at or before point.  You have supplied the function
that does the initial simple matching selection algorithm (see
<CODE>completion_matches ()</CODE> and <CODE>rl_completion_entry_function</CODE>).
The default is to do filename
completion.  This calls <CODE>rl_complete_internal ()</CODE> with an
argument depending on <VAR>invoking_key</VAR>.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> int <B>rl_possible_completions</B> <I>(int count, int invoking_key))</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX166"></A>
List the possible completions.  See description of <CODE>rl_complete
()</CODE>.  This calls <CODE>rl_complete_internal ()</CODE> with an argument of
<SAMP>`?'</SAMP>.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> int <B>rl_insert_completions</B> <I>(int count, int invoking_key))</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX167"></A>
Insert the list of possible completions into the line, deleting the
partially-completed word.  See description of <CODE>rl_complete ()</CODE>.
This calls <CODE>rl_complete_internal ()</CODE> with an argument of <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> char ** <B>completion_matches</B> <I>(char *text, CPFunction *entry_func)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX168"></A>
Returns an array of <CODE>(char *)</CODE> which is a list of completions for
<VAR>text</VAR>.  If there are no completions, returns <CODE>(char **)NULL</CODE>.
The first entry in the returned array is the substitution for <VAR>text</VAR>.
The remaining entries are the possible completions.  The array is
terminated with a <CODE>NULL</CODE> pointer.

</P>
<P>
<VAR>entry_func</VAR> is a function of two args, and returns a
<CODE>(char *)</CODE>.  The first argument is <VAR>text</VAR>.  The second is a
state argument; it is zero on the first call, and non-zero on subsequent
calls.  <VAR>entry_func</VAR> returns a <CODE>NULL</CODE>  pointer to the caller
when there are no more matches.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> char * <B>filename_completion_function</B> <I>(char *text, int state)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX169"></A>
A generator function for filename completion in the general case.  Note
that completion in Bash is a little different because of all
the pathnames that must be followed when looking up completions for a
command.  The Bash source is a useful reference for writing custom
completion functions.
</DL>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> char * <B>username_completion_function</B> <I>(char *text, int state)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX170"></A>
A completion generator for usernames.  <VAR>text</VAR> contains a partial
username preceded by a random character (usually <SAMP>`~'</SAMP>).  As with all
completion generators, <VAR>state</VAR> is zero on the first call and non-zero
for subsequent calls.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Variable:</U> Function * <B>rl_completion_entry_function</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX171"></A>
A pointer to the generator function for <CODE>completion_matches ()</CODE>.
<CODE>NULL</CODE> means to use <CODE>filename_entry_function ()</CODE>, the default
filename completer.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Variable:</U> CPPFunction * <B>rl_attempted_completion_function</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX172"></A>
A pointer to an alternative function to create matches.
The function is called with <VAR>text</VAR>, <VAR>start</VAR>, and <VAR>end</VAR>.
<VAR>start</VAR> and <VAR>end</VAR> are indices in <CODE>rl_line_buffer</CODE> saying
what the boundaries of <VAR>text</VAR> are.  If this function exists and
returns <CODE>NULL</CODE>, or if this variable is set to <CODE>NULL</CODE>, then
<CODE>rl_complete ()</CODE> will call the value of
<CODE>rl_completion_entry_function</CODE> to generate matches, otherwise the
array of strings returned will be used.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Variable:</U> CPFunction * <B>rl_filename_quoting_function</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX173"></A>
A pointer to a function that will quote a filename in an application-
specific fashion.  This is called if filename completion is being
attempted and one of the characters in <CODE>rl_filename_quote_characters</CODE>
appears in a completed filename.  The function is called with
<VAR>text</VAR>, <VAR>match_type</VAR>, and <VAR>quote_pointer</VAR>.  The <VAR>text</VAR>
is the filename to be quoted.  The <VAR>match_type</VAR> is either
<CODE>SINGLE_MATCH</CODE>, if there is only one completion match, or
<CODE>MULT_MATCH</CODE>.  Some functions use this to decide whether or not to
insert a closing quote character.  The <VAR>quote_pointer</VAR> is a pointer
to any opening quote character the user typed.  Some functions choose
to reset this character.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Variable:</U> CPFunction * <B>rl_filename_dequoting_function</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX174"></A>
A pointer to a function that will remove application-specific quoting
characters from a filename before completion is attempted, so those
characters do not interfere with matching the text against names in
the filesystem.  It is called with <VAR>text</VAR>, the text of the word
to be dequoted, and <VAR>quote_char</VAR>, which is the quoting character 
that delimits the filename (usually <SAMP>`''</SAMP> or <SAMP>`"'</SAMP>).  If
<VAR>quote_char</VAR> is zero, the filename was not in an embedded string.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Variable:</U> Function * <B>rl_char_is_quoted_p</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX175"></A>
A pointer to a function to call that determines whether or not a specific
character in the line buffer is quoted, according to whatever quoting
mechanism the program calling readline uses.  The function is called with
two arguments: <VAR>text</VAR>, the text of the line, and <VAR>index</VAR>, the
index of the character in the line.  It is used to decide whether a
character found in <CODE>rl_completer_word_break_characters</CODE> should be
used to break words for the completer.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Variable:</U> int <B>rl_completion_query_items</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX176"></A>
Up to this many items will be displayed in response to a
possible-completions call.  After that, we ask the user if she is sure
she wants to see them all.  The default value is 100.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Variable:</U> char * <B>rl_basic_word_break_characters</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX177"></A>
The basic list of characters that signal a break between words for the
completer routine.  The default value of this variable is the characters
which break words for completion in Bash, i.e.,
<CODE>" \t\n\"\\'`@$&#62;&#60;=;|&#38;{("</CODE>.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Variable:</U> char * <B>rl_basic_quote_characters</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX178"></A>
List of quote characters which can cause a word break.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Variable:</U> char * <B>rl_completer_word_break_characters</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX179"></A>
The list of characters that signal a break between words for
<CODE>rl_complete_internal ()</CODE>.  The default list is the value of
<CODE>rl_basic_word_break_characters</CODE>.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Variable:</U> char * <B>rl_completer_quote_characters</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX180"></A>
List of characters which can be used to quote a substring of the line.
Completion occurs on the entire substring, and within the substring
<CODE>rl_completer_word_break_characters</CODE> are treated as any other character,
unless they also appear within this list.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Variable:</U> char * <B>rl_filename_quote_characters</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX181"></A>
A list of characters that cause a filename to be quoted by the completer
when they appear in a completed filename.  The default is empty.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Variable:</U> char * <B>rl_special_prefixes</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX182"></A>
The list of characters that are word break characters, but should be
left in <VAR>text</VAR> when it is passed to the completion function.
Programs can use this to help determine what kind of completing to do.
For instance, Bash sets this variable to "$@" so that it can complete
shell variables and hostnames.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Variable:</U> int <B>rl_completion_append_character</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX183"></A>
When a single completion alternative matches at the end of the command
line, this character is appended to the inserted completion text.  The
default is a space character (<SAMP>` '</SAMP>).  Setting this to the null
character (<SAMP>`\0'</SAMP>) prevents anything being appended automatically.
This can be changed in custom completion functions to
provide the "most sensible word separator character" according to
an application-specific command line syntax specification.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Variable:</U> int <B>rl_ignore_completion_duplicates</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX184"></A>
If non-zero, then disallow duplicates in the matches.  Default is 1.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Variable:</U> int <B>rl_filename_completion_desired</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX185"></A>
Non-zero means that the results of the matches are to be treated as
filenames.  This is <EM>always</EM> zero on entry, and can only be changed
within a completion entry generator function.  If it is set to a non-zero
value, directory names have a slash appended and Readline attempts to
quote completed filenames if they contain any embedded word break
characters.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Variable:</U> int <B>rl_filename_quoting_desired</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX186"></A>
Non-zero means that the results of the matches are to be quoted using
double quotes (or an application-specific quoting mechanism) if the
completed filename contains any characters in
<CODE>rl_filename_quote_chars</CODE>.  This is <EM>always</EM> non-zero
on entry, and can only be changed within a completion entry generator
function.  The quoting is effected via a call to the function pointed to
by <CODE>rl_filename_quoting_function</CODE>.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Variable:</U> int <B>rl_inhibit_completion</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX187"></A>
If this variable is non-zero, completion is inhibit&#60;ed.  The completion
character will be inserted as any other bound to <CODE>self-insert</CODE>.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Variable:</U> Function * <B>rl_ignore_some_completions_function</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX188"></A>
This function, if defined, is called by the completer when real filename
completion is done, after all the matching names have been generated.
It is passed a <CODE>NULL</CODE> terminated array of matches.
The first element (<CODE>matches[0]</CODE>) is the
maximal substring common to all matches. This function can
re-arrange the list of matches as required, but each element deleted
from the array must be freed.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Variable:</U> Function * <B>rl_directory_completion_hook</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX189"></A>
This function, if defined, is allowed to modify the directory portion
of filenames Readline completes.  It is called with the address of a
string (the current directory name) as an argument.  It could be used
to expand symbolic links or shell variables in pathnames.
</DL>
