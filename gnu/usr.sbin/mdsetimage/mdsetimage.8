.Sh NAME
.Nm mdsetimage
.Nd set kernel RAM disk image
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl svx
.Op Fl b Ar bfdname
.Ar kernel
.Ar image
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command copies the disk image specified by
.Ar image
into the memory disk storage area in
.Ar kernel .
The file system present in
.Ar image
will typically be used by the kernel
as the root file system.
.Pp
To recognize kernel executable format, the
.Fl b
flag specifies BFD name of kernel.
.Pp
If the
.Fl s
flags is given,
.Nm
will write back the actual disk image size back into
.Ar kernel .
.Pp
If the
.Fl v
flag is given,
.Nm
will print out status information as
it is copying the image.
.Pp
If the
.Fl x
flag is given,
.Nm
will extract the disk image from
.Ar kernel
into the file
.Ar image .
This is the opposite of the default behavior.
